      "a smart passage of arms occurred this afternoon between mr parnell and the secretary of state for war which was not only inopportunely raised but created impressions unfavourable to the bona fide italicised of mr hardy in consequence of further information received from ireland relating to the meath militia and sir john dillon refusal to all them to attend mass on certain days mr parnell decided to defer for a day or two his question on the subject in order to make an addition this intention he accordingly announced this afternoon and no objection was advanced until some time had elapsed and other matters had been proceeded with suddenly however mr hardy rose and after suggesting that there was something not quite proper in this postponement complained that by his question mr parnell cast an imputation upon himself mr hardy evidently alluding to the passage asking under what circumstances the rev hugh behan first letter to sir john dillon if no longer in existence had ceased to exist obviously the right hon gentleman was straining a point in order to make this charge and his expression of opinion that the house would not require him to answer that question is interpreted not without reasonable ground as a mere ruse to avoid replying to an awkward interrogation mr parnell promptly denied that any such imputation was intended or conveyed upon the secretary for war and it certainly is strange that mr hardy should have seized upon this occasion instead of waiting till the hon member should present his question to him to make his attack it is not usual to anticipate questions in this manner moreover there is reason to believe from mr hardy statement as to the other parts of the questions that he has been misinformed as to the facts and mr parnell will ask for the information he seeks notwithstanding this anticipatory statement with the following addition whether the secretary for war is aware that the meath militia quartered in barracks were not allowed out of barracks during mass time between the hours of first and second parade on the 6th and 27th may and if so what military duties they were discharging during that time\n",

large assemblage of persons belonging to this part of the county and who for some hours had anxiously awaited his arrival as the honourable gentleman subsequently stated in his speech the object of his visit was that he might see his friends of lower meath and that they might see him as during his candidature for the representation of the county he had not had any opportunity of visiting that part of it after an interval spent in martin hotel a temporary platform was erected and around it assembled a large body of people who were anxious to hear an address from one of the members of their county mr parnell mp who was received with loud applause stated that he wished to address his constituents in that part of the county and then proposed a resolution declaring their continued and unalterable adhesion to the caause of home rule religious education fixity of tenure with fair rents and amnesty to the political prisoners this resolution embraced some very important matters in the first place home rule which the representatives of the irish people should struggle for night and day and never desist till they attained it and they should with equal determination preserve till they obtained fixity of tenure for the irish tenantry religious education for the irish people and amnesty for the political prisoners applause it might have been supposed that as they were beaten last session they had been badly beaten but they were not they were gaining ground every day applause the irish people at all events had in their own hands the power of obtaining home rule and if they used it they would do so not merely in their own interest but in the interest of england they had got their hand on england throat and they should keep it there cheers what did wendell phillips say when he was chosen by the irishmen of america to speak in eulogy of the career of the immortal o'connell cheers what did he say in that address which put to shame the english pensionary who feared to deliver his address before the irish people he said that ireland had been raised from the weak and powerless position which she formerly occupied to that position which rendered her arbiter of the destinies of england cheers the irish people did not want to interfere with england they only wished to manage their owwn affairs would it not then be well that england should in time purchase peace with ireland and ask forgiveness for the cruel wrongs which she had done this country in the past she should accept the compromise which the irish people offered her if she waited too long she might be too late the irish representatives should attend to their duty by day and by night as long as they had the irish people at their back and any attempt to dissuade them should be put down with a strong hand there were persons foolish enough recently to think that because the attention of the irish people had been occupied when they were doing honour to the memory of o'connell they would not be quick enough to detect insidious attempts to reinstate english power in this country but they now found themselves baffled and destroyed without a political future before them in this country the honourable gentleman then spoke of the way in which the irish members attended to their duties in the house of commons and said he could give his time entirely to them because he had nothing else to do but there were others who made greater sacrifices than he did who went over to every important division and then returned to attend to their business at home to those men who made such sacrifices constituents should be lenient speaking on the question of home rule he said they were told that there was a great difference between home rule and repeal he however could never see the difference because before they got home rule the act of union should be repealed nobody ever doubted that then they heard talk about the constitution of that constitution contained some good points but it also contained some bad ones what would they think if the whole catholic people of ireland were to be excluded from the franchise and if they were to be deprived of the right to elect a catholic representative under that constitution the irish people could not elect a responsible minister every minister in this country at that period was paid by england and his duty was to carry out the policy of england which was just the same now as it was then they were told that they ought not to ask for anything less than repeal that repeal was their right and that other things were not their rights but the man who asked for home rule asked just for those things which would make repeal workable as far as he could see the only difference was a difference in name when it came to a question of details and of arrangement between england and ireland the irish people should have what they wanted the representatives of ireland dare not act contrary to the wishes of the irish people who would have at the proper time an opportunity of determining what they should have cheers mr parnell then discussed the question of tenant right and said that mr butt had promised to bring into parliament next year a bill embodying the principle of fixity of tenure at fair rents cheers for mr butt mr butt had done as much as any man for the irish tenants and the bill which he would introduce would preserve their interests they might not be able to pass the bill next session but they would do so in a very short time they should be able to do so when the whigs came back to power and he said this not because he was fond of the whigs but because he knew that whatever power the whigs should have it would be given to them by the home rule representatives of the irish people and they should do what the representatives of the people to them to do cheers this would not be a case of being beaten by big majorities it would be a case of one party out and the other in they would take all they could get and all they had a right to get the subject of education was one of the most important of the day unless their children were educated how could it be expected that they would grow up christian men and christian women honest industrious and god serving people the people should be educated under a system which they could cordially accept the irish people never cordially accepted the national system which had never succeeded and which would never succeed unless it was supported by the people the present government of england were in favour of religious education in england but they did not wish to give it to ireland because the majority of the people of this country were catholics and they did not wish because they were bigoted to give to catholics the same advantages that they would give to english protestants he was sorry to have to tell them that but it was the fact as far as he had been able to learn the protestants of ireland had always demanded religious schools and colleges till they found that if they got them they would also have to give a religious education to catholics who formed the majority but as soon as they found out they said they had better not agitate the question further however he believed that if the matter were properly put before the protestants of ireland they would not insist on this dog in the manger policy mr parnell then spoke in favour of improving the condition of the labouring classes in ireland he spoke strongly in favour of amnesty for the political prisoners whose sufferings in english prisons de described he declared he could not see what advantage england could have in detaining them in prison any longer in conclusion he urged that irishmen should unite and work together till they obtained self government for their country\n",

      "mr parnell said he had come to that meeting anxious to carry out those principles of harmony which the reverend gentleman had recommended hear hear they found themselves at the very outset he regretted to say enveloped in difficulty by the conduct of the hon secretary who in reading the minutes of the last meeting had abstracted from the freeman journal the very accurate report which had appeared in that paper of the proceedings after the lord mayor had left the chair hear hear it was alleged by mr dwyer that professor kavanagh was right in doing so because those proceedings were conducted by members who in mr kavanagh opinion were not members of this committee his lordship had lately assigned two indecipherable against the validity of his mr parnell's election to the chair on the last day of meeting and which he was sure his lordship would on reflection admit to be entirely unfounded the first objection urged against him was that he had not subscribed to the funds of the association mr parnell said it was true he had not been a contributor to the funds of the committee and for reasons which for the sake of harmony he should prefer not to specify he should however say that he was prepared to defend his conduct in that respect before any public body in ireland hear hear but although he did not subscribe to the funds of the committee he did subscribe to the other funds connected with the movement hear hear he subscribed to the expenses incurred and necessarily incurred in worthily carrying the celebration to a success hear hear he had subscribed to the funds of the two public bodies of his constituents in meath to assist them in taking part in the procession hear hear mr parnell resuming said that in addition to those he had subscribed to a public body in dublin also with the view of aiding them in more worthily contributing to the success of the procession chairman name them if you have no objection mr parnell said he had not the least objection to name them he had subscribed to the bakers of meath and the drogheda band to assist them in forming part of the procession and the amnesty association and he submitted that a good deal of the success and credit of the procession was owing to the contingents which came in from the outlying parts of the country to swell it and add to its imposing appearance hear hear every man was his own governor ruling and controlling himself that day hear hear he mr parnell could not believe that the lord mayor really desired to rule out and not to be recognised the thousands which had been subscribed in various ways that never reached the hands of the central committee or appeared on their list towards the main object of celebrating the memory of o'connell hear hear would it be said that those men who had come in most cases at great personal expense and inconvenience from remote parts of the country away from their business to attend the procession had not contributed to the celebration he considered those men had done their duty in taking part in the procession and he considered he had done his duty in assisting them to discharge theirs as far as his means allowed him hear hear with regard to the seccod objection that a circular was sent him by the committee requesting his co operation on the condition of being added to the list of honorary members he had never received such a circular he had before stated that he had not received that circular mr keegan i saw the circular directed to mr parnell wicklow address it was a few days subsequent to the resolution of mr t d sullivan mr parnell a circular informing me that as a member of parliament if i co operated with the committee i should be an honorary member of the committee mr keegan yes mr parnell well i was not a member of parliament for a month after laughter mr parnell i leave it to the meeting to consider what sort of recollection mr keegan must have of the matter laughter he said it was a few days after the resolution being passed which directed these circulars being sent to members of parliament i attach no importance to the recollection of mr keegan in the matter i entirely deny your lordship right to alter the constitution of this committee as it was defined at the national conference hear hear you have no more right to alter it than has the president of the united states or the queen of england or any other potentate to alter the constitution of the country over which he or she presides hear hear your lordship did not act upon the principle on which this committee is and should be governed namely by the voice of the majority when you left the chair on the last occasion and refused to put mr a m sullivan motion as being unworthy of your lordship dignity hear hear you then deprived the meeting of your support and left us to get along as best we could it would be well i think if you had put that resolution and taken the sense of the meeting on it without raising the question of the status of members of that committee for the first time hear hear we have here a duty to discharge not alone to ourselves but to those in the country who confided this money to our care as trustees to ourselves and our own reputations we owe it that this money should be expended only for the purposes originally intended and in a legal manner hear but if it be applied to any purpose against the wish and approval of the majority it will not be spent either legally or in accordance with the wishes of the country hear hear i would ask some gentlemen who have not taken a prominent part in this dispute to try and suggest some mode in which we may arrive at a peaceable and satisfactory settlement hear hear i should like to settle the matter finally to day but how are we to do so when our position and votes are questioned\n",

      "mr parnell then moved to report progress it being twenty minutes past twelve mr cross pointed out that clause having been already fully debated and there being no further amendments it would be convenient to add it to the bill and also clause which was not opposed in this appeal the home secretary was publicly and by private solicitation backed up by mr shaw lefevre mr cowper temple and other gentlemen who had taken part in the discussion mr parnell was nevertheless obdurate but on being challenged a second time was not heard in reply the motion accordingly fell to the ground but on the question that the clause pass mr parnell again raised his voice in the negative and captain nolan agreeing to tell with him the committee divided when the motion received the support of nine votes against on the figures being announced mr callan rose and said he not by a side wind but deliberately impugned the decision of the chairman on the occasion when mr parnell had opposed the passing of the second clause mr parnell he added had challenged the ruling of the chairman that the ayes had it for the passing of the clause amid loud and prolonged cheering mr cowen declared that if hon members in that part of the house deliberately impugned the decision of the chairman of committees it was well that it should be known that gentlemen sitting in that part of the house did not agree with him the fact that some gentlemen near him were under the impression that the business of the house should close at twelve o'clock but it was better for them to say so openly mr parnell having repudiated mr callan statement about the misunderstanding with the chairman mr callan amid loud laughter said he had made the statement the committee had heard on the authority of mr parnell at one o'clock this morning mr parnell amid a scene of confusion was addressing the committee and was followed by mr macdonald\n",

      "at o'clock to day mr parnell accompanied by the rev peter dooly p p rev john carolan p p rev eugene sheehy c c mr j j kelly m p and mr campbell m p left the railway hotel and drove out to castlegar for the purpose of addressing the electors there in reference to the election after having stopped for a short time in the house of the parish priest the rev john carolan he addressed a small crowd of persons who belonged to the village and who had assembled to hear what part they had to take in connection with the proceedings of to morrow the rev mr carolan said i have great pleasure in introducing to you the illustrious leader of the irish parliamentary party who has done us the high honour of coming here to address you and i am sure that we shall all remember with pride what we had the honour of a visit from the greatest parliamentary leader of his time cheers we have been always ardently attached to him and all i can say on your behalf is that that attachment to him shall always last cheers mr parnell who was received with loud cheers said people of castlegar i am obliged to you for having assembled in such numbers and on such short notice i am glad to be able to announce to you that the dispute in reference to the representation of galway has been settled by the self sacrifice of mr lynch and his friends who have retired in favour of the candidate captain o'shea recommended by me to the constituency cheers i shall take this opportunity of telling you that if i had known that mr lynch was coming forward for the representation i should have accepted him for i believe that he is an honest man and a gentleman in every way suited to represent with honesty and ability the people of galway but in the duty which has devolved on me as leader of the irish party and of the nation to advise the people of galway with regard to the selection of a candidate it became necessary for me ten days agoo to inquire as to whether there was any local candidate in existence who desired to offer himself to the constitutency and i was informed by mr t p o'connor that the only local candidate mr lynch would not offer himself that he had declined and that not under any circumstances could he be induced to offer himself for the representation it therefore became necessary for me to look to some outside person unconnected with galway for the best candidate i could find i therefore took it on myself to recommend captain o'shea but owing to some misunderstanding mr lynch was induced to put himself in opposition to mr o'shea a crisis of some gravity difficulty and danger then arose but as i have told you that crisis has happily terminated by the patriotic withdrawal of mr lynch cheers i wish now to say a few words in favour of mr o'shea and of his action in the last parliament and of his willingness to work with us i say that you may go to the poll and record your votes in his favour although mr lynch has withdrawn it will yet be necessary for you to go to the poll and record your votes for captain o'shea mr lynch name is on the ballot paper and it is possible that the tories and orangemen of galway will go and vote for lynch and endeavour to return him if the people do not come forward in sufficient numbers to return captain o'shea it will however not be mr lynch fault should they do so for he has done everything that an honourable man could do by withdrawing from the contest it will therefore be your duty to go to morrow to the poll and put a cross opposite the name of mr o'shea now with regard to mr o'shea candidature he represented the county of clare in the last parliament he was returned for the county of clare without my recommendation in fact he was not at that time my candidate but notwithstanding this fact immediately after his return in he came up to dublin and attended a meeting of the irish parliamentary party held in the city hall when the famous division took place on the question whether mr william shaw or i should be leader of the party and at that crisis in the history of ireland he cast his vote in my favour cheers my election on that occasion was carried by a majority of two votes and it is right for me to remember now the service then rendered by o'shea to me and in the cause of ireland cheers if he and one other had voted against me then i should have been deprived of the leadership of the party and many of the great things that have since been done would not have been accomplished there are men in the parliamentary party who did not vote for me on that occasion and if that be so why should not i remember that vote he then gave in my favour i have one fault to find with mr o'shea public action i repeatedly told him that i should not recommend his election unless that fault were amended and i declined to support him for galway till he had given me a promise that his conduct in future should not be open to that charge the only fault i found with him during the last parliament was that he constantly refused to sit on the same side of the house with us in opposition but he has now given me this promise and i guarantee to you that he has given me this promise that in future he will sit with us as the irish party therefore the last possible objection that could be raise aagainst him has disappeared cheers mr parnell then said that he had done his duty in this matter and that he had never led the country astray for the last eleven years he had worked and fought commencing with two men against six hundred and fifty they had held up the flag of ireland and had acquired strength till now wedge like they were now to drive into the heart of the enemy and split them to pieces and grind them to powder if they refused to ireland her rights cheers he had led ireland and the irish party straight and he was not now leading them in a crooked way he believed that the result of this election would show that galway and ireland had confidence in him he asked them to go to the poll and vote for captain o'shea and said that the cause of ireland was in their hands and that in a short time he should bring back the irish parliament to college green when they would be masters of their own destinies and of the destinies of their country loud cheers the rev peter dooley then made a speech in irish in the course of which he told them of the withdrawal of mr lynch and called on them to vote for captain o'shea father sheey also briefly addressed them to the same effect mr parnell then returned to galway and drove on to barna and by o'clock he again reached the railway hotel where he was loudly cheered by a large body of people who assembled in front of the hotel mr parnell proceeded to his rooms and shortly before o'clock accompanied by a number of influential local friends lay and clerical took up a position outside the steps of the hotel door and from which he addressed the meeting mr parnell who was received with loud cheers said fellow countrymen i feel very proud and very happy in being able to address so magnificent and vast a meeting of the people of galway but the circumstances under which this meeting has been called give me greater encouragement and greater hope than any that i have ever felt since i first entered into public life cheers the circumstances of the present contest have been well calculated to try your devotion and your spirit of union cheers and it is a remarkable fact that you should have stood the test it is a very remarkable fact i do not care to go into what has taken place during the last few days in your town and i say that under these circumstances in view of the events which have happened and of the speeches which have been made in this town during the last few days it is the most remarkable fact in irish history that the unity of our cause has been maintained cheers and now i wish to say a word or two with regard to the candidature of mr lynch now withdrawn i admire and i appreciate the spirit with which he entered into this candidature and i equally admire the spirit and the feelings and the temper he has exhibited in withdrawing his candidature had i known a few days sooner of mr lynch desire to represent this constituency i would have cheerfully yielded to that desire and had i not on the contrary been expressly informed that he would not on any account consent to come forward for this constituency mr lynch would have been your chosen man and to morrow he would have been my comrade as i hope that in the future he will be my comrade cheers but mr lynch was not willing at the time when my duty required me to consider the recommendation i should make to the constituency he was not willing to come forward and i was obliged to look for some person outside the people of galway to whom to give my recommendation and in that search of all the names of the gentlemen who were suggested to me of all the names which occurred to my own mind i came to the conclusion carefully and after full consideration that the name of captain o'shea some groans was the proper name to suggest for your consideration cheers after that conclusion was formed and after my recommendation had been made my conclusion was fixed mr lynch came forward but he has not retired and the history of this contest is a closed book to my mind cheers let me now say a word as to the merits of the candidature of the man who will be your member to morrow night i wish to speak also of his demerits and the faults i have had to find with him i shall be perfectly open in dealing with the question mr o'shea was returned for the county of clare in not as a member of my part he was returned unpledged to me and so far as i know he has both in letter and in spirit kept the pledges which he gave to the people of clare in cheers immediately after his return a meeting was held in the city hall in dublin of the newly elected irish members for the purpose of choosing a chairman i was nominated and i was proposed as chairman and leader of the party mr william shaw was also proposed twenty members of the party voted for mr william shaw and twenty two members voted for me mr o'shea was one of the twenty two members who voted for me and against mr shaw cheers if mr o'shea and one other member had voted for mr shaw and not for me i should not have been the chairman and leader of the irish party mr shaw would have been chairman and leader of the part and many proud things which have since been done for ireland and her present proud position could not have been accomplished i am examining mr o'shea public conduct and public records step by step and so far as i have gone i ask would it not have been very unfair for me if there are men in the present part who voted against me then if captain o'shea were left out of the party who voted for me then hear hear but such an isolated act as that would not in itself have been sufficient to give him a claim on me apart from any other consideration as far as i know his votes have been irreproachable i have been obliged to condemn him publicly because during the last parliament he refused to sit in opposition with the members of the irish party that is the only fault that i have been able to find with his public conduct he refused to sit in opposition but i considered that that was a fatal fault a fatal blemish and i repeatedly told him in the last parliament that unless he could see his way to sit on our side of the house i should not recommend him to the constituency of clare and he was not elected and was not returned to parliament although i supported him in liverpool for a seat which we could not carry ourselves and to which i considered he had the first claim but since this election commenced mr o'shea has given me a promise that he will sit on our side of the house and therefore my last objection to him has disappeared under these circumstances should i allow him to be persecuted and kept out of parliament i know that his return cannot be any injury to the national cause and cannot be any injury to the irish party he was the best man i knew of at the time and i recommended him as i already told you i did not know of mr lynch claims and having recommended him i was in my position bound not to recede one hair breadth not one jot hear hear but to carry through that recommendation to the bitter end and to test whether the people of galway and the people of ireland had that confidence in me which i believe they have and which i believe the result of this election will show they have during the eleven years since my entering into public life i have never led the irish people astray never led them into any crooked path i have never led the irish party astray when courage was required and was necessary for the interest of the irish nation i have shown it cheers and when moderation was necessary and when temperate judgment for the nation was necessary i have had the courage to show it and i shall never lead the party or the nation astray until we have gained for you the right to lead and govern yourselves cheers now fellow countrymen there are several gentlemen here who desire to address you i think i have said everything that it was necessary for me to say with regard to the candidature of mr o'shea i need only add this that you must not think that because mr lynch has retied it is not necessary for you to go to the poll to morrow and vote all of you who have votes must go and vote for mr o'shea for otherwise the tories might take advantage of the situation might go and poll for mr lynch in order if possible to run him close to the poll for mr o'shea this is not mr lynch fault mr lynch has acted honourably towards me and towards the party his name cannot now be withdrawn from the paper it must be on the ballot paper and there the tories have the opportunity of trying to play this dirty trick but you will defeat this dirty trick and you will give your vote not for lynch but for o'shea for the purpose of showing that you have voted for me and for ireland cheers i should have desired to have addressed you also apart from this election upon the great question of the day but i think that in view of the fact that father sheehy is her and will address you i shall not longer detain you i will only add in conclusion my conviction that the day is very near at hand when we shall have gained for ireland the right to make her own laws on irish soil cheers when that day comes i shall regard my mission as fulfilled i have not entered on this great struggle with any motive of personal ambition but it is my duty to stand by you till these measures are gained for you i have come down to galway to stand by you in your cause for any appearance of division in our party in the weakening of my authority would have been fatal to our cause and that is the reason why i am here and i confidently leave the result in your hands after many a month you will look back to the proceeding days with satisfaction for the results will have proved you have to day struck a great and successful blow for ireland loud cheers this evening in the hall of the young ireland society mr o'kelly m p delivered a very able and instructive lecture on the soudan and the mahdi the hall was crowded about half past o'clock mr parnell entered the hall and was received with loud cheers the whole audience standing up till he took his seat on the platform mr parnell who was received with loud applause seconded it and said he had listened with pleasure to the very interesting lecture which they had just heard he spoke of the facility which mr o'kelly enjoyed in the country itself of studying its features and of informing himself of the character of those brave arabs who fought for their independence when the soudan war commenced mr o'kelly penetrated as far as dongloa where he was stricken down having suffered from hunger and thirst and fever and where he was arrested by order of clifford lloyd laughter and applause he knew mr o'kelly sympathy with the arabs they recognised in him a lecturer of great power a man of deeds rather than of words a man of great talent silent but observant a man who he wished would more often come to the front and add to the laurels he had won in mexico cuba and in the soudan such forensic triumphs as he mr parnell knew he had the power of achieving loud cheers mr parnell then referred to the fact that mr lynch was in the chair a symbol fo their unity and he expressed a hope that before long mr lynch would be one of his colleagues fighting by his side not for years but for some months in parliament till they came back to their own country to develop their own resources and to manage their own affairs cheers\n",

districts in the constituency in favour of the candidature of captain o'shea whom he had nominated for the vacancy on addressing a small gathering of the electors at castlebar mr parnell explained the circumstances which led to the adoption of the candidature of captain o'shea in ignorance of the fact that mr lynch entertained any serious intention of coming forward and stated that he would have been only too happy to have accepted the latter had he known sooner of his willingness to stand he expressed the hope that he would be able to welcome mr lynch as a colleague at a future and not remote period and in fact he promised that he should have the next vacancy in the ranks of the irish parliamentary party mr parnell dwelt upon the services of captain o'shea in supporting him at a time when the irish leadership was in question and urged that under the circumstances he could not throw him over when mr lynch definitely came forward mr parnell remarks were received with favour by his audience and at barna a small hamlet on the shores of galway bay where he spoke to a small gathering of electors on the same subject he was also well received in the afternoon mr parnell addressed

which have been done for ireland from that day to this could never have been done there are men in the irish party of to day more than one man who voted against me on that occasion and if more than one man who voted against me is in the party to day why should o'shea not be in it who voted in my favour i will now proceed further i have had one fault to find with mr o'shea public action i have not concealed my views from him i have repeatedly told him that i could not support him at the general election that has just concluded for the representation of any irish constituency unless that fault were amended and i did not support him i declined to support him for galway until he had given me a promise that that fault should not be laid to his charge for the future the only fault that i

address so magnificent and vast a meeting of the people of galway but the circumstances under which this meeting has been called give me greater encouragement and greater hope than any that i ever felt since i first entered public life applause the circumstances of the present contest have been well calculated to try your devotion and your spirit of union hear hear but it is a remarkable fact that you have stood the test hear it is a very remarkable fact i do not care to go into what has taken place during the last few days in your town but i say that under these circumstances in the face of events that have happened and of speeches which have been made in those circumstances during the last few days it is perhaps the most remarkable fact in irish history that the unity of our cause has been maintained cheers a voice and will renewed cheers mr parnell and now i wish to say a word or two with regard to the candidature hear hear and i equally admire the spirit and the feeling and the temper he has exhibited in withdrawing his candidature had i known a few days sooner of mr lynch desire to represent his constituency i would have cheerfully yielded to that desire hear hear had i not on the contrary been expressly informed that mr lynch would on no account consent to come forward for this constituency mr lynch would have been my chosen man and to morrow he would have been my comrade as i hope that in future he will be my comrade hear hear but mr lynch was not willing and when my duty required me to consider the recommendation that i should make to the constituency he was not at the time willing to come forward and i was obliged to look for somebody outside the people of galway to give my recommendation to and in that search after a careful and full and fair examination of all the names of the gentlemen who were suggested to me of all the names of those which occurred to my own mind i came to the conclusion carefully and after full consideration that the name of captain o'shea was the proper name for me to suggest for your consideration hear hear after that conclusion was formed after my recommendation has been made mr lynch came forward he has now retired and the history of those days is a closed book for my mind let me now say a word as to the merits of your candidate of the man who will be your member to morrow night hear hear i shall speak also of his demerits and of the fault which i have had to find with him i shall be perfectly open in my dealing and in my representation of this question to you mr o'shea was returned for the county clare in not as a member of my party so far as i know he has fully both in the letter and the spirit kept the pledges which he gave to the people of clare in hear hear immediately after his return a meeting was held in the city hall in dublin a meeting of the newly appointed irish members for the purpose of choosing a chairman i was proposed as chairman and leader of the party applause mr william shaw was also proposed as chairman and leader of the party groans twenty members of the party voted for william shaw and twenty two members of the party voted for me cheers a voice you are worthy of it mr parnell mr o'shea was one of the twenty two members who voted for me against shaw cheers if he had voted against me and one other member who voted for me had voted against me i would not be the chairman and leader shaw would have been leader and many things that have been done for ireland and her present position i fear would not have been attained some members of the present party voted against me on that occasion i am examining mr o'shea public conduct and record step by step and so far as i have done so i ask you would it not have been very unfair of me if there are men in the present party who voted against me then and who are now members of the party would it not have been unfair of me to have kept back o'shea since he voted for me then hear hear but such an isolated act as that would not have given him any claim apart from other considerations mr o'shea votes have been irreproachable although he has never given a vote to my knowledge with which i could find any fault i have been obliged to condemn him to himself and publicly because during the last parliament he refused to sit in opposition with the irish party hear hear that is the only fault that i have been ever able to find with his public conduct the refusal to sit in opposition but i considered that that was a vital fault a vital blemish and i repeatedly told him during the last parliament that unless he could see his way to promise to sit on our side of the house i could not in the new parliament recommend him to the constituency of clare at the general election and he was not returned to parliament although i supported him in a constituency in liverpool which we could not carry for ourselves and to which i considered he was entitled to have the first claim so far as i could decide the matter but since the general election mr o'shea has given me a promise that he will sit in opposition on our side of the house hear hear and my last objection to him as a candidate has disappeared well now under these circumstances was i to allow him to be persecuted and kept out of parliament no no i know that his return cannot be any public injury cannot be any injury or damage to the national cause i know that his return cannot be any injury to the irish party he was the best man i knew of at the time that i recommended him i have told you that i did not know then of mr lynch claims and having recommended him in my position i was bound not to recede on hair breadth loud cheers one jot but carry through that recommendation to the bitter end to test whether the people of galway and the people of ireland had that confidence in me which i believe they have cheers and which the result of this election will show that they have renewed cheers i have bever led during election long years since my entry into public life i have never led the irish people astray cheers i have never led them into any crooked path no no i have never led the irish party astray cheers when courage was required when it was necessary for the interests of the nation i have shown it cheers and when moderation was required when moderation was necessary and temperate judgment for the interests of the nation i had courage to show it renewed cheers and i never will lead the party or the nation astray cheers until we have gained for you the right to lead and to govern yourselves cheers now countrymen there are several gentlemen who desire to address you i think i have said everything that is necessary for me to say with regard to the candidature of mr o'shea i will only add this word that you must not think because mr lynch has retired it is unnecessary for you to come and vote to morrow all who have votes must come and record their votes for o'shea cheers otherwise the tories who have been desirous of taking advantage of the situation may poll for lynch in order if possible to run him close to the poll of o'shea this is not mr lynch fault mr lynch has acted honourably and fairly towards me and towards the party it is not his fault if the conservatives vote for him to morrow his name cannot be withdrawn from the poll now it must appear on the ballot paper and therefore the tories have the opportunity to try and play the dirty trick groans but you will defeat this dirty trick by giving such a vote in favour of o'shea as will show that you have voted for me and for principle and for ireland a voice parnell forever renewed cheers mr parnell i would have desired to address you also apart from this election upon the great question of the day but i think that in view of the fact that father sheehy is her cheers who will address you some further words i ought not to detain you longer i will only add in conclusion my conviction that the day is very nearly at hand when we shall have gained for ireland the right to make her own laws upon irish soil cheers when that day comes i shall regard my mission as fulfilled i have not entered into this great struggle out of any motives of personal ambition but it is my duty to stand by you until these great measures are completed and gained for you cheers i have come down to galway to stand by you and your course because i believe that any division in our party any weakening of my authority at this moment would have been fatal to that cause that is why i am here and i leave confidently the result in your hands and i feel assured that before many months are gone by you will look back to the proceedings of this day and to your vote to morrow with the satisfaction that results have proved that you have struck a great and successful blow for ireland loud cheers mr parnell on coming forward to speak was received by the crowded audience with an extraordinary demonstration of enthusiasm rivalling in warmth and spontaneity the most enthusiastic welcomes that mr parnell has ever received the entire audience stood up and waving their hats cheered loudly for some time mr parnell said he had never before heard mr kelly lecture and had seldom heard him speak mr o'kelly kept his talents unobtrusive in the background he wished mr o'kelly would come more to the front and would add to those deeds of courage which he had done in the field in mexico in cuba and in the soudan those forensic triumphs which he was perfectly certain it would be in his power to gain to an enormous extent he was glad that they were all united to night cheers and that the symbol of their unity was signalised by the presence of mr lynch in the chair cheers as he had said before on several occasions in this town he trusted before long to welcome mr lynch as a valued colleague into the ranks of the irish party to fight by his side he hoped not for many years or many months in the english house of commons and when they returned to ireland to take part in that work of development of the resources of ireland and the building up of the nation which all so ardently longed to engage in mr lynch would be with them\n",

      "the suppression of the revolt in galway and the acknowledgment of mr parnell authority as home rule dictator has taken a weight of anxiety off the hearts of the nationalists and the parties are praised for their admirable spirit and the sublime spectacle of discipline and obedience to their trusted leader which has been exhibited it is almost a matter of thankfulness according to the national press that the incident occurred as it served to illustrate the unity of the party and the implicit trust reposed in their leader it is not at all improbable that other opportunities of confirming the evidence and causing the same amount of satisfaction will be afforded if the same arbitrary course he followed at o'clock to day mr parnell addressed a meeting of the electors at castlegar about three miles from galway mr parnell in the course of his speech said that had he known that mr lynch was coming forward for the representation of galway he should have cheerfully accepted him cheers but he had it on the authority of mr t p o'connor that the only local candidate mr lynch would not offer himself that he had expressly declined to come forward for the town of galway and that he did not desire and could not be induced under any circumstances to offer himself to the constituency it therefore became necessary to look around for some outside person not connected with the town and the best candidate they could find was captain o'shea hear hear he therefore took upon himself the responsibility of recommending captain o'shea to the constituency a voice your are welcome mr parnell unfortunately owing to a misunderstanding mr lynch was induced to offer himself in opposition to captain o'shea mr lynch had now withdrawn but it would still be necessary for every one to go tot he poll because mr lynch name was still on the ballot paper and the tories and orangemen of galway would go and vote for lynch to a man such a result would not be mr lynch fault because he had done everything that an honourable man could be called upon to do to withdraw from his candidature and advise his friends to vote for captain o'shea with regard to captain o'shea merits as a candidate he was returned in for the county clare mr parnell did not then know him and captain o'shea was not his candidate captain o'shea came up to dublin and attended the meeting of the irish parliamentary party in the city hall then the famous division took place as to who should be the leader of the party captain o'shea voted for him at that crisis in irish history hear hear his leadership was carried by only two votes and it was right for him to remember the service of which captain o'shea then rendered to the cause of ireland as well as to himself personally cheers if captain o'shea and one of the gentlemen had not voted for him on that occasion he should have been deprived of the leadership and many great things which had been done for ireland from that day to this could never have been done the irish parliamentary party to day contained more than one who voted against him on that occasion and if men who voted against him on that occasion were in the party to day why should not captain o'shea be in it who voted in his favour cheers he had declined to support captain o'shea for clare or galway until he had captain o'shea promise that the fault which he had to find with him should not be laid to his charge for the future the only fault he had to find against captain o'shea in regard to his parliamentary action during the last parliament was that he constantly refused to sit on the same side of the house with the irish party in opposition captain o'shea had given him the promise and he would guarantee that the promise would be kept that for the future he would sit in opposition with the irish party in conclusion mr parnell said he had done his duty to the country and to the party in this matter cheers he had never led his country astray and he had always led the party right mr parnell called for three cheers for captain o'shea and the cheers were given cheers were also given for mr parnell mr parnell visited barna about o'clock and saw some principal nationalists there at half past o'clock he addressed a crowd of people from the steps of the railway hotel he was accompanied by several of the roman catholic clergy the rev mr dooley was appointed chairman and in introducing mr parnell he said the people should be directed by him and act according to his dictation for on no occasion had he shown other than a deep interest in the irish people he was their leader and the people of galway would abide by his decision in electing as their representative the man whom he had selected mr parnell who was received with enthusiasm said he felt very proud and very happy for being able to address such a magnificent and such a large meeting of the people of galway the present contest gave him strength and encouragement in the national movement beyond any event which happened in the country for a lengthened period it was a contest forced under very peculiar circumstances and under circumstances well calculated to try their devotion to the popular movement beyond any event which happened in the country for a lengthened period it was a remarkable fact that they stood the test he fully admitted and had observed within the last few days the sacrifice which this constituency had made in order to present the spectacle of discipline to the enemies of the cause and set an example to the irish nation it was the most remarkable instance of unity which irish politics had presented for a long time he would now say a few words with regard to the candidature of mr lynch now withdrawn if he had known when he found it his duty to make the selection for galway that mr lynch intended to seek the representation of the town mr lynch was the man he would have recommended hear hear but it was represented to him that under no circumstances would he accept the position the it was his duty to name a man outside galway and he admired and appreciated the conduct mr lynch exhibited in withdrawing his candidature to allow the gentleman publicly named by him mr parnell to become the member for galway mr lynch had stated that he could not become a candidate and if any different instruction had been conveyed to him mr parnell mr lynch would have gone with him to morrow night from galway as his colleague cheers as he hoped he soon would be when he had to consider this question the very first thing that was before his mind was that mr lynch was not available and he came to the conclusion after full and careful consideration to recommend captain o'shea for the borough the candidature of that gentleman had been accepted the other having withdrawn in his favour and the record of the intervening affair was to his mind a closed book cheers they would permit him to say a few words upon the personal merits of the man who to morrow night would be their representative in doing so he would also point out faults which he had observed in him and for which he had privately condemned him cheers captain o'shea was returned in not as a member of his party he was returned on different pledges and so far as he mr parnell could gather he always kept those pledges immediately after that general election a meeting of the irish members was held in dublin for the purpose of electing a sessional chairman mr shaw was nominated for the position and he mr parnell was also proposed twenty members voted for mr shaw and for him mr o'shea was one of the members who voted for him had he declined to do so with one other member he mr parnell would have been defeated and then their country would not have obtained the many measures since passed on behalf of various interests some gentlemen who are members of the present irish party voted against him on that occasion he was taking the public conduct of captain o'shea step by step and they would agree with him that when others who voted against his leadership were admitted members of the present irish party it would have been very unfair to prevent captain o'shea who had voted for him from getting a seat in parliament hear hear but an isolated turn of the kind would not have justified him mr parnell in recommending him to the constituency of galway as far as he was aware however the votes given by captain o'shea in parliament were irreproachable the only thing for which he found fault with him and he condemned him for it publicly was that he refused to sit in opposition with the irish party he had repeatedly told captain o'shea that that would prevent him being recommended to an irish constituency and that was the reason why he had not recommended him for the county clare at the convention held there to select its representatives he was selected when mr lynch declined to stand and when he mr parnell named him he was bound to stick to him and to fight for him to the bitter end and carry him through cheers he knew that the people of galway would obey him and that ireland would stand by him when during the long years since he had entered irish politics did he advise them wrongly when since he accepted the leadership did he lead them astray when did he lead them on a crooked path cheers and a voice never he believed he showed courage when courage was required and he showed too that he could be moderate when moderation was necessary cheers it was not at all the personnel italics of the two candidates he considered he would not stoop to such a question for both would soon be valued members of the irish party cheers he desired to say a great deal more on the present aspect of their movement but deemed it unnecessary to do so as the patriotic father sheehy was to follow him cheers when that great question was settled he considered his mission fulfilled cheers in conclusion he exhorted the voters to come to the polls in their full strength to vote for o'shea lest the enemy should create a difficulty by voting for lynch\n",

now be withdrawn from the paper it must be on the ballot paper and therefore the tories have the opportunity of playing this dirty trick but you will defeat this dirty trick and you will give your vote not for mr lynch but for o'shea for the purpose of showing that you have voted for me and for ireland cheers i should have desired to have addressed you also apart from this election upon the question of the day but i think that in view of the fact that father sheehy is here and will address you i shall not longer detain you i will only add in conclusion my conviction that the day is very near at hand when we shall have gained for ireland the right to make her own laws on irish soil cheers when that day comes i shall regard my mission as fulfilled i have not entered on this great struggle with any motives of personal ambition but it is my duty to stand by you till these measures are gained for you i have come down to galway to stand by you in your cause for any appearance of division in our party in the weakening of my authority would have been fatal to the cause and that is the reason why i am here and i confidently leave the result in your hands after many a month you will look back to the proceedings of this day with satisfaction for the results which have proved that you have to day struck a great and successful blow for ireland loud applause the dublin express italics says there is still some spark of manly spirit left in the breasts of irish patriots and though trampled on will turn up anew mr parnell arbitrary power will not long bear the strain he has put on it\n",

      "to day mr parnell addressed a crowd of several thousand people from the steps of the railway hotel he was accompanied by a large number of roman catholic clergy mr parnell who was enthusiastically received said he felt very proud and very happy in being able to address such a magnificent and such a vast meeting of the people of galway the present contest gave him strength and encouragement in the national movement beyond any event which had happened in the country for a lengthened period it was a contest forced on under very peculiar circumstances and under circumstances well calculated to try their devotion to the popular movement and to the interests of union cheers it was a remarkable fact that they stood the test a very remarkable fact he fully admitted and had observed within the past few days the sacrifice which this constituency had made in order to present the spectacle of discipline to the enemies of their cause and set an example to the irish nation and it was the most remarkable instance of unity which irish politics have presented for a long time he would now pass on to say a few words in regard to the candidature of mr lynch now withdrawn if he had known when he found it his duty to make the selection for galway that mr lynch intended to seek the representation of the town mr lynch was the man he would have recommended hear hear but it was represented to him that under no circumstances could he accept the position then it was his duty to name a man outside galway for the place he admired and appreciated the conduct he exhibited in withdrawing his candidature to allow the gentleman publicly named by him to become the member for galway mr lynch had stated that he could not allow himself to become the candidate and if any different intimation had been conveyed to him he would have him with him to morrow night from galway as his colleague cheers as he hoped he very soon would be hear hear when he took to considering this question the very first thing that was before his mind was that mr lynch was not available and he came to the conclusion after full and careful consideration to recommend captain o'shea for the borough the candidature of that gentleman had been accepted the other having withdrawn in his favour and the record of the intervening affair was to his mind a closed book cheers they would permit him to say a few words upon the personal merits of the man who to morrow night will be their representative in doing so he would also point out faults which he had observed in him and for which he had privately condemned him applause mr o'shea was returned in not as a member of his party he was returned on different pledges and as far as he could gather he always kept those pledges immediately after that general election a meeting of the irish members was held in dublin for the purpose of electing a sessional chairman mr shaw was nominated for the position and so was he mr parnell also proposed twenty members voted for mr shaw and twenty two for him mr o'shea was one of the members who voted for him mr parnell and if he had declined to do so with one other member he mr parnell would have been defeated and then the country would not have obtained the many measures since passed on behalf of various interests some gentlemen who are members of the present irish party voted against him mr parnell on that occasion he was examining the public conduct of captain o'shea step by step and they would agree with him that when others were admitted members of the present irish party it would have been very unfair to prevent him captain o'shea from getting a seat in parliament hear hear when he voted for the leadership of him mr parnell but an isolated turn of that kind would not have justified him in recommending him to the constituency of galway as far as he mr parnell was aware the votes given in parliament by mr o'shea were irreproachable the only thing for which he mr parnell found fault with him and he did find fault with him and condemn him for it publicly was that he refused to sit in opposition with the irish party he repeatedly told captain o'shea that would prevent him being recommended in an irish constituency and that was the reason why he had not been recommended for the county clare at the convention held there to select its representatives he was selected as he told them when mr lynch had declined to stand and when he mr parnell named him he was bound to stick to him and to fight for him to the bitter end loud cheers and carry him through he knew the people of galway would obey him and that ireland would stand by him when during the eleven long years since he had entered irish politics did he advise them wrongly when since he had accepted leadership did he lead them astray when did he lead them on a crooked path cheers and a voice never he believed he showed courage when courage was required and he showed too that he could be moderate when moderation was necessary cheers it was not at all the personnel italics of the two candidates he would not stoop to such a question for both would soon be valued members of the irish party cheers he desired to say a great deal more on the present aspect of their movement but considered it unnecessary as the patriotic father sheehy was to follow him cheers he might promise them however that they were about to obtain an irish parliament and that until that was obtained he would continue to lead them cheers when that great question was settled he considered his mission fulfilled cheers mr parnell further exhorted the voters to come to the polls in their full strength and vote for o'shea lest the enemy should create a difficulty by voting for lynch\n",

      "mr parnell who was greeted with loud cheers from the irish party on rising said i am glad to find that we have not been disappointed by the lobby rumours which had been circulated for some days past regarding the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and that he has after all like the celebrated but unsuccessful french general who defended paris from the germans got his own plan a laugh and that he did not think at the close of his interesting speech to give us the details of this important plan but i noticed the somewhat discouraging fact that his own valuable eucomiums of his plan elicited no enthusiasm of any kind from any section of the house cheers and counter cheers i noticed that it was not until he had pointed and pleased to hon gentlemen the members of the conservative party that at last some small section of them gave him a cheer or two and that he did succeed in getting some faint applause from a few hon gentlemen belonging to that party irish cheers the conservative party has always been most remarkable in its discipline being sometimes a small party and very often in a minority it is bound to be remarkable undoubtedly in its treatment with respect to the plan of the right hon gentleman the member for midlothian it had in its mind the declaration of the noble lord the member for paddington when he announced in a speech some two or three years since that nothing more should be conceded to the irish nationalists neither in the direction of local self government county boards or anything else of course the rank and file of the conservative party under these circumstances could not have ventured to applaud the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and break away from their allegiance to the noble lord the member for paddington lord r churchill some say the noble lord has been flirting with home rule and a separate irish parliament the apprehension of which has caused so much consternation in the mind of the member for the border burghs i know nothing about these things a laugh and i shall not express any opinion upon them hear but i do think that the right hon gentleman opposite in attempting the comparison which he appeared to draw between the action of earl spencer in remaining in the cabinet and his own action in leaving it to lord spencer disadvantage scarcely stood on fair firm or satisfactory grounds englishmen love a man who fights his own corner to the end lord spencer certainly fought his own corner hear hear he went over to ireland to fight out a battle which was not his and to fight the battle of the irish landlords and he stuck to his post loud irish cheers he faced every danger and every risk both personal and otherwise why the right hon gentleman did something more like running away irish cheers and laughter though the right hon gentleman endeavoured to explain to the house his reason for leaving the cabinet he did not try to explain why he left his position as chief secretary oh oh and cheers if the right hon gentleman was willing to assume that office in ireland it was not a very chivalrous thing for him to take the attitude which to night he says he took with regard to the people generally hear hear the right hon gentleman attempted to prove what terrible things should have been done in ireland when he was chief secretary but for his administration by reading the terms of a motion which i brough forward in i do not desire to go back over old quarrels it generally happens that those who have been defeated in old quarrels like to refer to them irish cheers and laughter but i have nothing to retract what i said then i say now that then there had been the execution and imprisonment of innocent men i believed it then and i believe it now that innocent men had been executed i never accused the right hon gentleman or lord spencer of having believed the same thing knowing that the executed men were innocent but i can scarcely think that the right hon gentleman thinks so now how about the case of bryan kilmartin who was sentenced to years penal servitude an hon member for life mr parnell i am told he was sentenced to penal servitude for life and whose case when brought forward was supported by the noble lord churchill and one or two conservative members including the hon member for blackburn hear hear and that man was found innocent and i believe that this was during the tenure of office held by the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan the right hon gentleman taunts us with the language of the resolution we then brought forward and with the language of the address to irishmen prepared by the hon member for liverpool mr t p o'connor but i consider that these statements were correct and that we had a right to refer to them and because they related to the reign of terror which had then prevailed i do not see how i could have acted otherwise not only to my constituents but out of regard for my public duty as regards law and order of which the right hon gentleman to night poses as the champion hear hear and laughter i should have neglected my duty if i had refrained from bringing these matters under the notice of this house and if the occasion rose now i should act in the same way hear hear when the right hon gentleman used the expressions he had used with regard to my hon friend mr t p o'connor he forgot that it was no less a person the attorney general in the late government who used those words in speaking in ireland the right hon gentleman the late attorney general asserted at a public meeting that the blood of giffin was upon the head of lord spencer irish cheers the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has no censure for that language he does not pick out that language as an example of the great risk of entrusting the care of the lives of the irish people to the future conservative administration under the plans he has furnished to night no he passes that by but certainly no language which was ever used by my hon friends has ever exceeded in gravity the charge i have just put cheers which was made by the late attorney general that the blood of giffen was on the head of lord spencer hear hear the language used in the resolution and in the manifesto of my hon friend was mildness itself in comparison cheers but i hope the question will not be discussed with the heat exhibited by the right hon gentleman i do not wish to go into a justification of our action in the last parliament although i could do so if i chose i could remind the house of the agents used by the right hon gentleman in the upholding of law and order in ireland i could remind them of the result of the trial in french case a man whom the right hon gentleman actually did not shrink from defending in this house but i do not desire to go into these things but will leave history to report that in ever resolution we moved in reference to the administration of the right honourable gentleman during his term of office we were more than justified in what we did he was right in saying this assassination literature is not american literature but if he had really devoted exclusive study to it he would have found that neither is it irish literature if the right hon gentleman were to study the literature of america at the moment he would find that sympathy for a just settlement of the grievances of ireland by the concession of a domestic legislature is shown by all classes whether irish or native born americans hear hear and more especially native born americans are welcoming the efforts of the prime minister in the belief that they will bring peace between england and ireland and more especially between irish americans and england it is a remarkable fact that the great meetings now being held in favour of an irish legislature are principally called together and organised by native born americans by editors and conductors of purely american newspapers we regard the fact that during the last five or six months we have succeeded in entirely gaining the sympathy of the two great political parties in america the democrats and republicans as a good omen for the future the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan spoke about the land purchase bill and he turned to the radical members near him to catch a cheer in his denunciation of the proposal to give money to an irish government but i don't propose to enter into that beyond saying upon this and other matters that it is not out of the mouth of the right hon gentleman that such words should proceed for did not he bring in a bill to buy out the irish landlords hear hear a bill which if he succeeded in passing but fortunately it was added to a long list of failures but if he had succeeded a still more doubtful prospect would have necessitated the additional payment of a very large sum of money towards buying out the irish landlords the very thing he denounces to day with so much eloquence leaving the right hon gentleman i may say as regards his picture of the horrible consequences that may result to ireland and england if any proposal such as that suggested in the bill under discussion were adopted i believe that so far from anything of the kind happening that it contains a peaceful solution of the difficulties between the two countries and why for several reasons why are there such troubles in ireland now why is there talk of separation why does my right hon friend the member for tyrone write what the right hon gentleman considers violent passages in united ireland italics it is because the people are desperate they have nothing to lose hear hear but give them a constitution and they will be proportionately careful not to lose that parnellite cheers every violent speech every criminal action will be so many nails driven into the coffin of that constitution you will have every guarantee you have now and these cannot be weakened very much you will have the forces of the crown which will act just as freely and effectually as they can now no possible adjunct in aid of physical force can be gained by the irish separatists by the provision of such a measure as that explained to us even the control of the constabulary is to be withheld from us until their character has been changed because they are an armed force you have required armed policemen to govern ireland but we are expected to govern it with none at all then too you will have those guarantees of peace and contentment which have always accompanied the concession of measures such as this to the colonies as the surest and best guarantees in addition to those you possess at present hear hear i will pass on to the consideration of the bill my attention to which has been withdrawn by the speech of the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan it is difficult to express a definite or positive opinion with regard to the bill before it has been printed and i should like to reserve a too positive expression of opinion until i have seen the measure which i suppose will be issued on monday but still i think it is right that i should say something about its merits as they have been explained to us by the right hon gentleman the member for midlothian allow me to say sir that i think it will prove to be a happy and fortunate thing both for ireland and england that there was one man living an english statesman with the great power and extraordinary ability of the right hon gentleman to lend his voice to poor helpless ireland on this question loud irish cheers he has devoted his great mind his extraordinary energy to the unravelling of this question it seems to many people that the task may be too large too terrible even for the right hon gentleman i believe the cause of ireland of irish autonomy will gain enormously in a way it never could have otherwise gained by the genius of the right hon gentleman home rule cheers he has drafted his bill and explained it in a speech which from any one else might have been called extraordinary to none of the sons of ireland at any time has ever been given the genius and talent of the right hon gentleman certainly nothing approaching it in these days i thank him therefore for the energy and the time he has devoted to the matter and i believe sincerely in my heart that the result will be that the people of england will recognise as the result of what he has done that he has been to them no less than to the people of ireland a national benefactor cheers but there are undoubtedly great faults and blots in the measure the right hon gentleman has had to meet very strict criticism and a very extraordinary state of affairs he has seen his officers leaving his side one by one and drawing their swords on him as the member for the border burghs has done to night he has had i suppose to shape his measure to meet the tremendous opposition worked against it but there are several points it will be our duty when the measure reaches its committee stage to oppose very strongly and to press for serious modification and amendment the question of the customs has been touched on in giving up the customs that would practically mean giving up to you the control of seven eighths or three fourths of the revenue of ireland it would be absolutely as much in your power as it is now both in regard to the original assignment of the taxes and the receiving of the money the right hon gentleman has indeed explained that if he were to insist on a separate custom house that england could deprive ireland by collecting in ireland the duties on whiskey and tobacco of a year this would be a serious matter and it may be fairly balanced against the control of the customs and the excise but if the prime minister is to claim credit for giving us in lieu of the retention of the customs within the imperial authority he cannot claim credit for it over again and make us pay out of that a year for the irish constabulary over whom we are to have no control whatever at all events for the present then there is the question of contribution to the imperial exchequer i cannot admit and i say it with great deference i cannot admit either the justice or the liberality of the standard of comparison the right hon gentleman has taken this is the most unfavourable standard to us that the right hon gentleman could have chosen of course he is anxious to make the best bargain he can for england and to secure as large a contribution for the imperial treasury as is possible but he should remember that ireland is a very poor country and that with such a small balance as he shows of about a year it will be impossible for ireland to have any credit in the direction of floating loans now we are able to borrow from the treasury large sums of money for various purposes in ireland irish landlords irish tenants local authorities can borrow money all these are very important matters but we shall have to surrender them under the scheme of the right hon gentleman and we shall be left with a budget which will exceed the annual balance by about a year and a budget arrived at on an estimate which necessitates that the consumption of spirits not only in ireland but also in england should continue at its present rate and that the duty should be kept as now as i suppose it will be it is scarcely fair to press us too closely or to insist upon too hard or too close a bargain in regard to this matter of course whatever the sum agreed upon is we must pay it and we will pay it hear hear but it would be most unfortunate if the result of such a standard of comparison as the right hon gentleman has selected should be to impoverish the irish exchequer in that case only would there be any possibility of the danger which the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan has conjured up with regard to an attempted repudiation of the imperial debt an attempt which if made would be entirely unsuccessful because you would have the collection of the excise absolutely in your own hands when you are proposing a great settlement which undoubtedly can only succeed if it is cheerfully accepted by public opinion in ireland if all its important provisions are recognised as just and equitable is it worth while on the part of a rich country like england to drive too hard a bargain i am convinced that we have a much stronger case for the adoption of a standard of 20th or 22nd as the relative wealth of the two countries than the right hon gentleman has for adopting the very unfavourable standard of 15th i have every confidence that when the time comes in committee and when we put our case regarding this most important financial question that the consciences not only of the house of commons but also of the right hon gentleman the prime minister will be touched in this matter and that his zeal for making a good bargain for his own country in the question of imperial contribution has led him into doing an unintentional injustice to ireland then again i think that the question of the royal irish constabulary has been left in a most unsatisfactory state it is unfair to ask us to pay for a force or a large proportion of a force over which we shall have no control whatever but some light might be thrown upon that by a perusal of the bill itself when issued and by proceedings in committee hear hear then comes the vote by orders that had been explained by the right hon gentleman to be that it gave the first order the twenty eight peers the right to hang up any bill for three years three years or a dissolution whichever was the longer thus it would be absolutely within the power of the first order to hang up any measure it pleased and so bring the whole proceedings of the legislature to a deadlock this is a very important point and i say that i have strongly insisted upon a proportional representation of the protestant minority as would give them representation according to their numerical strength and as far as the first order was concerned it might be very well with a view to preventing any rash hasty ill considered legislation and with that i cordially agree hear hear but so far as it acts or could be made to act as an obstruction to legislation or as a means of bringing about a political deadlock on the part of a body of members who could scarcely be said to be representative i think it should be moderated so as to make it impossible hear hear as regards the measure itself the prime minister has truly said that it ought not to proceed unless it is cheerfully welcomed not only by the irish members but the irish people i quite agree with that i am convinced that if our views are fairly met in committee with regard to the defects to which i have alluded that the effects of its working will be to agreeably disappoint the right hon member for the border burghs and that this proposal will be cheerfully accepted by the irish people and by ireland representatives as a solution of the long standing dispute between the two countries and that it will be to the prosperity and peace of ireland and to the satisfaction of england cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was greeted with loud cheers from the irish party on rising said i am glad to find that we have not been disappointed by the lobby rumours which had been circulated for some days past regarding the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and that he has after all like the celebrated but unsuccessful french general who defended paris from the germans got his own plan a laugh and that he did not think fit at the close of his interesting speech to give us the details of this important plan but i notice the somewhat discouraging fact that his own valuable encomiums of his plan elicited no enthusiasm of any kind from any section of the house cheers and counter cheers i noticed that it was not until he had pointed and pleaded to hon gentlemen the members of the conservative party that at last some small section of them gave a cheer or two and that he did succeed in getting some faint applause from a few hon gentlemen belonging to that party irish cheers the conservative party has always been most remarkable in its discipline being sometimes a small party and very often in a minority it is bound to be remarkable undoubtedly in its treatment with respect to the plan of the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian it had in its mind the declaration of the noble lord the member for paddington when he announced in a speech some two or three years since that nothing more should be conceded to the irish nationalists neither in the direction of local self government county boards nor anything else of course the rank and file of the conservative party under these circumstances could not have ventured to applaud the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and break away from their allegiance to the noble lord the member for paddington lord r churchill some say the noble lord has been flirting with home rule and a separate irish parliament the apprehension of which has caused so much consternation in the mind of the member for the border burghs i know nothing about those things a laugh and i shall not express any opinion upon it hear hear but i do think that the right hon gentleman opposite in attempting the comparison which he appeared to draw between the action of the earl spencer in remaining in the cabinet and his own action in leaving it to lord spencer disadvantage scarcely stood on fine firm or satisfactory ground englishmen loves a man who fights his own corner to the end lord spencer certainly fought his own corner hear hear he went over to ireland to fight out a battle which was not his and to fight the battle of the irish landlords and he stuck to his post loud irish cheers he faced every danger and risk both personal and otherwise why the right hon gentleman did something more like running away irish cheers and laughter though the right hon gentleman endeavoured to explain to the house his reasons for leaving the cabinet he did not try to explain why he left his position as chief secretary oh oh and cheers if the right hon gentleman was willing to assume that office in ireland it was not a very chivalrous thing for him to take the attitude which to night he says he took with regard to the people generally hear hear the right hon gentleman attempted to prove what terrible things should have been done in ireland when he was chief secretary but for his administration by reading the terms of a motion which i brought forward in i do not desire to go back over old quarrels it generally happens that those who have been defeated in old quarrels like to refer to them irish cheers and laughter but of this distant and unhappy time i have no thing to retract what i said then i say now that there had been execution and imprisonment of innocent men i believed it then and i believe it now that innocent men had been executed i never accused the right hon gentleman or lord spencer of having believed the same thing knowing that the executed men were innocent but i can scarcely think that the right hon gentleman thinks so now how about the case of bryan kilmartin who was sentenced to years penal servitude an hon member for life i am told he was sentenced to penal servitude for life and whose case when brought forward was supported by the noble lord churchill and one or two conservative members including the hon member for blackburn hear hear and that man was found innocent and i believe that this was during the tenure of the office then held by the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan the right hon gentleman taunts us with the language of the resolution we then brought forward and with the language of the address to irishmen prepared by the hon member for liverpool mr t p o'connor but i consider that these statements were correct and that we had a right to refer to them and because they related to the reign of terror which had then prevailed i do not see how i could have acted otherwise not only to my constituents but out of regard for my public duty as regards law and order of which the right hon gentleman to night poses as champion hear hear and laughter i should have neglected my duty if i had refrained from bringing these matters under the notice of this house and if the occasion arose now i should act in the same way hear hear when the right hon gentleman used the expressions he had used with regard to my hon friend mr t p o'connor he forgot that he was no less a person than the attorney general in the late government who used these words in speaking in ireland the right hon gentleman asserted at a public meeting that the blood of giffen was upon the head of lord spencer irish cheers the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has no censure for that language he does not pick out that language as an example of the great risk of intrusting the care of the lives of the irish people to future conservative administrations under the plans he has formulated to night no he passes that by but certainly no language which was ever used by my hon friends ever exceeded in gravity the charge i have just put cheers which was made by the late attorney general that the blood of giffen was on the head of lord spencer hear hear the language used in the resolution and in the manifesto of my right hon friend was mildness itself in comparison cheers but i hope the question will not be discussed with the heat exhibited by the right hon gentleman i do not wish to go into a justification of our action in the last parliament although i could do so if i chose i could remind the house of the agents used by the right hon gentleman in the upholding of law and order in ireland i could remind them of the result of the trial in french case a man whom the right hon gentleman actually did not shrink from defending in this house but i do not desire to go into these things but will leave history to record that in every resolution we moved with reference to the administration of the right hon gentleman during his term of office we were more than justified in what we did he was right in saying this assassination literature is not american literature but if he had really devoted exclusive study to it he would have found that neither is it irish literature if the right hon gentleman were to study the literature of america at this moment he would find that sympathy for a just settlement of the grievances of ireland by the concession of a domestic legislature is shown by all classes whether irish or native born americans hear hear and more especially native born americans are welcoming the efforts of the prime minister in the belief that he will bring peace between england and ireland and more especially between irish americans and england it is a remarkable fact that the great meetings now being held in favour of an irish legislature are mostly called together and organised by native born americans by editors and conductors of purely american newspapers we regard the fact that during the last five or six months we have succeeded in entirely gaining the sympathy of the two great political parties in america the democrats and republicans as a good omen for the future the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan spoke about the land purchase bill and he turned to the radical members near him to catch a cheer in his denunciation of the proposal to give money to an irish parliament but i do not propose to enter into that beyond saying upon this and other matters that it is not out of the mouth of the right hon gentleman that such words should proceed for did not he under the late government bring in a bill to buy out the irish landlords hear hear a bill which if he had succeeded in passing but fortunately it was added to a long list of his failure but if he had succeeded in passing it and if it had been successful a still more doubtful prospect it would have necessitated the additional payment of a very large sum of money towards buying out irish landlords the very thing he denounced to day with so much eloquence leaving the right hon gentleman i may say as regard his picture of the horrible consequences that may result to ireland and england if any proposal such as that suggested in the bill under discussion were adopted i believe that so far from anything of the kind happening that it contains a peaceful solution of difficulties between the two countries and why for several reasons why are there such troubles in ireland now why is there talk of separation why does not my hon friend the member for tyrone write what he considers violent passages in united ireland italics it is because the people are desperate they have nothing to lose hear hear but give them a constitution and they will be proportionately careful not to lose that parnellite cheers every violent speech every criminal action will be so many nails driven in the coffin of that constitution you will have every guarantee you have now and those cannot be weakened very much you will have the forces of the crown which will act just as freely and effectively as they can now no possible adjunct in aid of physical force can be gained by the irish separatists by the provisions of such a measure as that explained to us even the control of the constabulary is to be withheld from us until their character has been changed because they are an armed force you have required armed policemen to govern ireland but we are expected to govern it with none at all then too you will have those guarantees of peace and contentment which have always accompanied measures such as this to the colonies as the surest and best guarantee in addition to those you possess at present hear hear i will pass on to the consideration of the bill my attention to which has been withdrawn by the speech of the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan it is difficult to express a definite or positive opinion with regard to the bill before it has been printed and i should like to reserve a too positive expression of opinion until i have seen the measure which i suppose will be issued on monday but i still think it is right that i should say something about its merits as they have been explained to us by the right hon gentleman the member for midlothian allow me to say sir that i think it will prove to be a happy and fortunate thing both for ireland and england that there was one man living an english statesman with the great power and extraordinary ability of the right honourable gentleman to lend his voice to poor helpless ireland on this question loud irish cheers he has devoted his great mind his extraordinary energy to the unravelling of this question it seems to many people that the task may be too large too terrible even for the right hon gentleman i believe it will not be so home rule cheers but whatever may be the fate of the measure i believe the case of ireland of irish autonomy will gain enormously in a way it never could have otherwise gained by the genius of the right hon gentleman home rule cheers he has draughted his bill and explained it in a speech which from any one else might have been called extraordinary to none of the sons of ireland at any time has ever been given the genius and talent of the right hon gentleman certainly nothing approaching it in these days i thank him therefore for the energy and the time he has devoted to this matter and i believe sincerely in my heart that the result will be that the people of england will recognise as the result of what he has done that he has been to them no less than to the people of ireland a national benefactor cheers but there are undoubtedly great faults and blots in the measure the right hon gentleman has had to meet very great criticism and a very extraordinary state of affairs he has seen his officers leaving his side one by one and drawing their swords on him as the member for the border burghs has done to night he has had i suppose to shape his measure to meet the tremendous opposition evoked against it but there are several points it will be our duty when the measure reaches its committee stage to oppose very strongly and to press for serious modification and amendment the question of the customs has been touched on in giving up the customs that would practically mean giving up to you the control of six eighths or three fourths of the revenue of ireland it would be absolutely as much in your power as it is now both in regard to the original assignment of the taxes and the receiving of the money the right hon gentleman has indeed explained that if we were to insist on a separate custom house england could deprive ireland by collecting in england the duties on whiskey and tobacco of in the extension of customs within the imperial authority he cannot claim credit for it over again and make us pay out of that ooo ooo a year for the control whatever at all events for the present then there is the question of contribution to the imperial exchequer i cannot admit and i say it with great deference i cannot admit either the justice or the liberality of the standard of comparison the right hon gentleman has set up this is the most unfavourable standard to us that the right hon gentleman could have chosen of course he is anxious to make the best bargain he can for england and to secure as large a contribution for the imperial treasury as is possible but he should remember that ireland is a very poor country and that with such a small balance as he shows of about a year it would be absolutely impossible for ireland to have any credit in the direction of floatng loans now we are able to borrow from the treasury large sums of money for various irish purposes in ireland irish landlords irish tenants local authorities can borrow money all these are very important matters but we shall have to surrender them under the scheme of the right hon gentleman and we shall be left with a budget which will exceed the annual balance by about a year and a budget arrived at on an estimate which necessitates that the consumption of spirits not only in ireland but also in england should continue at its present rate and that the duty should be kept as now as i suppose it will be it is scarcely fair to press us too closely or to insist upon too hard or too close a bargain in regard to this matter of course whatever the sum agreed upon is we must pay it and we will pay it hear hear but it would be most unfortunate if the result of such a standard of comparison as the right hon gentleman has selected should be to impoverish the irish exchequer in that case only would there be any possibility of the danger which the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan has augured with regard to an attempted repudiation of the imperial debt an attempt which if made would have the collection of the excise absolutely in your own hands when you are proposing a great settlement which admittedly can only succeed if it is cheerfully accepted by public opinion in ireland if all its important provisions are recognised as just and equitable is it worth while on the part of a rich country like england to drive too hard a bargain i am convinced that we have a much stronger claim for the adoption of a standard of 20th or 22nd as the relative wealth of the two countries than the right honourable gentleman has for adopting the very unfavourable standard of 15th i have every confidence that when the time comes in committee and when we put our case regarding this most important financial question that the consciences not only of the house of commons but of the right hon gentleman the prime minister will be touched in this matter and that he will see that his zeal for making a good bargain for his own country in the question of imperial contribution has led him into doing an unintentional injustice to ireland then again i think that the question of the royal irish constabulary has been left in a most unsatisfactory state it is unfair to ask us to pay for a force or a large proportion of a force over which we shall have no control whatever but some light may be thrown upon that by a perusal of the bill itself when issued and by proceedings in committee

guarantees in addition to those you possess at present hear hear i will pass on to the consideration of the bill my attention to which has been withdrawn by the speech of the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan it is difficult to express a definite or positive opinion with regard to the bill before it has been printed and i should like to reserve a too positive expression of opinion until i have seen the measure which i suppose will be issued on monday but still i think it is right that i should say something about its merits as they have been explained to us by the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian allow me to say sir that i think it will prove to be a happy and fortunate thing both for ireland and england that there was one man living an english statesman with the great power and extraordinary ability of the right hon gentleman to lend his voice to poor helpless ireland on this question loud irish cheers he has devoted his great mind his extraordinary energy to the unravelling of this question it seems to many people that the task may be too large too terrible even for the right hon gentleman i believe it will not be so home rule cheers but whatever may be the fate of the measure i believe the cause of ireland of irish autonomy will gain enormously in a way it never could have otherwise gained by the genius of the right hon gentleman home rule cheers he had drafted his bill and explained it in a speech which from anyone else might have been called extraordinary to none of the sons of ireland at any time has ever been given the genius and talent of the right hon gentleman certainly nothing approaching it in these days and i thanked him therefore for the energy and the time he has devoted to this matter and i believe sincerely in my heart that the result will be that the people of england will recognise as the result of what he has done that he has been to them no less than to the people of ireland a national benefactor cheers but there are undoubtedly great faults and blots in the measure the right hon gentleman has had to meet a very critical and extraordinary state of affairs he has seen his officers leaving his side one by one and drawing their swords on him as the member for the border burghs has done to night he has had i suppose to shape his measure to meet the tremendous opposition worked against it but there are several points which it will be our duty when the measure reaches its committee stage to oppose very strongly and to press for serious modification and amendment the question of the customs has been touched on in giving up the customs that would practically mean giving up to you the control of six eighths or three fourths of the revenue of ireland it would be absolutely as much in your power as it is now both in regard to the original assignment of the taxes and the receiving of the money the right hon gentleman has indeed explained that if we were to insist on separate customs that england could deprive ireland by collecting in ireland the duties on whiskey and tobacco of a year this would be a serious matter and it may be fairly balanced against the control of the customs and the excise but if the prime minister is to claim credit for giving us of the retention of customs within the imperial authority he cannot claim credit for it over again and make us pay out of that a year for the irish constabulary over whom we are to have no control whatever at all events for the present then there is the question of contribution to the imperial exchequer i cannot admit and i say it with great deference i cannot admit either the justice or the liberality of the standard of comparison the right hon gentleman could have chosen of course he is anxious to make the best bargain he can for england and to secure as large a contribution for the imperial treasury as is possible but he should remember that ireland is a very poor country and that will such a small balance as he shows of about a year it will be absolutely impossible for ireland to have any credit in the direction of floating loans now we are able to borrow from the treasury large sums of money for various purposes in ireland irish landlords irish tenants local authorities can borrow money all these are very important matters but we shall have to surrender them under the scheme of the right hon gentleman and we shall be left with a budget which will exceed the annual balance by about a year and a budget arrived at on an estimate which necessitates that the consumption of spirits not only in ireland but also in england should continue at its present rate and that the duty should be kept as now as i suppose it will be it is scarcely fair to press us too closely or to insist upon too hard or too close a bargain in regard to this matter of course whatever the sum agreed upon is we must pay it and we will pay it hear hear but it would be most unfortunate if the result of such a standard of comparison as the right hon gentleman has selected should be to impoverish the irish exchequer in that case only would there be any possibility of the danger which the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan has augured up with regard to an attempted repudiation of the imperial debt an attempt which if made would be entirely unsuccessful because you would have the collection of the excise absolutely in your own hands when you are proposing a great settlement which admittedly can only succeed if it is cheerfully accepted by public opinion in ireland if all its important provisions are recognised as just and equitable is it worth while on the part of a rich country like england to drive too hard a bargain i am convinced that we have a much stronger case for the adoption of a standard of 20th or 22nd as the relative wealth of the two countries than the right hon gentleman has for adopting the very unfavourable standard of 15th i have every confidence that when the time comes in committee and when we put our case regarding this most important financial question that the consciences not only of the house of commons but also of the right hon gentleman the prime minister will be touched in this matter and that he will see that his zeal for making a good bargain for his own country in the question of imperial contribution has led him into doing an unintentional injustice to ireland then again i think that the question of the royal irish constabulary has been left in a most unsatisfactory state it is unfair to ask us to pay for a force or a large proportion of a force over which we shall have no control whatever but some light might be thrown upon that by a perusal of the bill itself when issued and by proceedings in committee hear hear then came the vote by orders that had been explained by the right hon gentleman to be that it gave the first order the peers the right to hand up any bill for three years three years or a dissolution whichever was the longer this it would be absolutely within the power of the first order to hang up any measure it pleased and so bring the whole proceedings of the legislature to a deadlock this is a very important point and i say that i have strongly insisted upon such a proposition proportional representation of the protestant minority as would give them representation according to their numerical strength and as far as the first order is concerned it might be very well with a view to preventing any rash hasty ill considered legislation and with that i cordially agree hear hear but so far as it acts or could be made to act as an obstruction to legislation or as a means of bringing about a political deadlock on the part of a body of members who could scarcely be said to be representative i think it should be moderated so as to make that impossible hear hear as regards the measure itself the prime minister has truly said that it ought not to proceed unless it is cheerfully welcomed not only by the irish members but by the irish people i quite agree with that i am convinced that if our views were fairly met in committee with regard to the defects to which i have alluded the effects of its working will be to agreeably disappoint the right hon member for the border burghs and that this proposal will be cheerfully accepted by the irish people and by her representatives as a solution of the long standing dispute between the two countries and that it will be to the prosperity and peace of ireland and to the satisfaction of england cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was greeted with loud cheers from the irish party on rising said i am glad to find that we have not been disappointed by the lobby rumours which had been circulated for some days past regarding the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and that he has after all like the celebrated but unsuccessful french general who defended paris from the germans got his own plan a laugh and that he did not think at the close of his interesting speech to give us the details of this important plan but i noticed the somewhat discouraging fact that his own valuable encomiums of his plan elicited no enthusiasm of any kind from any section of the house cheers and counter cheers i noticed that it was not until he had pointed and pleaded to hon gentlemen the members of the conservative party that some small section of them gave him a cheer or two and that he did succeed in getting some faint applause from a few hon gentlemen belonging to that party irish cheers the conservative party has always been most remarkable in its discipline being sometimes a small party and very often in a minority it is bound to be remarkable undoubtedly in its treatment with respect to the plan of the right hon gentleman the member for midlothian it had in its mind the declaration of the noble lord the member for paddington when he announced in a speech some two or three years since that nothing more should be conceded to the irish nationalists neither in the direction of local self government county boards or anything else of course the rank and file of the conservative party under these circumstances could not have ventured to applaud the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and break away from the allegiance to the noble lord the member for paddington lord r churchill some say the noble lord has been flirting with home rule and a separate irish parliament the apprehension of which had caused so much consternation in the mind of the member for the border borough i know nothing about these things a laugh and i shall not express any opinion upon it hear hear but i do think that the right hon gentleman opposite in attempting the comparison which he appeared to draw between the action of earl spencer in remaining in the cabinet and his own action in leaving it to lord spencer disadvantage scarcely stood on firm or satisfactory ground englishmen love a man who fights his own corner hear hear he went over to ireland to fight out a battle which was not his and to fight the battle of the irish landlords and he stuck to his post loud irish cheers he faced every danger and every risk both personal and otherwise why the right hon gentleman endeavoured to explain to the house his reason for leaving the cabinet he did not try to explain why he left his position as chief secretary oh oh and cheers if the right hon gentleman was willing to assume that office in ireland it was not a very chivalrous thing for him to take the attitude which to night he took with regard to the people generally hear hear the right hon gentleman attempted to prove what terrible things would have been done in ireland when he was chief secretary but for his administration by reading the terms of a motion which i brought forward in i do not desire to go back over old quarrels it generally happens that those who have been defeated in old quarrels like to refer to them irish cheers and laughter but of that distant and unhappy time i have nothing to retract what i said then i say now that there had been the execution and imprisonment of innocent men had been executed i never accused the right hon gentleman or lord spencer of having believed the same thing knowing that the executed men were innocent but i can scarcely think that the right hon gentleman thinks so now how about the case of bryan kilmartin who was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude an hon member for life i am told he was sentenced to penal servitude for life and whose case when brought forward was supported by the noble lord churchill and one or two conservative members including the hon member for blackburn hear hear that man was found innocent and i believe that this was during the tenure of office then held by the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan the right hon gentleman taunts us with the language of the resolution we then brought forward and with the language of the address to irishmen prepared by the hon member for liverpool mr t p o'connor but i consider that these statements were correct and that we had a right to refer to them and because they related to the reign of terror which had then prevailed i do not see how i could have acted otherwise not only to my constituents but out of regard for my public duty as regards law and order of which the right hon gentleman poses as champion hear hear and laughter i should have neglected my duty if i had refrained from bringing these matters under the notice of this house and if the occasion arose now i should act in the same way hear hear when the right hon gentleman used the expression he had used with regard to my hon friend mr t p o'connor he forgot that he was no less a person than the attorney general in the late government who used these words in speaking in ireland the right hon gentleman the late attorney general asserted at a public meeting that the blood of giffen was upon the head of lord spencer irish cheers the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has no censure for that language he does not pick out that language as an example of the great risk of introducing the care of the lives of the irish people to the future conservative administrations under the plans he has formulated to night no he passes that by but certainly no language which was ever used by my hon friends has ever exceeded in gravity the charge i have just put cheers which was made by the late attorney that the blood of giffen was on the head of lord spencer hear hear the language was used in the resolution and in the manifesto of my right hon friend was mildness itself in comparison cheers but i hope the question will not be discussed with the heat exhibited by the right hon gentleman i do not wish to go into a justification of our action in the last parliament although i could do so if i chose i could remind the house of the agents used by the right hon gentleman in the upholding of law and order in ireland i could remind them of the result of the trial in french case a man whom the right hon gentleman actually did not shriek from defending in this house but i do not desire to go into these things but will leave history to report that in every resolution we moved with reference to the administration of the right hon gentleman during his term of office we were more than justified in what we did he was right in saying this assassination literature is not american literature but if he had really devoted exclusive study to it he would have found that neither is it irish literature if the right hon gentleman were to study the literature of america at the moment he would find that sympathy for a just settlement of the grievance of ireland by the concession of a domestic legislature is shown by all classes whether irish or native born americans hear hear and more especially native born americans are welcoming the efforts of the prime minister in the belief that it will bring peace between england and ireland and more especially between irish americans and england it is a remarkable fact that the great meetings now being held in favour of an irish legislature are called together and organised by native born americans by editors and conductors of purely american newspapers we regard the fact that during the last five or six months we have succeeded in intirely sic gaining the sympathy of the two great political in america the democrats and republicans as a good omen for the future the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan spoke about the land purchase bill and he turned up to the radical members near him to catch a cheer in his denunciation of the proposal to give money to an irish government but i don't propose to enter into that beyond saying upon this and other matters that it is not out of the mouth of the right hon gentleman that such words should proceed for did not he under the late administration bring in a bill to buy out the irish landlords hear hear a bill which if he had succeeded in passing but fortunately it was added to a long list of failures but if he had succeeded in passing it and if it had been successful a still more doubtful prospect would have necessitated the additional payment of a very large sum of money towards buying our irish landlords the very thing he denounces to day with so much eloquence leaving the right hon gentleman i may say as regards his picture of the horrible consequences that may result to ireland and england if any proposal such as that suggestion in the bill under discussion was adopted i believe that so far from anything of the kind happening it contains a peaceful solution of difficulties between the two countries and why for several reasons why are there such troubles in ireland now why is there talk of separation why does not my hon friend the member for tyrone write what he considers violent passages in united ireland it is because the people are desperate they have nothing to lose hear hear but give them a constitution and they will be proportionately careful not to lose that parnellite cheers every violent speech every criminal action will be so many nails driven in the coffin of that constitution you will have every guarantee you have now and those cannot be weakened very much you will have the forces of the crown which will act just as freely and effectively as they can now no possible adjunct in aid of physical force can be gained by the irish separatists by the provisions of such a measure as that explained to us even the control of the constabulary is to be withheld from us until their character has been changed because they are an armed force you have required armed policemen to govern ireland but we are expected to govern it with none at all then too you will have those guarantees of peace and contentment which have always accompanied the concession of measures such as this to the

was i not right at the very height of this reign of terror in ireland to state what i did publicly i did not see how with any sort of consideration for my public duty as regards questions of law and order in ireland of which the right hon gentleman has constituted himself the sole champion to night i could refrain from bringing these matters under the attention of the house that in the captain but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy while the right hon gentleman bases such weighty arguments on the resolution to which he refers and the expressions in the manifesto of my hon friend he passes over the language which has been used since then in ireland by a very prominent member of the late administration a man who was specially charged with the maintenance of law and order in ireland no less a personage than the attorney general of the late government speaking at a public meeting in that country the late attorney general asserted that the blood of giffen was on

relations of england and ireland is to be discussed with the heat i will not say ill temper shown by the right hon gentleman that will greatly increase the difficulty of discussion but i hope his example will not be imitated i do not wish to go into a justification of our action in the last parliament but i could do so if i wished i could remind the house of the agents used by the right hon

defending in this house i do not desire to go into these things but i believe history will record that in every resolution which we moved with reference to the administration of the right hon gentleman we were more than amply justified the right hon gentleman has spoke of assassination literature and would lead the house to believe that american sympathy for the irish cause is confined to the supporters of this assassination literature he has spoken of mr ford all i can say with regard to him is that he has been constantly denouncing myself and my policy during the last five years the right hon gentleman is right in saying that this assassination literature is no american literature and if he has studied it attentively he will also see that it is not irish literature either if he were to study the literature of america now he would find that the sympthy sic with the just settlement of the claims of ireland by the concession of a domestic legislature is shared by all classes in

summoned and organized by native born americans and by the editors and conductors of the purely american newspapers and we regard the fact that during the last five or six months we have succeeded in entirely gaining the sympathy of the two great american political parties the democratic and the republican as an omen of great hope for the future of our cause the right hon gentleman in speaking about the land purchase bill turned to the radical members sitting below him in order to catch a cheer or two in his denunciation of the proposal to give money to irish landlords now sir i do not propose to go into the merits of this question but regarding that matter just as i regard the other matter i will only say that it is not out of the mouth of the right hon gentleman that such unkind words should proceed because he himself brought in a bill in the last parliament as a member of the government for buying out irish landlords home rule cheers and laughter if that bill had succeeded in passing and unfortunately it was added to the long list of failures laughter and if it had been successful which was a still more doubtful prospect it would have necessitated an additional payment of a very large sum of money for the purpose of buying out the irish landlords the very thing he denounced to night with so much eloquence in order if he possibly could to throw some discredit on the present scheme perhaps i might say in leaving the right hon gentleman as regards his picture of the horrible consequences which will result to ireland and to england if any such proposal as that suggested in the bill under discussion were adopted the consequences of physical force of rebellion and of separation i believe so far from anything of the kind happening that your guarantee of a peaceful solution between the two countries will be enormously increased home rule cheers why do i say that they will be enormously increased whey will be increased for several reasons why is there trouble in ireland now why do the people talk about separation why does my hon friend the member for tyrone write what the right hon gentleman considers violent passages in united ireland it is because the people are desperate and have nothing to lose but give them a constitution and they will be proportionately careful not to lose that every violent speech every criminal action will be so many nails driven into the coffin of their constitution you will have every guarantee you possess now these cannot be weakened the forces of the crown will act just as freely and effectively as they do know even the control of the constabulary is to be withheld from us until their character has been altered because they are an armed force although it has been impossible or very difficult for england to govern ireland without armed policemen we are expected to govern ireland without any policemen at all laughter certainly no additional strength can be added to the physical force argument and you will have those guarantees of peace and contentment which have always accompanied in the experience which we have had the concessions of those measures to the colonies and to the countries of europe you will have these as your surest and best guarantees in addition to those you possess at present home rule cheers i will now pass on to the measure from the consideration of which my attention was withdrawn by the speech of the right hon gentleman i desire to speak very briefly it is difficult to express a definite and positive expression of opinion until i have seen the measure placed completely before us still however i think it is right that i should say something about the merits of the bill as they have been expressed to us by the prime minister hear hear allow me to say that i think it will prove a happy and fortunate thing both for ireland and england that there was one man living one english statesman living with the great power and the extraordinary ability of the right hon gentleman to lend his voice on behalf of poor helpless ireland on this question home rule cheers he had devoted his great mind his extraordinary energy to the unravelling of this question and to the construction of this bill it seemed to many people that the task might prove too large too terrible even for him i believe it will not be so home rule cheers but whatever may be the fate of the bill the cause of ireland the cause of irish autonomy will enormously gain by the genius of the right hon gentleman hear hear he has drafted this bill he has explained it to the house in a speech of extraordinary eloquence to ireland i suppose to none of the sons of ireland at any time has there ever been given the genius and talent of the right hon gentleman certainly nothing approaching to it in these days i thank therefore the right hon gentleman for the energy and the time he has devoted to this matter and i believe sincerely in my heart that the effect of it will be that the people of england will recognize as the result of what he has done no less than the people of ireland that he has been to them a national benefactor cheers but there are undoubtedly great faults and blots in the measure the right hon gentleman has had to meet very hostile criticism and a very extraordinary state of affairs he has seen his officers leaving his side one by one and drawing their swords as the right hon member for the border burghs did to night against him hear hear and he has had i suppose to shape his measure to meet the tremendous opposition which has been invoked but there are several points which it will be our duty when the measure reaches its committee stage to oppose very strongly and to press for their serious modification and amendment the question of the has been touched upon in giving up the customs we should practically give to you the whole control of six eighths or three fourths of the revenues of ireland it would be absolutely as much within your power as it is now both as regards the original assessment of the taxes and the receiving of the money the right hon gentleman has explained to us that if we were to insist on separate custom houses england by collecting the duties on whisky and tobacco in her own custom houses gives a year this of course is a very serious consideration and it may be very fairly balanced against the cession of the control of the customs and excise but at the same time if the right hon gentleman the prime minister is to take credit for giving us that as a consequence of the retention of the custom houses and the collection of the revenue within the imperial authority i do not think he is also entitled to claim credit for it a second time and make us pay out of the a million for the irish constabulary over whom we are not to have any sort of control at all at least at present then there is the question of the contribution to the imperial expenditure i cannot admit i say it with great deference either the justice or the liberality of the standard of comparison which he has taken it appears to be the amount of property which comes under assessment regarding the payment of legacy and sucession sic duties that is the most unfavourable standard for us that he could have chosen of course i understand that he was anxious to make the best bargain he could for england and to secure as large a contribution for the imperial treasury as possible but he should also remember that ireland is a very poor country and that with such a small balance as he showed on the budget of a year it will be impossible for floating loans irish landlords now can borrow money for the improvement of their estates irish tenants can borrow money for improving their farms local bodies can borrow money for sanitary purposes within their jurisdiction all these are very important matters but we shall have to surrender all these under the scheme of the right hon gentleman hear hear and we shall be left with a budget which only exceeds the annual balance by about a year and a budget arrived at on an estimate which necessitates that the consumption of spirits not only in ireland but also in england should continue at its present rate and of course that the duty should be kept as it is now probably one of the first things that will happen in ireland under an irish legislature will be the imposition of restrictions in regard to the sale of strong drink on sundays as well as on other days and certainly we must anticipate and i should hope we can anticipate a considerable reduction in the amount of the revenue derived from those duties it is therefore scarcely fair i think to press us too closely or to insist on driving too hard a bargain in this matter if the sum is agreed upon of course we must pay it we will pay it hear hear but it would be most unfortunate if the right hon gentleman selected such a standard of comparison as would lead him to adopt the proportion of one fifteenth in that case only would there be any possibility of the danger which the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has conjured up as to the repudiation of the imperial debt an attempt which if made would be entirely unsuccessful because you have the collection of the customs and the excise absolutely in your own hands when you are proposing a great settlement which can only succeed if freely accepted by public opinion in ireland is it worth while for a rich country like england on the question of one way or the other to drive too hard a bargain i do not want to go into the question to night but after reading the article by mr giffen which has attracted so much attention and a communication in the times of this morning from a gentleman who evidently knows what he is writing about i think that it is clear that one twentieth is a far better standard of the relative share of the two countries than that most unfortunate standard of one fifteenth which the right hon gentleman has adopted we could show several standards much more favourable to us based upon the things consumed in ireland and which will show that ireland is a very much poorer country in comparison with england than is expressed by the proportion which the right hon gentleman has selected i have every confidence that when the time comes when this bill is in committee and when we put forward our case the conscience not only of the house of commons but of the right hon gentleman the prime minister will be touched in regard to this matter and that he will see that his zeal for making a good bargain for his own country has led him into doing an unintentional injustice to ireland in this question of the contribution towards the imperial expenditure i think also that the question of the royal irish constabulary has been left in a most unsatisfactory condition i think that it is most unfair to ask us to pay for a force or a large proportion of it over which we have no control whatever this however is also a matter upon which we shall have more light when we see the bill of the right hon gentleman there is another important point to which i wish to allude namely with regard to vote by order as explained by the right hon gentleman the first order elected by a fancy franchise is given the right of hanging up any bill for three years i understood the words of the right hon gentleman to be these three years or until a dissolution whichever is the longer i think that that would indicate three years as the minimum italics of time during which they could hang up a bill and if a dissolution did not take place before three years the bill would be hung up for a still longer period i should be glad if i were mistaken on this point it is possible that i may be but in any case whatever the period might be it would be absolutely within the power of the first order in which from the nature of the case the popular party in ireland could not obtain many representatives to hang up any measure they pleased and so to bring the proceedings of the legislature to a deadlock i am one of those who have always insisted that a due proportion of representation should be given to the protestant minority in ireland and anything also which would tend to prevent rash hasty ill considered or revolutionary legislation i cordially welcome but as far as the measure leads to obstruction more or less permanent to legislation and the means of bringing about a deadlock on the part of a body of members who cannot be said to be representative i think that it ought to be modified so as to render such delay as that absolutely impossible hear hear as regards the measure itself the prime minister has truly said that it ought not to proceed unless it is cheerfully welcomed not only by the irish members but by the irish people i quite agree in that proposition and i am convinced that if our views are fairly met the result of this bill will be to agreeably disappoint the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and all those who think with him that it will be cheerfully accepted by the irish people as a solution of the long standing dispute between the two countries and that it will lead to the prosperity and peace of ireland and the satisfaction of england cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with enthusiastic cheers from the irish benches said mr speaker i am glad to find that we have not been disappointed by the lobby rumours which have been circulated for some days past regarding the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and that he is after all like the celebrated but unsuccessful french general who defended paris from the germans and who had got his own plan laughter and that he did not think the hour too late at the close of his interesting but not very fair speech to give us the details of his important plan laughter but i notice it as somewhat significant although it must have been a rather discouraging fact to the right hon gentleman that the gradual unfolding of his plan elicited no enthusiasm of any account from any section of the house dissent from the conservative benches and that it was not until he had pointedly appealed to hon members of the conservative party that at last some small section of them would give him a cheer or two and that he did succeed in getting some faint applause from a few gentlemen around the conservative gangway the conservative party has always been most remarkable for its discipline and undoubtedly in its reception of the plan of the prime minister it had in its mind the declaration of the noble lord lord r churchill when he announced in a speech some two or three years ago that they should concede nothing more to the irish nationalists neither in the direction of local self government county boards nor anything else hear hear of course the rank and file of the conservative party under these circumstances could not have ventured to have applauded the right hon gentleman the members for the border burghs and broken away from their allegiance to the noble lord i shall be told perhaps that the noble lord has improved since those days hear hear some say that has caused so much consternation in the mind of the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan i know nothing about these things laughter and i shall not express any opinion upon them but i do think that the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan in the attempted comparison which he appeared to draw between the action of lord spencer in remaining in the cabinet and his own action in leaving it to lord spencer disadvantage scarcely stood on very firm or satisfactory ground irish cheers englishmen love a man who fights his own corner out to the end which lord spencer certainly did cheers he went over to ireland to fight out a battle which was not his to fight the battle of the irish landlords and he stuck to his post cheers he faced every danger every risk both physical and otherwise but the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan did something very like running away from his post some liberal cries of no no although he attempted to explain to the house his reason for leaving the cabinet he did not try to explain to the house why he left his position as chief secretary cheers does the right hon gentleman propose in the event of his plan being carried out to compete for the office of chief secretary and if he be not willing to resume that office himself is it very chivalrous in him to open such a door for future aspirants hear hear the right hon gentleman attempted to prove to the house what terrible things we should do in our irish parliament by allusions to a motion which i moved in mr speaker i do not desire to go back over old quarrels it generally happens that those who are defeated like to recur to these distant and unhappy recollections but i have nothing to retract cheers the right hon gentleman read that resolution to the house which complained of the execution and imprisonment of innocent men i believed then as i believe now that innocent men were executed cheers i never accused the right hon gentleman or lord spencer of having believed the same thing i did not accuse them of having executed innocent men knowing they were innocent but i can scarcely think that the right hon gentleman thinks so to day hear how about the case of brian kilmartin who was sentenced to penal servitude for life i believe and who on his case being brought forward supported by the noble lord lord r churchill and by one or two other prominent conservatives was released during i believe the tenure of office of the right honourable gentleman himself irish cheers the right hon gentleman taunts us with the language of that resolution and with the language of the manifesto which was issued by my hon friend the member for the scotland division of liverpool but if i considered that these things had taken place was i not right at the very height of this reign of terror which then existed in ireland in stating so publicly hear hear i do not see how with any sort of regard for my duty not only to my constituents but my public duty as regards the question of law and order in ireland which the right hon gentleman has constituted himself the sole champion of to night i do not see how i could have refrained from bringing this matter under the notice of the house while the right hon gentleman places such a weighty argument against us in regard to the resolution to which he has referred and to the manifesto of my hon friend he passes over language which has been used since then in ireland by a very prominent member of the late administration hear hear a man who was specially charged with the maintenance of law in that country i mean the late attorney general for ireland home rule cheers who asserted at a public meeting that the blood of giffen was on the head of lord spencer the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has no censure for that language cheers surely no language that was ever used by any of my hon friends exceeded in gravity the charge contained in these words and certainly the language used in the resolution and in the manifesto of my hon friend mr t p o'connor was mildness itself in comparison cheers if this question is to be discussed in the temper i will not say the ill feeling shown by the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs it will undoubtedly not tend to decrease the irritation and ill feeling between the two countries hear hear but i hope the example of the right hon gentleman will not be imitated cheers i do not wish to go into the justification of our action in the last parliament i could do so if i wished i could remind the house of the agencies used by the right hon member for the border burghs in the upholding of law and order in ireland i could remind him of the result of the trial of french case a director of the royal irish constabulary a man whom the right hon gentleman did not shrink from defending in his place home rule cheers but i do not desire to go into these matters i believe however that history will recall that in every resolution we moved in reference to the administration in ireland during his time of office we were more than amply justified by the terrible circumstances surrounding the country at that time hear hear the right hon gentleman has spoken of assassination literature and of sympathy with ireland in america he has spoken of mr ford as having conveyed that sympathy to this country the fact being that mr ford constantly denounced myself and my policy for several years cheers this assassination literature has not been american nor purely irish but there has been a sympathy in america for the just settlement of the claims of ireland to the cession of domestic legislation and that sympathy has been shared by all classes in that country whether irish or native born cheers the right hon gentleman took exception to the proposal to buy out the irish landlords cheers and laughter a measure which if he had succeeded in passing and it had been successful would have involved the payment of a very large sum of money for the purpose with regard to the picture the right hon gentleman drew of the possible consequences that will result to ireland and to england if any proposal such as that now suggested should be adopted i can only say that i believe that so far from anything of the kind happening the guarantees for a peaceable solution of the difficulties between the two countries will be enormously increased and why for several reasons why is there trouble in ireland now why do some talk of separation why does my hon friend the member for tyrone write in what the right hon gentleman sometimes describes as violent passages in united ireland italics it is because the people are desperate and have got nothing to lose home rule cheers but if they have a constitution they will be proportionately careful not to lose it and every violent speech and every criminal action will be so many nails in the coffin of that constitution cheers you will have this in addition to every guarantee you have now for the preservation of peace and order in the country but i now pass to the consideration of the bill hear hear it is difficult to express a definite and positive opinion with regard to a bill before it is in print and i should like to reserve all positive expression of opinion with regard to this measure until i have seen it which i suppose will be on monday but i think it right that i should say something about its merits as explained by the right hon gentleman the member for midlothian i hope it will prove to be a happy and fortunate thing both for ireland and for england that there was one man living one english statesman found of the great power and extraordinary ability of the right hon gentleman to lend his voice to poor helpless ireland on this question cheers to devote his great mind and extraordinary energy to the unravelling of this problem it seems to many people that the task may prove too large hear hear too terrible i believe it will not be so cheers but whatever the fate of the bill the cause of ireland the cause of irish autonomy will have gained enormously in a way it would not otherwise have gained by the genius of the right hon gentleman cheers to ireland to none of the sons of ireland at any time has there ever been given the genius and talent of the right hon gentleman for the energy and time he has devoted to this measure and i believe sincerely in my heart that the result of it will be that the people of england would recognise as the result of what he has done no less than the people of ireland that he had been to them a national benefactor cheers but there are undoubtedly great faults and blots in the measure he has had to meet very hostile criticism and a very

      "mr parnell who was greeted with loud cheers from the irish party on rising said i am glad to find that we have not been disappointed by the lobby rumours which had been circulated for some days past regarding the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and that he after all like the celebrated but unsuccessful french general who defended paris from the germans got his own plan a laugh and that he did not think at the close of his interesting speech to give us the details of this important plan but i noticed the somewhat discouraging fact that his own valuable encomiums of his plan elicited no enthusiasm of any kind from any section of the house cheers and counter cheers i noticed that it was not until he had pointed and pleaded to hon gentlemen the members for the conservative party that at last some small section of them gave him a cheer or two and that he did succeed in getting some faint applause from a few gentlemen belonging to that party irish cheers the conservative party has always been most remarkable in its discipline being sometimes a small party and very often in a minority it is bound to be remarkable undoubtedly in its treatment with respect to the plan of the right hon gentleman the member for midlothian it had in its mind the declaration of the noble lord the member for paddington when he announced in a speech some two or three years since that nothing more should be conceded to the irish nationalists neither in the direction of local self government country boards nor anything else of course the rank and file of the conservative party under these circumstances could not have ventured to applaud the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs and break away from their allegiance to the noble lord the member for paddington lord randolph churchill some say that the noble lord has been flirting with home rule and a separate irish parliament the apprehension of which has caused so much consternation in the mind of the member for the border burghs i know nothing about those things a laugh and i shall not express any opinion upon it hear hear but i do think that the right hon gentleman opposite in attempting the comparison which he appeared to draw between the action of earl spencer in remaining in the cabinet and his own action in leaving it to lord spencer disadvantage scarcely stood on very firm or satisfactory ground englishmen love a man who fights his own corner to the end lord spencer certainly fought his own corner hear hear he went over to ireland to fight out a battle which was not his own and to fight the battle of the irish landlords and he stuck to his post loud irish cheers he faced every danger and every risk both personal and otherwise why the right hon gentleman did something like running away irish cheers and laughter though the right hon gentleman endeavoured to explain to the house his reason for leaving the cabinet he did not try to explain why he had left his position as chief secretary oh oh and cheers if the right hon gentleman was willing to assume that office in ireland it was not a very chivalrous thing for him to take the attitude which to night he says he took with regard to the people generally hear hear the right hon gentleman attempted to prove what terrible things should have been done in ireland when he was chief secretary but for his administration by reading the terms of a motion which i brought forward in i do not desire to go back again over old quarrels it generally happens that those who have been defeated in old quarrels like to refer to them irish cheers and laughter but of his distant and unhappy recollection i have nothing to retract what i said then i say now that then there had been the execution and imprisonment of innocent men i believed it then and i believe it now that innocent men had been executed i never accused the right hon gentleman or lord spencer of having believed the same thing knowing that the executed men were innocent but i can scarcely think that the right hon gentleman thinks so now how about the case of bryan kilmartin who was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude an hon member for life mr parnell i am told he was sentenced to penal servitude for life and whose case when brought forward was supported by the noble lord churchill and one or two conservative members including the hon member for blackburn hear hear and that man was found innocent and i believe that this was during the tenure of the office then held by the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan the right hon gentleman taunts us with the language of the resolution we then brought forward and with the language of the address to irishmen prepared by the hon member for liverpool mr t p o'connor but i consider that these statements were correct and that we had a right to refer to them and because they related to the reign of terror which had then prevailed i do not see how i could have acted otherwise not only to my constituents but out of regard for my public duty as regards law and order of which the right hon gentleman to night poses as the sole champion hear hear and laughter i should have neglected my duty if i had refrained from bringing these matters under the notice of this house and if the occasion arose now i should act in the same way hear hear when the right hon gentleman used the expression he had used with regard to my hon friend mr t p o'connor he forgot that he was no less a person than the attorney general in the late government who used these words in speaking of ireland the right hon gentleman the late attorney general asserted at a public meeting that the blood of giffin was upon the head of lord spencer irish cheers the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has no censure for that language he does not pick out that language as an example of the great risk of entrusting the care of the lives of the irish people to the future conservative administration under the plans he has formulated to night no he passes that by but certainly no language which was ever used by my hon friends has ever exceeded in gravity the charge i have just put cheers which was made by the late attorney general that the blood of giffin was on the head of lord spencer hear hear the language used in the manifesto and in the resolution of my hon friend was mildness itself in comparison cheers but i hope the question will not be discussed by the heat exhibited by the right hon gentleman i do not wish to go into a justification of our action in the late parliament although i could do so if i chose i could remind the house of the agents used by the right hon gentleman in the upholding of law and order in ireland i could remind them of the result of the trial in french case a man whom the right hon gentleman actually did not shrink from defending in this house but i do not desire to go into these things but will leave history to report that in every resolution we moved with reference to the administration of the right hon gentleman during his term of office we were more than often we were more than justified in what we did cheers he was right in saying this assassination literature is not american literature but if he had really devoted exclusive study to it he would have found that neither is it irish literature if the right hon gentleman were to study the literature of america at the moment he would find that sympathy for a just settlement of the grievances of ireland by the concession of a domestic legislature is shown by all classes whether irish or native born americans hear hear and more especially native born americans are welcoming the efforts of the prime minister in the belief that they will bring peace between england and ireland and more especially between irish americans and england it is a remarkable fact that the indecipherable meetings now being held in favour of an irish legislature are heavily called together and organised by native born americans by editors and conductors of purely american newspapers we regard the fact that during the last five or six months we have succeeded in entirely gaining the sympathy of the two great political parties in america the democrats and the republicans as a good omen for the future the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan spoke about the land purchase bill and he turned to the radical members near him to catch a cheer in the denunciation of the proposal to give money to an irish government but i do not propose to go into that beyond saying upon this and other matters that it is not out of the mouth of the right hon gentleman that such words should proceed for did not he under the late government bring in a bill to buy out the irish landlords hear hear a bill which if he had succeeded in passing but fortunately it was added to a long list of failures but if he had succeeded in passing it and if it had been successful a still more doubtful prospect would have necessitated the additional payment of a very large sum of money towards buying out irish landlords and the very thing he denounces to day with so much eloquence hear hear leaving the right honourable gentleman i may say as regards his picture of the horrible consequences that may result to ireland and to england if any proposal such as that suggested in the bill under discussion were adopted i believe that so far from anything of the kind happening that it contains a peaceful solution of the difficulties between the two countries and why for several reasons why are there such troubles in ireland now why is there talk of separation why does not my hon friend the member for tyrone write what the right hon gentleman would consider violent passages in united ireland italics it is because the people are desperate they have nothing to lose hear hear but give them a constitution and they will be proportionately careful not to lose that parnellite cheers every violent speech every criminal action will be so many nails driven into the coffin of that constitution you will have every guarantee you have now and those cannot be weakened very much you will have the forces of the crown which will act just as freely and effectively as they can now no possible adjunct in aid of physical force can be gained by the irish separatists by the provisions of such a measure as that explained to us even the control of the constabulary is to be withheld from us until their character has been changed because they are an armed force you have required armed policemen to govern ireland but we are expected to govern it with none at all then too you will have those guarantees of peace and contentment which have always accompanied the concession of measures such as this to the colonies as the surest and best guarantees in addition to those you possess at present hear i will pass on to the consideration of the bill my attention to which has been withdrawn by the speech of the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan it is difficult to express a definite or positive opinion with regard to the bill before it has been printed and i should like to reserve a too positive expression of opinion until i have seen the measure which i suppose will be issued on monday but still i think it is right that i should say something about its merits as they have been explained to us by the right hon gentleman the member for midlothian allow me to say sir that i think it will prove to be a happy and fortunate thing both for ireland and england that there was one man living an english statesman with the great power and the extraordinary ability of the right hon gentleman to lend his voice to poor helpless ireland on this question irish cheers he has devoted his great mind his extraordinary energy to the unravelling of this question it seems to many people that the task may be too large too terrible even for the right hon gentleman i believe it will not be so home rule cheers but whatever may be the fate of the measure i believe the cause of ireland of irish autonomy will gain enormously in a way it never could have otherwise gained by the genius of the right honourable gentleman hear hear he has drafted his bill and explained it in a speech which from anyone else might have been called extraordinary to none of the sons of ireland at any time has ever been given the genius and talent of the right hon gentleman certainly nothing approaching it in these days i thank him therefore for the energy and the time he has devoted to this matter and i believe sincerely in my heart that the result will be that the people of england will recognise as the result of what he has done that he has been to them no less than to the people of ireland a national benefactor cheers but there are undoubtedly great faults and blots in the measure the right hon gentleman has had to meet very extraordinary criticism and a very extraordinary state of affairs he has seen his officers leaving his side one by one and drawing their swords on him as the member for the border burghs has done to night he has had i suppose to shape his measure to meet the great opposition worked against it but there are several points it will be our duty when the measure reaches its committee stage to oppose very strongly and to press for serious modification and amendment the question of the customs has been touched on in giving up the customs that would practically mean giving up to you the control of six eighths or three fourths of the revenue of ireland it would be absolutely as much in your power as it is now both in regard to the original assignment of the taxes and the receiving of the money the right hon gentleman has indeed explained that if we were to insist on a separate custom house that england could deprive ireland by collecting in ireland the duties on whisky and tobacco of a year this would be a serious matter and it may be fairly balanced against the control of the customs and the excise but if the prime minister is to claim credit for giving us by the retention of customs within the imperial authority he cannot claim credit for it over again and make us pay out of that a year for the irish constabulary over whom we are to have no control whatever at all events for the present then there is the question of contribution to the imperial exchequer i cannot admit and i say it with great deference i cannot admit the justice or the liberality of the standard of comparison the right hon gentleman has taken this is the most unfavourable standard to us that the right hon gentleman could have chosen of course he is anxious to make the best bargain he can for england and to secure as large a contribution for the imperial treasury as is possible but he should remember that ireland is a very poor country and that with such a small balance as he shows of about a year it will be absolutely impossible for ireland to have any credit in the direction of floating loans now we are able to borrow from the treasury large sums of money for various purposes in ireland irish landlords irish tenants and local authorities can borrow money all these are very important matters but we shall have to surrender them under the scheme of the right hon gentleman and we shall be left with a budget which will exceed the annual balance by about a year and a budget arrived at on an estimate which necessitates that the consumption of spirits not only in ireland but also in england should continue at its present rate and that the duty should be kept as now as i suppose it will be it is scarcely fair to press us too closely or to insist upon too hard or too close a bargain in regard to this matter of course whatever the sum agreed upon is we must pay it and we will pay it hear hear but it would be most unfortunate if the result of such a standard of comparison as the right hon gentleman has selected should be to impoverish the irish exchequer in that case only would there be any possibility of the danger which the right hon gentleman mr trevelyan has conjured up with regard to an attempted repudiation of the imperial debt an attempt which if made would be entirely unsuccessful because you would have the collection of the excise absolutely in your own hands when you are proposing a great settlement a settlement which admittedly can only succeed if it is cheerfully accepted by public opinion in ireland if all its important provisions are recognised as just and equitable is it worth while on the part of a rich country like england to drive too hard a bargain i am convinced that we have a much stronger case for the adoption of a standard of 20th or 22nd as the relative wealth of the two countries than the right hon gentleman has for adopting the very unfavourable standard of 15th i have every confidence that when the time comes in committee and when we put our case regarding this most important financial question that the consciences not only of the house of commons but also of the right hon gentleman the prime minister will be touched in this matter and that he will see that his zeal for making a good bargain for his own country in the question of imperial contribution has led him into doing an unintentional injustice to ireland then again i think that the question of the royal irish constabulary has been left in a most unsatisfactory state it is unfair to ask us to pay a force or a large proportion of a force over which we shall have no control whatever but some light might be thrown upon that by a perusal of the bill itself when issued and by proceedings in committee hear hear then came the vote by orders that had been explained by the right hon gentleman to be that it gave the first order the twenty eight peers the right to hang up any bill for three years three years or a dissolution thus it would be absolutely within the power of the first order to hang up any measure it pleased and so bring the whole proceedings of the legislature to a deadlock this is a very important point and i say that i have strongly insisted upon such a proportional representation of the protestant minority as would give them representation according to their numerical strength and as far as the first order was concerned it might be very well with a view to preventing any rash hasty ill considered legislation and with that i cordially agree hear hear but so far as it acts or could be made to act as an obstruction to legislation or as a means of bringing about a political deadlock on the part of a body of members who could scarcely be said to be representative i think it should be moderated so as to make it impossible hear hear as regards the measure itself the prime minister has truly said that it ought not to proceed unless it is cheerfully welcomed not only by the irish members but the irish people i quite agree with that i am convinced that if our views are fairly met in committee with regard to the defects to which i have alluded that the effects of its working will be to agreeably disappoint the right hon member for the border burgh and that this proposal will be cheerfully accepted by the irish people and by her representatives as a solution of the longstanding dispute between the two countries and that it will be to the prosperity and peace of ireland and to the satisfaction of england cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was warmly cheered by his party said if i intervene in this contest of gravity which has been proceeding so many days it is not because i suppose my intervention is specially suited to the occasion under ordinary circumstances i should have lacked self confidence following so able and eloquent a member of the house but thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just cheers and inferior as i am in many points of view i hope i shall not be so far behind as usual hear hear without intending to offer any disrespect to the right hon gentleman i could not help thinking listening to his speech that in all the lost causes with which i have seen him connected during many years past he was never so little effective as in contending against the bill we hope to read for a second time to night hear hear he has sought i think very unfairly to cast a lurid light on the situation by allusion to those unhappy outrages in kerry sir i join the right hon gentleman in the expression of my contempt for those cowardly disgraceful practices i join him to the fullest extent hear hear but sir rather do i say it is because evictions have been more numerous in kerry than in all the rest of munster put together during months past i do not say that that constitutes an excuse for these outrages or any excuse for outrages though it may supply us with the cause of them but when i denounce outrage i denounce them in every part of ireland whether they occur in ulster or in kerry hear hear the right hon gentleman himself is certainly free from reproach he has not joined the noble lord churchill and the right hon gentleman mr chamberlain in the use of reckless language with reference to the affairs of a country which is not their country hear hear an interference for which they have not even the paltry excuse that it was any business of theirs or that they had any interest there my colleagues have in times past been reproached because they have not been careful into looking into the effect of their language and the doctrine of indirect responsibility has been employed against them to the extent of imprisonment if that doctrine of indirect responsibility were employed against the noble lord and the right hon gentleman mr chamberlain the former might plead for excuse that he himself is nothing and nobody but himself so that he could not expect any great importance to be attached to his declarations hear hear and laughter while the right hon gentleman might have said and said very truly that he was absolutely ignorant of all the circumstances of ireland his celebrated projected visit to that country last autumn not having come off he really could not know what would be the effect of his language hear hear however we have the result now in one murder already committed in belfast and i trust that in future hon and right hon gentlemen will remember the importance and gravity of the occurrences which may follow in ulster those occurrences cannot go further at the outside than outrage and assassination but will depend very much upon what is said on the subject and the amount of importance given to the doings of ulster men we do say and admit that these occurrences are to be condemned and should be stopped but while the noble lord and the right hon gentleman say they must be put an end to by resorting to the coercion which they and their friends have been using in the last years we say with the prime minister try the effect of self government cheers then if kerry men resort to outrage they will very soon find the rest of ireland will put a stop to it renewed cheers well sir the right hon gentleman referred to the recent events in belfast but before i deal with that terrible matter i wish to give an explanation because as usual some of the english newspapers have perverted for their own purposes what i believe actually took place irish cheers i was pained to see that the struggle is alleged to have arisen out of an expression used by a catholic to a fellow workman who was a protestant to the effect that in a short time more none of his persuasion should be allowed to earn a crust of bread in ireland that however does not accurately represent the state of facts as reported in the local newspapers cheers and counter cheers according to them what took place was this a catholic overseer of the works found fault with the way in which an orange or at all events a protestant workman was executing the digging of a drain the overseer said that is a nice way to do the work whereupon the orangeman replied to his overseer who happened to be a catholic what does a papist know about digging drains laughter and the overseer irritated i do not say justly irritated because it was absurd for him to have been irritated by such a remark said to the orangeman you will never earn a crust on the works again meaning that he was dismissed upon that the orangeman took his shovel and left his work i believe as he was going out he was assaulted by one or more of the workmen derisive laughter it is very difficult to know actually what took place but it is of great importance that the house should understand that the remark in question had not a general application but only an individual one parnellite cheers i do not attempt to justify the occurrence because it was a very sad one hear hear mr goschen has spoken about the sovereignty of parliament and upon this point i entirely agree with the definition given by the secretary for foreign affairs cheers we know perfectly well we have always known since this bill was introduced the difference between a co ordinate and a sub ordinate parliament cheers we knew that the legislature the prime minister wishes to constitute is a subordinate parliament not like grattan's which was co equal mr gladstone hear hear arising out of the same constitution and in the same manner as this parliament given by the sovereign ministerial cheers we understand this perfectly well and we should undoubtedly have preferred as i stated on the introduction of the bill as showing that i could not accept this as a final settlement of the question we should have preferred the restitution of the grattan parliament parnellite cheers it would have been more in accord with the sentiments of the irish people and sentiment goes a long way with people like the irish cheers at the same time i am bound to say that if i should have preferred a grattan parliament there are practical advantages in the proposals before us which limit and subordinate the parliament to that in which we now act it may be of even greater advantage to the irish people than a parliament like grattan's and much more likely to be a final settlement of the question hear hear grattan parliament had many disadvantages in the first place it had a house of lords hear and a laugh we get rid of the house of lords under the constitution of the right hon gentleman cheers it is true there is to be in its place the first order a very salutary provision i do not pledge myself to all the details and qualifications but i say generally that the first order is a very salutary provision which will tend to prevent hasty legislation and immediate action cheers and i would rather see a bill hung up for ten years by a body like the first order in ireland than i would see it hung up for a single twenty four hours by this imperial parliament hear hear i venture to express the opinion that the constant action of the imperial parliament the constant means of overseeing as is suggested by the member for west birmingham mr chamberlain would not have the same success and would not be so acceptable to the people of ireland as the measure now proposed by the government hear hear indeed the proposals of the member for west birmingham would i believe be mischievous and dangerous and would prevent any settlement being arrived at satisfactory to the irish people home rule cheers on the other hand when we are assembled in our own chamber in ireland all the different sections of the irish people those causes and effects which always arise will come into operation again and will lead to satisfactory results the result of the two orders working together in the same chamber will enable great questions to be settled on a basis of compromise more or less satisfactory to all parties cheers we understand perfectly well that the imperial parliament has the ultimate supremacy and the ultimate sovereignty i quite agree with the prime minister and i think it is one of the most valuable parts of the bill i quite agree that that which the prime minister offers namely the responsibility of maintaining order in ireland by the irish parliament is a correct provision and one which no state could exist without irish cheers the supremacy of the imperial parliament however will not be affected by this if the irish parliament execute the powers given to it whilst in some cases it may be rendered more effective than ever hear hear in accepting the bill we accept honourable obligations and we pledge ourselves for the irish people as far as we can pledge ourselves derisive cheering and laughter that the powers given shall not be abused parnellite cheers to devote all the energy ability and influence we may have with our people to prevent them abusing the powers entrusted to them cheers but if abuses do take place the imperial parliament may intervene in cases of grave emergency you have the power you have the authority you have the force and if crimes are perpetrated you have the remedy in your own hands hear hear in a case of this kind you have just the same authority you would have whether the bill had been brought forward or not and this we recognise i said this on the introduction of the bill i said we would accept it as a final settlement and that i believed the irish people would do so i will say no more upon that point but my words have been singularly justified parnellite cheers we have had this measure accepted by all the leaders of every section of national feeling in ireland and also outside ireland in the united states as well as in every country where the irish people were found cheers we have not had a single voice raised against the bill by any irishman cheers and cries of oh oh certainly not by any irishman of nationalist opinion and of course there are sections among the irish nationalists just as there are sections in the great conservative party hear hear in fact as far as it was possible for the nation to accept the measure cheerfully freely thankfully and without reserve i say that the irish people have shown that they have so accepted this measure cheers even the terrible irish world italics newspaper which has not been on my side for the last five or six years says the irish race at home and abroad have signified their willingness to accept the terms of peace offered by mr gladstone cheers i say then that as far as the irish people can accept this bill they have accepted it and they have accepted it without any reserve whatever as a measure which may be considered a final settlement of a great question now sir i leave the question of the sovereignty of parliament and go to another point which ahs been touched on by the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh mr goschen he has fairly told us of his fears as to the abuse of power by the irish priesthood in regard to the question of education and he has not followed the example of other illustrious speakers by indulging in extravagant language in regard to this catholic protestant question hear hear i may say that i am quite sure his apprehension is genuine as far as it goes and that he does not desire to see anything in the shape of religious discord in ireland indeed i will not say that as a protestant myself if i had not had abundant experience of the feeling in ireland i might not perhaps be inclined to share his fear but as it is i certainly have no such fear hear it is rather remarkable in regard to this question of education that the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham mr chamberlain proposed to give to a central council in dublin the executive control over education in ireland without any reserve whatever in regard to protestants or catholics cheers it is however very hard to please everybody and if we were to please the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham by agreeing to give education to the control of the body which the prime minister proposes to establish we should be unfortunate in running foul of the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh hear hear but i think i can assure the right hon gentleman that we shall be able to settle this question of education very well among ourselves cheers there are many liberal nationalists i call them liberal nationalists because i think it is the right phrase in reference to its application to education as to which they are liberal that is they do not share the views of the roman catholic church on the question of education there are i say many liberal nationalists in ireland who very much desire to see the people of ulster sharing the responsibilities or the feeling they have with regard to education and i can assure the house that with ulster in an irish legislature and with such representatives as we see coming from ulster to this house there would not be the slightest risk even if there were any idea on the part of the catholic hierarchy of using their power unfairly against the protestants that such a thing would ever take place cheers we should be able to settle this question to the satisfaction of everybody concerned among ourselves cheers but before leaving the question of education there is one thing i must remind the house with reference to the question of education namely that denominational education would undoubtedly be established in ireland cheers this subject has been already considered the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham thinks that denominational education would be the right thing ireland and we may say that if parliament remains as it is and ireland as she is we should find denominational education without effective control impossible on the part of the protestants of ulster the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh spoke of the linen trade i have not had the advantage of reading the correspondence to which he referred but it appeared to me to tend to prove that the linen trade of ulster not directly but indirectly has acted injuriously because it had induced the peasantry to pay rack rents which the landlords would not otherwise have insisted on hear hear i think the right hon gentleman was not quite fair in regard to this question and i observed a similar reticence to that which characterised his dealing with the matter just referred to when he dealt with the financial question on which he made such a point on the first reading of this bill in a speech which undoubtedly produced a great sensation all over the country i and others who listened to that speech understood him to argue that ulster was wealthier than either of the other three provinces and that so heavy a share of the burden would fall on ulster that it would be impossible to carry on the government of ireland the right hon gentleman comparison of the great wealth of ulster with the other provinces has been taken up by the loyal and patriotic unions throughout the country as a sort of war cry the right hon gentleman chose as his standard of comparison schedule d of the income tax referring to trades and professions but surely the plain standards of relative wealth are the assessments under all the schedules as well as the value of ratable sic property had he taken these he would have shown that so far from ulster being the wealthiest of the four provinces she comes in reality third coming after leinster and munster and being only superior to impoverished connaught these standards of income tax show for leinster 6s 9d per head munster 0s 7d ulster 14s 3d and connaught 13s 7d the relative proportions of wealth in decimals being for leinster for munster for ulster or little more than half the wealth of leinster and for connaught cheers if you take any other fair test the result will be the same but the right hon gentleman also argued that there was great disparity between the protestant counties or the north eastern counties and the catholic counties of ulster and he showed the disparity to be a great deal larger than it really is through the system of comparison he chose a system that was not a fair one but the one that would show best for his argument undoubtedly there is a disparity between the relative wealth of the north eastern counties and the other counties but the same disproportion runs through ireland if you draw a meridian line through ireland the counties to the west are comparatively poor the reason is obvious the wealth of the country goes towards the trading coast the trade of ireland the ports and shipping and the main distributing centres where men of business and wealth congregates are found on the east and as is only natural the east of ulster and munster and leinster are wealthier than the west of those provinces hear hear we come now to the question of the protection of the loyal minority it is one upon which great attention has been bestowed one would think that the protestants of ireland were going to be handed over to the tender mercies of thugs and bandits major saunderson hear hear the hon and gallant member for north armagh cheers that i only wish i was as safe in the north of ireland when i go there as the hon and gallant gentleman would be in the south home rule cheers what do these gentlemen mean by the protection of the loyal minority in the first place i would ask what they mean by the loyal minority hear hear the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh does not seem to have made up his mind even at this late stage of the debate as to what the loyal minority is when asked he said that he meant the same loyal minority as that which was referred to by the prime minister in his speech but he would not commit himself by telling us what significance he attributed to the prime minister statemen i have examined the prime minister references since then and i find the prime minister referred to the whole province of ulster he did not select a little bit of the province because the opposition had not discussed the point at the time consequently i suppose i may assume that the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh also refers to the whole province of ulster when he asks that special protection should be given but he has not told us how he would specially protect it but we may take it from the plans of some of his colleagues it is one of the features of this debate that you have to go the round of the opposition speaking and select a little bit from one and a little bit from another and a little bit from a third in order to make some sort of coherent plan of opposition and even then the results are very unsatisfactory but the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham has supplied a plan he has claimed for ulster and i suppose the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh when the proper time comes will support him in the claim he has claimed a separate legislature for ulster well sir you would not protect the loyal minority of ireland even supposing you gave a separate legislature to the province of ulster because there are outside that province protestants who would still be without any protection so far as you propose to give it then you would make the position of these protestants by taking away ulster from them infinitely less secure hear hear you would not even protect the protestants of ulster because the protestants according to the last census were in the proportion of to and we have every reason to believe that now the protestants and catholics in ulster are about equal in number at all events however that may be the nationalists have succeeded in returning the majority of the ulster members home rule cheers the main reason why we have a majority of the ulster members is that a large proportion of protestant nationalists voted in the closely divided constituencies throughout ulster in favour of the nationalist candidates so you would still have the nationalists to deal with in ulster even supposing you had a separate legislature there and the very first thing that an ulster legislature would do would be to unite itself with the dublin parliament hear well sir driven away from the fiction of protestant ulster the opponents of the bill upon this point seek refuge in the north east corner of ulster consisting of three counties then there comes in the difference that instead of protecting the majority of protestants by constituting a legislature for the north east corner of ulster you would abandon the majority of the protestants of ireland to their fate under a dublin parliament seven twelfths of the protestants of ireland live outside of the three counties in the north east corner of ulster and only five twelfths of the protestants live inside them so that whatever way you put it you must give up the idea of protecting the protestants of ireland by the establishment of a separate legislature either in ulster or in any portion of ulster now sir we cannot give up a single irishman hear and cheers we want the energy the patriotism the talent and the work of every irishman hear here to ensure that this great experiment should be a success the best system of government for a country i believe to be one which requires that that government should be the result of all the forces of the country hear hear we cannot give away to a legislature any portion of the talent and influence of the protestants this class will form a most valuable element in the irish legislature constituting as they will a strong minority and exercising through the first order a moderating influence on the making of laws we have heard of the danger which will beset the first trial by an untrained and prentice legislature i regard their presence as vitally necessary in the irish parliament we want all creeds and all classes in our parliament hear hear we cannot consent to look upon a single irishman as not belonging to us and however much we recognise their great ability we admit the ability of the irish protestants and their influence we cannot admit that there is a single one of them too good to take part in the work we admit there is a small proportion of them who fear the treatment they will receive at the hands of an irish parliament we shall do our best as we have been doing to allay the fears of this small section when this bill becomes an act we shall not cease from the work of conciliating the fears of this small section of the irish people theirs is not the shame and disgrace of those fears the shame and disgrace belong to the right hon gentlemen and to the lords belonging to english political parties who for the selfish interests of these english political parties seek to rekindle the almost expiring embers of political and religious rancour home rule cheers ireland had never injured the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham i do not know why he should have added the strength of his powerful aid and why he should have thrown his sword into the indecipherable against us and why he should seek to dash the cup from the lips of the irish people the first cup of cold water that has been offered to our nation since the recall of lord fitzwilliam this settlement will i believe be a final settlement hear hear it has been reproached and it has been made an argument against the honesty of my declaration with regard to the final character of the settlement that i have claimed the right of protecting irish manufactures and that this bill gives no protection to the irish manufactures well sir undoubtedly we claimed that right but it was not when the liberal party was in power a laugh that speech at wicklow about protection was made at a time when we had every reason to know that the conservative party if they should be successful at the polls would have offered to ireland a statutory legislature with a right to protect her own manufactures laughter and loud ministerial and home rule cheers and that this would have been coupled with a settlement of the irish land question on the basis of purchase on a larger scale than that now proposed by the prime minister renewed cheering i should not have thought and i never did think and i don't think now of claiming the right of protecting irish manufactures from the liberal party i never expected it and i don't expect it now therefore i recognise the settlement as a final settlement without protection but there is another and a stronger argument still the prime minister showed us when he introduced the bill that we should lose a year which will come to us as a consequence of fiscal union and the absence of protection is a very good quid pro quo as i have said before for the loss of protection the question of the retention of the irish members at westminster is one on which i shall touch very slightly with regard to this matter i have always desired to keep my mind thoroughly open and not to make it a vital question i have seen great difficulties difficulties rather from your point of view than from ours and i think that when we come to consider the question in committee those difficulties will grow but i don't desire in any sense to prejudge the question i count the existence of a strong sentiment on the part of liberal members i won't say it is a very reasonable sentiment when i consider how many times my colleagues and i have been forcibly ejected and how even the necessity of suspending the representation of ireland in this house has been eagerly canvassed by the london press as the only necessary solution of the irish question it is a difficult question and requires very serious consideration when the prime minister has produced his plan we shall without binding ourselves to it beforehand examine it candidly with the desire to see in it elements which will not injure the permanency of the settlement we have gone through it all before i know the reign of coercion there has been during the last five years you will require an even serverer and more drastic measure of coercion than you have now you will require everything you have had during the last five years and more besides home rule cheers and of what sort has that coercion been renewed home rule cheers i do not say this to inflame passions and to embitter animosity but you have had during these five years the suspension of the habeas corpus act in ireland you have had a thousand of our irish fellow subjects held in prison without a specific charge many of them for long periods of time some of them for twenty months without trial and without any intention of placing them on trial hear hear and cheers you have had the right of domicile infringed at any hour of the day or night and you have fined the innocent for the offences committed by the guilty hear hear you have taken power to expel aliens from the country you have renewed the curfew law and blood money of your norman conquerors you have gagged the press and seized and suppressed newspapers you have manufactured now crimes and offences and applied fresh penalties unknown to your law all these and much more you have done in the last five years home rule cheers and all this and much more you will do again loud opposition cheers the provision in the bill for terminating the irish representation here has been vehemently attacked and mr trevelyan said there was no half way house between separation and the executive autonomy of the irish people i say with just as much belief and just as much experience as the right hon gentleman that in my judgment there is no half way house between granting legislative autonomy to ireland and the disenfranchisement and disseverance of that country but sir i refuse to believe that those evils will come i am convinced that there are a sufficient number of members of this house who will disregard the appeal made to their passions which has been made and that when the numbers in the division lobby shall have been told to night it will be known that this parliament in the nineteenth century was wise enough and brace enough and generous enough to agree to give peace and happiness to suffering ireland loud and

      "mr parnell whose rising was received with prolonged home rule cheers said if i intervene in the contest of giants which has been proceeding so many days in this house in reference to this great question it is not because i suppose that the intervention is specially suited to the moment and i certainly should not under ordinary circumstances have felt any self confidence whatever in following so able and eloquent a member of this house as the right hon gentleman the member for the eastern division of edinburgh but thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just loud irish cheers and even a man so inferior from every point of view as myself to the right hon gentleman may hope upon this occasion not to be so much behind as usual sir without intending to offer any disrespect to the right hon gentleman i could not help thinking when listening to his speech that in all the lost causes which i have seen him attempt to defend home rule and some ministerial cheers during many years past he was never so little effective as when contending against the bill which we hope to see read a second time to night home rule cheers sir the right hon gentleman has sought i think very unfairly to cast a lurid light upon the situation by an allusion to those unhappy outrages which have been occurring in kerry hear hear from the home rulers i join the right hon gentleman in the expression of contempt for those cowardly and disgraceful practices home rule cheers i join him to the fullest extent but sir neither do i say because evictions have been more numerous in kerry than in all the rest of munster added together hear hear from the home rulers during months past that that fact is an excuse for these outrages or is any excuse whatever for such occurrences although it might supply us with the cause for them but when i denounce outrages i denounce them sir in all parts of ireland home rule cheers whether they occur in ulster or in kerry the right hon gentleman himself is certainly free from reproach in respect of this matter he has not joined the noble lord the member for south paddington home rule cheers and the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham loud home rule cheers in the use of reckless language with reference to the affairs of a country which is not their country renewed home rule cheers an interference for which they had not the paltry excuse that it was any business of theirs or that they really felt any interest in it hear hear my colleagues some of them have been reproached in times past because they had not been very careful in looking into what might be the effect of their language the doctrine of indirect responsibility has been employed against many of them to the extent of imprisonment hear hear but if the doctrine of indirect responsibility had been employed against the noble lord the member for south paddington and the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham the former might have pleaded for an excuse that as he believes in nobody and in nothing except himself laughter so he could not have expected any great importance to be attached to his declarations hear hear while the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham might have said and said very truly that he was absolutely ignorant of all the circumstances of ireland his celebrated projected visit to that country last autumn not having come off laughter and that consequently he really did not know what would come of his language however sir we have the result now in one murder which has already been committed in belfast hear hear from the home rulers and i trust that in future right hon gentlemen will remember that the importance and the gravity of occurrences which may follow in ulster and these occurrences cannot go further at the outside than outrage and assassination will depend very much upon what they say and upon the amount of importance that they give to the doings of ulstermen in the minds of these people themselves hear hear certainly sir i do condemn these occurrences in kerry and the right hon gentleman very properly said they must be put a stop to well so say we all loud home rule cheers the right hon gentleman wants to put a stop to them by resorting to the old methods of coercion which he and his friends have been using for the last eighty six years but we say with the prime minister try the effect of self government home rule cheers and if kerrymen then resort to outrage they will very soon find that the rest of ireland will soon put a stop to these outrages home rule cheers before i leave the terrible occurrences in belfast i wish to give an explanation because as usual the english newspapers have for their own purposes misrepresented what took place i was very much pained on reading that it was alleged the disturbance arose out of an expression used by a catholic workman to a protestant workman that in a short time none of his religious persuasion would be allowed to earn a crust of bread in ireland that does not represent the correct state of facts as they are reported in the local newspapers what actually took place according to these reports was a catholic overseer of the works found fault with the way in which another workman an orangeman i think at all events a protestant was executing the digging out of a drain and he said to him this is a nice way in which you are digging out this drain the orangeman said in reply to his overseer what does a papist know about digging drains laughter and the overseer irritated i will not say justly because it would be absurd to be irritated by such an expression said in reply you will never earn a crust at these works again meaning he should dismiss him hear hear that is all right that is all i want replied the man and he took up his shovel and left the works i believe as he was leaving he was assaulted by one or more of the other workmen some opposition laughter it is so difficult to know what is true with regard to any irish matter laughter it is of great importance that the house should understand that this remark had no a general but had only an individual application hear hear at the same time i am not to be taken as justifying the occurrence on the part of those employed in the yard in the slightest degree the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh spoke about the sovereignty of parliament upon this point i entirely accept and agree with the definitions given by the hon and learned gentleman the member for one of the divisions of aberdeen under secretary of state for foreign affairs we have always perceived since the introduction of this bill the difference between a co ordinate parliament and a subordinate parliament we have recognised that the legislature which the right hon gentleman the prime minister proposes to constitute is a subordinate parliament hear hear that it is not like grattan parliament which was coequal hear hear from mr gladstone arising out of the same constitution given to the irish people by the crown just in the same way though not by the same means as parliamentary institutions were given to great britain by the sovereign we understand this perfectly well and we should undoubtedly have preferred as i stated in speeches which have been quoted against me as showing that i could not accept this proposed settlement as final i should have preferred the restitution of grattan parliament it would have been more in accordance with the sentiments of the irish people and sentiment goes a long way in dealing with a people like the irish but at the same time in reference to the argument used against us that i am precluded from accepting this solution as final because i have claimed a restitution of grattan parliament i would say that i consider there are practical advantages in a statutory body limited and subordinate to this imperial parliament as it undoubtedly would be which will render it much more useful and advantageous to the irish people than grattan parliament would be grattan parliament had many disadvantages in the first place it had a house of lords home rule and radical cheers we get rid of the house of lords under the constitution of the right hon gentleman it is true that in its place there is to be a first order a very salutary provision although i do not agree with the extent of time the first order is allowed to hang up a bill or with some of the qualifications hear hear these are subordinate matters a laugh but i say the first order is a very salutary provision which will tend to prevent rash legislation and immoderate action on the part of the new body and i would rather see a bill hung up for ten years by a body such as the first order than hung up for twenty hour hours by the superior parliament home rule cheers i venture to express that opinion regarding the effect and the irritation which constant meddling and overseeing as suggested by the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham on the part of this imperial parliament would have on the minds of the people of ireland hear hear it would be most mischievous and dangerous and sure to prevent such a settlement but when we are all assembled in one chamber different sections of irishmen thrashing out a subject those causes and those effects which have always come into operation under similar circumstances will be also produced in ireland and discussion may be relied upon to bring about the settlement of controverted points of course we too have controverted subjects and the result of those two orders working together in the same chamber will be that great questions will be settled on the basis of compromise and more or less to the satisfaction of both parties we therefore understand perfectly well that this parliament has the ultimate supremacy and sovereignty i have spoken of the detail of the house of lords in grattan parliament another very important matter in grattan parliament was the defect alluded to by the right hon gentleman the member for east edinburgh that the executive was divorced from the legislative body fox i think said there could be no perfect system of government in which the executive and legislative bodies are not joined together i agree with that statement and i think one of the most valuable parts of this bill is that by which the prime minister throws responsibility on the legislature to maintain that order in ireland without which no society can exist hear hear i understand the supremacy of the imperial parliament to mean this it is effective as has been pointed out in the event of the irish body exceeding its powers but it might under certain circumstances be more effective i can illustrate this by saying that in accepting this bill i think we come under an honourable obligation not to abuse our powers and we pledge ourselves some derisive opposition cheers and home rule counter cheers not to abuse those powers and to devote our energies and any ability or influence we may have with our people to prevent them abusing those powers but if this abuse should take place the imperial parliament is here in its full plenitude of power ready to intervene but ready to intervene only in the case grave and urgent necessity home rule and ministerial cheers believe me this is far the best way you can deal with this question you will have the power of force of course we know when abuses are committed and injustice is perpetrated force is the real power but you will have also the power of this imperial parliament untouched and unimpaired just as if this bill had never been enacted we recognise this as i have said and i say again i said on the first reading immediately after i heard the statement of the prime minister and i say now that i accept this bill as a final settlement of our national question and i believe the irish people will accept it home rule cheers of course you may not believe my words in the connection have been signally justified by the result irish cheers we have had this measure accepted in the sense i have indicated by the leaders of every section of national opinion in ireland and also outside ireland in the united states of america with the vengeance of the irish population of which some speakers against this bill are so fond of threatening us irish laughter and cheers we have not had a single syllable a single voice against this bill by any irishman irish tory cries of oh oh by any irishman of nationalist opinion of course there are sections amongst irish nationalists just as there are sections in the great conservative party laughter but so far as it was possible for a nation to accept a measure cheerfully freely gratefully and without reserve i say that the irish people have shown that they accepted this measure loud home rule cheers even the terrible irish world italics which has not been on my side for the last five or six years says the irish race at home and abroad have signified their willingness to accept the terms proposed by mr gladstone cheers if a coercion bill be now passed by parliament it will be equivalent to a declaration of war on the part of england tory ironical cheers we do not agree with mr patrick ford in his conclusion during the last five or six years we thoroughly differ from him and he has returned the compliment by using every opportunity to condemn us so that the honours are pretty easy cheers and laughter but so far as the irish people could accept this bill they have accepted it without any reserve whatever as one that will be a final settlement of this great question irish and liberal cheers now sir i will leave the question of the sovereignty of parliament and i will go to another point which has been touched upon by the hon gentleman the member for edinburgh mr goschen he has fairly told us of his fears with regard to abuses on the part of the irish priesthood in reference to the question of education the right hon gentleman certainly has not followed the example of other illustrious persons laughter by indulging in extravagant language on the protestant and catholic question hear hear from the irish members and i am quite sure that his apprehension is genuine so far as it goes by the does not desire to fan the flames of religious bigotry amongst us hear hear he has spoken very fairly and i wish to say that perhaps as a protestant if i had not abundant experience of the feeling in ireland i might have shared these feelings myself certainly i have no such fears cheers but it is rather remarkable that this question of education is the only matter the right hon gentleman has any fears about in dealing with the question of protestant and catholic in ireland it is rather remarkable that when the right hon gentleman the member for birmingham mr chamberlain proposed to give us a central council in dublin he proposed that it should have exclusive control over education without any reservation whatever with regard to ulster protestants or anybody else cheers i believe in that scheme also there was to be a first and second order hear hear sir it is very hard to please everybody hear and laughter and while we please the right hon member for west birmingham in regard to accepting the education scheme which the prime minister proposes to establish we regret that we are unfortunate enough to run foul of the right hon member for east edinburgh hear hear but i do assure the right hon gentleman that we shall settle this question of education very well amongst ourselves irish cheers and there are very many liberal nationalists i call them liberal nationalists because i take the phrase in reference to this question of education there are many liberal nationalists that do not share those views of the roman catholic church on the question of the control of education and who are very much influenced in their desire to see ulster remain a part of the irish legislative body and sharing the responsible duties of governing ireland by the feeling that they have with regard to this question of education and i am sure that with ulster in the irish legislature and with her representatives coming there as they are here there would not be the slightest risk if there was indeed any such idea on the part of the catholic hierarchy and priesthood to use their power unfairly against the protestants loud irish and liberal cheers but as i said we shall be able to settle this and other questions together very satisfactorily and to the satisfaction of everybody concerned cheers there is one thing further i wish to say that as things are going on in this house in reference to the education question there is no doubt that denominational education would be established in ireland in a very few years that is a point that is already conceded even by the right hon member for birmingham that right hon gentleman agrees that denominational education is the right thing for ireland and i am sure that we might say that if parliament remains as it is and that if ireland remains as it is we should find denominational education established in ireland in a very few years hear hear the right hon gentleman the member for edinburgh spoke of the linen trade and i think he was rather unfair to my hon friend the member for the stephen green division of dublin mr gray i have not had time to look at the series of letters on the question to which he refers but the part of the letters that he quoted to prove that the articles went to show that the linen trade was the curse of ulster was one passage out of many letters intended to prove that the linen trade had been the curse of ulster not directly but indirectly because it enabled the landlords to extract rack rents from tenants on which the landlords otherwise would not have insisted hear hear and i don't think that in his argument the right hon gentleman was fair in seeking to carry the matter further than that indeed he did not attempt to carry it further he observed a similar reticence on the financial question in regard to which he made so much on his speech on the first reading sir the speech of the right hon gentleman on the occasion produced a very great sensation in the house and in the country it was understood that the right hon gentleman intended to show and i believe the country understood him so to intend that first ulster was wealthier than any of the other three provinces and secondly that the burden of the taxation would fall on ulster and that without ulster it would be impossible to carry on the government of ireland the hon gentleman did not pursue this financial question very far to day irish cheers but it is perhaps not improper that we should direct a little more attention to it since this question of the wealth of ulster has been made a sort of war cry by the loyal and patriotic union cheers in his first speech the right hon gentleman was not very fair in selecting schedule d of the income tax that relating to trades and professions as his standard and measure of the relative wealth of the four provinces laughter a fairer standard of relative wealth would have been the assessment for income tax on all the schedules and also the rateable values of the property in the four provinces and this would show that so far from ulster being the wealthiest it was the third in relative amount of wealth cheers these assessments show conclusively and the right hon gentleman will not now deny that they show that ulster comes third in point of relative wealth that she comes after leinster after munster and that she is only superior to unfortunate connaught cheers the assessment of income tax per head in leinster is 6s 2d for munster 0s 7d for ulster 14s 5d and for connaught 13s 7d the figures as to the relative values are the only fair tests and they are leinster munster ulster or only a little more than half of leinster and connaught if you take any other fair tests similar results will be arrived at and you will find that instead of being the first with regard to wealth ulster comes a long way third hear hear the right hon gentleman argued that there was a great disparity between the protestants of the north eastern counties and the catholics of the western counties in point of relative wealth but the right hon gentleman showed that disparity to be a great deal larger than actually exists by the system which he chose and of course he was perfectly entitled to choose his own system of calculating the relative wealth of the different counties of course to a considerable extent there is a disproportion of wealth between the north eastern and the other counties in ulster but the same disproportion exists all through ireland hear hear the eastern counties all through ireland are richer than the counties in the west if you draw a meridian line down through the whole country you will find that on the eastern side of that line there is comparative prosperity and on the western side considerable poverty hear hear the reason of this is obvious in the first place in the west the country is rocky and barren and in the second place its special trade is with england and consequently all the great distributing centres and shipping are in the east and men of business and men of wealth collect together and live on the eastern seaboard and it is only natural therefore that the eastern portions of the provinces are richer than the western portions laughter now sir we come to the question of the protection of the loyal minority i have incidentally dealt with this question in regard to the matter of education but i would ask your permission sir to say a few more words upon it as great attention has been bestowed upon the question one would think that the protestants of ireland were going to be handed over to the tender mercies of a lot of thugs and bandits major saunderson hear hear mr parnell the hon and gallant member for north armagh cheers that statement i only wish that i was as safe going to the north of ireland as the hon and gallant member would be going to the south irish and liberal cheers what do these gentlemen mean by protection of the loyal minority in the first place i would ask these gentlemen what loyal minority they mean the right hon hon sic gentleman the member for east edinburgh does not seem yet to have made up his mind as to what loyal minority he means when asked he said he meant the same loyal ulster as was referred to by the prime minister well i have examined the prime minister reference to ulster and i find that he referred to the whole province he did not select the little bit of the province in the eastern corner because the opposition had not discovered that point at the time and consequently i will assume that he refers to the whole province when he asked the house for special protection for ulster he has not however told us how he will protect them let us therefore take the plans of other gentlemen to supply the deficiency it is very confusing dealing with these plans in order to make even an outline of a plan or a patchwork of a plan you have to set together the propositions of several members laughter you have to take a little bit of a plan from one and a little bit of a plan from another and a little bit of a plan from a third in order to make one coherent whole loud laughter and even in face of all these efforts the results are very unsatisfactory cheers and laughter the right hon gentleman the member for birmingham and i suppose the right hon gentleman the member for edinburgh when the proper time comes would do the same claimed for ulster a separate legislature well sir you would not protect the protestant minority in ireland even supposing you gave a separate legislature to ulster because there are outside the province protestants cheers who would still be without that protection therefore by taking away ulster from them you would make the position of these protestants infinitely less secure cheers how would you protect the protestants of ulster irish cheers the protestants according to the last census were in the proportion of to of the catholics hear hear we have now every reason to that the protestant and catholics in ulster are about equal in number hear hear at all events however that may be the nationalists have succeeded in returning the majority of the ulster members loud irish cheers and consequently we have the nationalists in the majority in ulster renewed cheers the main reason apart from the increase of the catholic forces for this i believe to be that a large proportion of protestant nationalists voted in the closely divided constituencies in favour of ireland and returned nationalist members cheers so that you see you would still have nationalists to deal with in ulster even supposing you had an ulster legislature hear hear and cheers and the first thing an ulster legislature would do would be to unite herself with the dublin parliament and the rest of ireland loud irish and liberal cheers but sir driven away from the fiction of protestant ulster and the great majority it was only recently discovered that there did not exist this protestant ulster cheers the opponents of the bill upon this point have been compelled to take refuge in the north east corner of ulster consisting of three counties cheers well sir there again comes in the difficulty that instead of protecting the majority of the protestants of ireland by constituting a legislature in the north east corner of ulster you would abandon the majority of the protestants of ireland to their fate or sic a dublin parliament loud irish and liberal cheers seven twelfths of the protestants of ireland live outside these three northern counties and only five twelfths of the protestants live inside these three counties so that whatever way you put it you must give up this idea of protecting either a body or a majority of the protestants of ireland by the establishment of a separate legislature either in ulster or in portions of ulster cheers no sir we can not give up a single irishman cheers we want the energy the patriotism the talent and works of every irishman cheers to make this great experiment to ensure that this great experiment shall be successful hear hear the best form of government for a country i believe to be one that requires that that government shall be the resultant of what forces are in that country hear hear we cannot give away to a second legislature for a section of ireland any portion of the talent or influence of the irish protestants cheers this class the protestant class will form the most valuable element in the irish legislature of the future constituting as they will a strong minority and exercising through the first order a moderating influence upon the making of the laws we have heard of the danger of a first trial of untrained legislators in an irish parliament i regard their presence as vitally necessary to the success of this trial hear hear we want sir all creeds and all classes in ireland we cannot look upon a single irishman as not belonging to us cheers however much we recognise their ability we cannot admit that there is a single one of them too good to take part in this experiment cheers we do not blame the small proportion of protestants who feel any real fear i admit that there is a small proportion who do hear hear we have been doing our best of late to remove this fear and we shall continue to do so cheers when this bill becomes an act we shall not cease to try to conciliate such irishmen cheers no sir there is no shame or disgrace in this fear that shame and disgrace belong to right honourable gentlemen and noble lords belonging to english political parties who for selfish interests of those political parties try to stir up the almost expired embers of religious bigotry loud irish and liberal cheers ireland has never injured the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham and i do not know why he laid the strength of his powerful arm against her why like another brennus although i hope not with the same result he has thrown his sword into the scale against ireland i do not think that either politically or otherwise she has attempted to injure him and yet he and his kind seek to dash down this first cup of cold water that has been offered to our nation since the recall of lord fitzwilliam as was said in those days at the point of the dagger hear hear this settlement sir i believe will be a final settlement hear hear i have been reproached and it has been made an argument against the honesty of my declaration regarding the final character of the settlement that in a speech at wicklow i proclaimed a right to protect irish manufactures this bill gives no such right undoubtedly i did claim that right but it was not when the liberal party was in power laughter and cheers that speech about protection at wicklow was made at a time when we had every reason to know that the conservative party if they should be successful at the polls would have offered to ireland a statutory legislature with the right to protect her own affairs loud irish and ministerial cheers in which mr gladstone warmly joined and that this would have been coupled with a settlement of the irish land question upon a process of purchase on a larger scale than that now proposed by the prime minister prolonged irish and ministerial cheers i should never have thought i never did think and i do not think now of claiming a right of protection from the liberal party cheers i never expected it liberal cheers therefore i recognise this settlement as final a settlement without protection there is another argument stronger still the prime minister has shown us when he introduced this bill that without fiscal unity we should lose a year that will still go to us in consequence of this unity and the absence of protection and it is a very good quid pro quo italics for the loss of protection hear hear the question of the retention of the irish members is one which i will only touch upon very slightly i may say with regard to this matter that i have always kept my mind thoroughly open upon it hear hear it is not a vital question i have seen difficulties in it and difficulties that are rather from your point of view than from ours irish cheers i think that when considered in committee it will present a difficulty which will be a growing one for liberal members hear hear i do not desire to prejudge this question i admit a desire and a strong sentiment in the matter when however i consider how many times my colleagues and myself have been forcibly ejected laughter and how often the necessity of suspending and if not entirely abrogating the representation of ireland in this house has been eagerly canvassed by the london press as the necessary solution of the question perhaps sir i may not consider under the present circumstances that this desire on the part of the liberal members is a very reasonable one i acknowledge however that it is an honest one when the prime minister introduces his plan we can examine it it will require a little time for consideration when the prime minister has produced his plan without binding myself beforehand i shall candidly examine it with the desire to see in it elements which shall not endanger its final acceptance hear hear i shall deal with the proposals from that point of view to the permanency of the settlement and the success of it my colleagues and i have pledged our political future cheers but i confess sir that if i had regard to the spirit with which the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham has dealt with this question i should have been hopelessly alienated from the plan he has dealt with it in order to cast upon us an apparent stigma of inferiority in order he may have an excuse for constant meddling in our affairs checking and thwarting us keeping us under his thumb hear hear that is not a state of things which the irish people will submit to cheers we should not agree to his claims in this respect they would be fatal to the durability of the settlement now sir what does it all come to it comes to two alternatives when everything has been said and done the alternatives of coercion which lord salisbury has put before the country no no from the tories and loud irish and ministerial cheers and the alternative offered by the prime minister as a solution carrying with it a lasting settlement and a treaty of peace loud cheers if you reject this bill lord salisbury was right in what he said as to coercion no no and with respect to the cries of no by hon gentlemen i beg to say that you will have to resort to coercion hear hear that is not a threat on my part i would do much to prevent the necessity of a resort to coercion but i see that it will be inevitable the best intentioned radical sitting on these benches and who thinks that he never will be a party to coercion in ireland will be seen walking into the coercion lobby for drastic coercion or at the very outside pitifully abstaining we have gone through it all before and know the sort of ireland that there has been for the past five years we know that they have had coercion during those five years of a very severe and stringent character and it will require severer and more drastic coercion now you will require everything you have had during these five years i do not say it to inflame passion or awaken bitter memories you have had during these five years suspension of the habeas corpus act you have had one thousand of your fellow subjects held in prison without specific charge many of them for a long period of time and some of them for very many months without trial without your placing them on trial and i think of all these thousand persons arrested under the coercion of the late mr forster scarcely one dozen were put on their trial for any offence hear hear you have had an arms act you have had the suspension of trial by jury during these last five years you have authorised your police to enter the domiciles of your fellow subjects in ireland at any hour of the day or night and to search every part of these domiciles even the beds of the women without warrant you have fined the innocent for offences committed by the guilty you have taken power to expel aliens from the country you have revived the curfew law and the blood money of the norman conquerors you have gagged the press suppressed newspapers manufactured new crimes and offences and imposed fresh penalties all this you have done and much more in the past five years all this and more you will have to do again the provision in the bill for terminating the representation of the irish members has been very vehemently objected to and the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has said there is no half way house between separation and the maintenance of law and order in ireland by the imperial authority well sir i say with just as much belief and just as much experience as the right hon gentleman that in my judgment there is no half way house between the concession of legislative autonomy to ireland and the disenfranchisement of the country and her government as a crown colony irish cheers but sir i refuse to believe that those evil days must come i am convinced that there are sufficient number of wise and just men in this house to cause it to disregard the appeals made to passion and to pocket and to choose the better way of the prime minister a way of peace and good will amongst nations and that when the numbers in the division lobby have been told tonight it will also be told for the admiration of all future generations that england and her parliament in this nineteenth century was wise enough brave enough and generous enough to end this strife of centuries and give peace prosperity and happiness to suffering ireland loud and prolonged irish and liberal cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with loud home rule cheers said if mr speaker i intervene in the contest of giants which has been proceeding for so many days in this house in reference to this great question it is not because i suppose that that intervention is specially suitable to the moment and i certainly should not under ordinary circumstances have felt any self confidence whatever in following so able and eloquent a member of this house as the right hon gentleman the member for the eastern division of edinburgh but thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just cheers and even a man so inferior from every point of view to the right hon gentleman as i am may hope upon this occasion not to be so much behind him as usual without intending to offer any disrespect to the right hon gentleman i must say that i could not help thinking when listening to his speech that in all the lost causes which i have seen him attempting to defend cheers during many years past he was never so little effective as when contending against the bill which we hope to see read a second time to night cheers the right hon gentleman has sought i think very unfairly to cast a lurid light upon the situation by an allusion to those unhappy outrages which have occurred in kerry i join the right hon gentleman in expressing my contempt for these cowardly and disgraceful practices cheers i join him in that respect to the fullest extent neither do i say that because for months past evictions have been more numerous in kerry than in all the rest of munster taken together neither do i say that that constitutes any excuse for these outrages although it may supply us with a reason for them but when i denounce outrages i denounce them in all parts of ireland cheers whether they occur in ulster or in kerry the right hon gentleman himself is certainly free from reproach in this matter he has not joined the noble lord the member for paddington and the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham in the use of reckless language with reference to the affairs of a country which is not their country cheers for the use of which language they had not even the paltry excuse that the subject was any business of theirs or that they really feel any interest in it my colleagues have been reproached some of them in times past because they have not been very careful to look into what might be the effect of their language and the doctrine of indirect responsibility has been employed against many of them to the length of imprisonment if that doctrine had been employed against the noble lord and the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham the former of them might perhaps have pleaded as an excuse that as he himself believes in nothing and in nobody so he could not expect any great importance to be attached to his declarations cheers while the right hon gentleman might have said and very truly that he was absolutely ignorant of the situation of all the circumstances of ireland his celebrated projected visit to that country last autumn not having come off and that consequently he really did not know what would be the probable result of his language however we have the result now in one murder which has already been committed in belfast cheers i trust that in future right hon gentlemen will remember that the importance and gravity of the occurrences which may follow in ulster and these occurrences cannot well go further than outrage and assassination will depend very much upon what they say and upon the meaning which their words may convey to the minds of ulster men but certainly i do condemn these outrages in kerry and the right hon gentleman says very rightly that they must be put a stop to well so say we all loud cheers but the right hon gentleman would try to put a stop to them by the old bad method of coercion which he and his friends have been using for the last years while we say with the prime minister try the effect of his method and if kerry men then resort to outrages they will very soon find that the rest of ireland will put a stop to them loud cheers with reference to the terrible occurrence in belfast i wish to give an explanation because as usual the english newspapers have perverted for their own purposes what actually took place i was very much pained at reading that it was alleged that the disturbance arose out of an expression addressed by a catholic workman to a protestant fellow workman to the effect that in a short time none of his religious persuasion would be allowed to earn a crust of bread in ireland now that does not represent the circumstances of the occurrence as they are reported in the local newspapers what really took place was this the catholic overseer of the works found fault with the way in which an orangeman i think he was an orange workman at all events he was a protestant workman was executing the digging out of a drain the overseer said to the workman that is a nice way to dig this drain and the orangeman replied the overseer happened to be a catholic what does a papist know about digging drains laughter the overseer being irritated i will not say justly irritated because it was absurd of him to be irritated by such a remark said in reply you will never earn a crust in these works again meaning that the workman would be dismissed that is all right said the orangeman and he took up his shovel and left the works and i believe that while leaving he was assaulted by one or more of the catholic workmen ironical laughter from the opposition it is necessary to point out so difficult is it to know here what is true with regard to any irish matter hear hear and laughter from the opposition it is very important that the house should understand that the overseer remark had not a general but an individual application at the same time i am not to be taken as justifying in the slightest degree the conduct of the catholics employed in the yard now sir the right hon member for east edinburgh spoke about the sovereignty of parliament i entirely agree upon this point i entirely accept the definitions given by the under secretary of state for foreign affairs the other day we have always known since the introduction of this bill the difference between a co ordinate and a subordinate parliament and we have recognized that the legislature which the prime minister proposes to constitute is a subordinate parliament hear hear from the ministerial benches that it is not the same as grattan parliament which was co equal with the imperial parliament we understand this perfectly well undoubtedly i should have preferred the restitution of grattan parliament it would have been more in accordance with the sentiments of the irish people whose sentiments in such matters it is most important to regard but with reference to the argument that has been used against us that i am precluded from accepting this solution as a final solution because i have claimed the restitution of grattan parliament i would beg to say that i consider there are practical advantages connected with the proposed statutory body limited and subordinate to this imperial parliament as it undoubtedly will be which will render it much more useful and advantageous to the irish people than was grattan parliament and that the statutory body which the right hon gentleman proposes to constitute is much more likely to be a final settlement than grattan parliament cheers that parliament had many disadvantages in the first place it had a house of lords hear hear well we get rid of the house of lords by the constitution of the right hon gentleman it is true that in its place is put the first order a very salutary provision although i do not agree entirely as to the extent of time for which the first order is allowed to hang up a bill or as to some of the qualifications for it but these are subordinate matters ministerial cheers i say then that the first order is a very salutary provision one that will tend to prevent rash legislation and intemperate action and as to the power of the first order to hang up a bill i would rather see a measure hung up for ten years by such a body than hung up for only hours by this imperial parliament cheers i venture to express that opinion having regard to the irritation which such constant action by the imperial parliament such constant meddling and overthrowing on the part of this imperial parliament as is suggested by the right hon member for west birmingham would have on the minds of the people of ireland that would be most mischievous and dangerous and sure to prevent the settlement being regarded as final but when we are all assembled together in one chamber different sections of irishmen threshing out different subjects those causes and effects which have always come into operation in similar circumstances will be reproduced in ireland also and discussion will be relied upon for bringing about a settlement of disputed questions which we of course have like other people and the result of these two orders working together will be that those questions will be decided on a basis of compromise more or less satisfactory to both parties we feel therefore that under this bill this imperial parliament will have the ultimate supremacy and the ultimate sovereignty cheers i have already said that under this bill the house of lords of grattan parliament will not be revived but there is another great difference between grattan parliament and the legislature to be established by this bill namely that in grattan parliament the executive was divorced from the legislative body whereas the two bodies will be united under this bill cheers i think it was fox who said that there could be no perfect system of government in which the executive and the legislative bodies were not joined together in that observation i quite agree and i think that the most useful part of the bill is that in which the prime minister throws the responsibility upon the new legislature of maintaining that order in ireland without which no state and no society can exist hear hear i understand the supremacy of the imperial parliament to be this that they can interfere in the event of the powers which are conferred by this bill being abused under certain circumstances but the nationalists in accepting this bill go as i think under an honourable understanding not to abuse those powers cheers and we pledge ourselves in that respect for the irish people as far as we can pledge ourselves ironical cheers not to abuse those powers cheers and to devote our energies and our influence which we may have with the irish people to prevent those powers from being abused cheers but if those powers should be abused the imperial parliament will have at its command the force which it reserves to itself and it will be ready to intervene but only in the case of grave necessity arising cheers i believe that this is by far and away the best mode in which we can hope to settle this question you will have the real power of force in your hands and you ought to have it cheers and if abuses are committed and injustice be perpetrated you will always be able to use that force to put a stop to them you will have the power and the supremacy of parliament untouched and unimpaired just as though this bill had never been brought forward cheers we fully recognize this to be the effect of the bill cheers i now repeat what i have already said on the first reading of the measure immediately after i heard the statement of the prime minister that we look upon the provisions of the bill as a final settlement of this question and that i believe that the irish people have accepted it as such a settlement cheers and ironical cheers of course you may not believe me but my words upon that occasion have been singularly justified by the result cheers we have had this measure accepted in the sense i have indicated by all the leaders of every section of national opinion both in ireland and outside ireland hear hear it has been so accepted in the united states of america and by the irish population in that country with whose vengeance some hon members are so fond of threatening us hear hear and laughter not a single dissentient voice has been raised against this bill by any irishman murmurs of dissent from the opposition benches not by any irishman holding national opinions and i need scarcely remind the house that there are sections among irish nationalists just as much as there are even among the great conservative party hear hear and laughter i say that as far as it is possible for a nation to accept a measure cheerfully freely gladly and without reservation as a final settlement i say that the irish people have shown that they have accepted this measure in that sense cheers even the terrible irish world italics which has not been upon my side for the last five or six years says the irish race at home and abroad have signified a willingness to accept the terms of peace offered by mr gladstone and it goes on to say that a coercion measure would be regarded by them as a declaration of war loud home rule cheers and counter cheers i need scarcely say that we have not agreed with mr patrick ford during the last five or six years we strongly condemn his proposals and he returns the compliment by not agreeing with us hear hear and laughter but i take his testimony upon this point that as far as the irish people at home and in america can accept this bill they have done so without any reservation whatever in a final sense cheers i will now leave the question of the supremacy of the imperial parliament and i will turn to one that was strongly dwelt upon by the right hon gentleman the member for edinburgh i mean the influence which he fears the irish priesthood will seek to exercise upon the future education of the irish people i may say at once that i am quite sure that the right hon gentleman apprehensions upon this subject are genuine and that at the same time he has no desire to fan the flame of religious discord hear hear on the whole i think that the right hon gentleman has spoken very fairly in reference to this part of the question and i will not say that perhaps as a protestant had i not had as i have had abundant experience of ireland i might not have been inclined to share his fears myself it is however a remarkable fact that in reference to this branch of the question the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham has actually proposed to give the entire control of irish education to a central council sitting in dublin without any reservation whatever as regards ulster or the irish protestant population hear hear it is very hard to please everybody and while we please the right hon member for west birmingham by agreeing to give the control of irish education to a legislative body which will include representatives of the protestants of ulster we find that we are unfortunately running foul of the right hon member for edinburgh hear hear and laughter i can however assure the latter right hon gentleman that we irishmen shall be able to settle this question of irish education very well among ourselves hear hear there are many liberal nationalists in ireland who do not altogether share the views of the roman catholic church upon the subject of education and they are anxious that ulster should remain an integral part of ireland in order that they may share the responsibility of government and may influence that government by the feelings which they have with regard to this question of education hear hear you may depend upon it that in an irish legislature ulster with such representatives as she now has in the imperial parliament would be able to successfully resist the realization of any idea which the roman catholic hierarchy might entertain with regard to obtaining an undue control of irish education hear hear but i repeat that we shall be able to settle this question and others very satisfactorily to all the parties concerned among ourselves hear hear i may however remind the house that things are going on in this house with reference to denominational education which would undoubtedly result in denominational education being conceded to ireland within a very few years without any effective control over it being given to the ulster protestants hear hear mention has been made of the linen trade of ireland and some correspondence on the subject has been read i have not had the advantage of reading that correspondence but it appears to me to go to the extent of declaring that the linen trade of ireland has been a curse to ulster as it has been the means not perhaps directly but indirectly of enabling the peasantry to pay the rackrents sic of the landlords who otherwise could not have obtained them hear and a laugh there did not however appear to be an inclination on the part of the right hon gentleman in dealing with the subject to carry it very far i observe that there had been a similar reticence exercised with regard to the financial question of which such a point was made upon the first reading of the bill hear hear the speech of the right hon gentleman upon the first reading of the bill undoubtedly produced a great sensation in this country the right hon gentleman as i and others and as i believe the country understood him argued on that occasion that ulster was wealthier than either of the three other provinces and that consequently the burden of taxation would chiefly fall upon her and that without ulster therefore it would be impossible to carry on the government of ireland the right hon gentleman did not press the financial question very far to day but it would not be improper perhaps if we were to direct a little more of our attention to it hear hear for instance the great wealth of ulster has been taken up as the war cry of the loyal and patriotic union the right hon gentleman was not very fair in choosing the income tax schedule d referring to trade and professions as his standard of the relative wealth of the four provinces the fair measure of their relative wealth is their assessment to the income tax under all the different schedules and also the value of the rateable property in ireland and these tests show conclusively that so far from ulster being the wealthiest of the four provinces and the right hon gentleman does not deny it now ulster comes third in point of relative wealth per head of the population she comes after leinster and munster and she is only superior to impoverished connaught hear hear the income tax for leinster shows 6s 9d per head munster 0s 7d per head ulster 14s 9d per head and connaught 13s 7d per head these figures will give the relative wealth of the four provinces as ascertained by these the only fair tests as for leinster for munster for ulster or little more than half the relative wealth of leinster and for connaught and if you take any other fair test the same results will be arrived at and you will find that ulster instead of being first on the list as regards wealth per head comes a long way third but the right hon gentleman also argued that there was a great disparity between the north eastern or protestant counties of ulster and the catholic counties in point of relative wealth he chose not the fairest test but the test that showed the best results for his argument and he represented the disparity as a great deal larger than that which actually exists but undoubtedly to a considerable extent there is this disproportion between the relative wealth of the north eastern counties of ulster and the other counties of the province but that same disproportion exists all through ireland hear hear the eastern counties are universally the richer counties all over ireland if you draw a meridian line down through the centre of the country you will find to the east of that line comparative prosperity and to the west of it considerable poverty in the first place the country becomes rocky and barren as you go west and in the second place the chief trade centres and consequently the great distributing centres the shipping ports and other places where men of business and wealth congregate and find their living exist on the eastern seaboard and it is only natural not only as regards ulster but munster and leinster that the eastern portions are richer than the rest hear hear i come next to the question of the protection of the minority i have incidentally dwelt on this point in respect to the matter of education but i should like with the permission of the house to say a few words more about it because it is one on which great attention has been bestowed one would think from what we hear that the protestants of ireland were going to be handed over to the tender mercies of a set of thugs and bandits hear hear and laughter the hon and gallant member for north armagh cheers that i only wish that i was as safe in the north of ireland when i go there as the hon and gallant member would be in the south home rule cheers what do hon gentlemen mean by the protection of the loyal minority in the first place i ask them what they mean by the loyal minority the right hon member for east edinburgh does not seem to have made up his mind even at this late stage of discussion as to what loyal ulster he means when asked the question he said he meant the same loyal ulster as was referred to by the prime minister in his speech but he would not commit himself by telling us what signification he attributed to the prime minister expression well i have examined the prime minister reference since then and i find that he referred to the whole province of ulster hear hear he did not select a little bit of the province because the opposition had not discovered this point at that time a laugh and consequently i suppose i may assume that the right hon member for east edinburgh also referred to the whole province of ulster when he asked for special protection for it but we may go to other sources to supply that deficiency it is one of the features of this debate that in order to make up the patchwork of a plan you have to go round to the opposition speakers and select a bit from one and a bit from another and a bit from a third to frame something like a programme in opposition to the proposal of the prime minister and even then the results are very unsatisfactory but the right hon member for west birmingham has claimed for ulster and i suppose that the right hon member for east edinburgh when the proper time comes will support him in that claim a separate legislature for the province of ulster well sir you would not protect the loyal minority of ireland even supposing that you gave a separate legislature to the province of ulster because there are outside the province of ulster over protestants who would still be without any protection so far as you propose to give them protection you would make the position of these protestants by taking away ulster from them infinitely less secure but you would not even protect the protestants in ulster because the protestants according to the last census were in the proportion of to catholics and we have every reason to believe that now the protestants and catholics in ulster are about equal in number at all events however that may be the nationalists have succeeded in returning the majority of the ulster members home rule cheers and consequently we have the nationalists in a majority in ulster the main reason of the balance of forces i believe to be that a large proportion of the protestant nationalists voted in the closely divided constituencies of ulster in favour of my hon colleagues so that you would have the nationalist will to deal with in ulster even if ulster had a separate legislature and the very first thing that the ulster legislature would do would be to unite itself with the dublin parliament hear hear well being driven away from the fiction of protestant ulster and the great majority of protestants which until recently was alleged to exist in ulster the opponents of this bill seek refuge in the north east corner of ulster consisting of three counties here again comes in the difficulty that instead of protecting the majority of the protestants of ireland by constituting a legislature for the north east corner of ulster you would abandon the majority of the protestants of ireland to their fate under a dublin parliament seven twelfths of the protestants of ireland live outside these three counties so that you must give up the idea of protecting the protestants either as a body or as a majority by the establishment of a separate legislature either in ulster or in any portion of ulster hear hear no sir we cannot give up a single irishman home rule cheers we want the energy the patriotism the talents and the work of every irishman to insure sic that this great experiment shall be a successful one the best system of government for a country i believe to be one which requires that that government should be the resultant of all the forces within that country cheers we cannot give way to a second legislature the talents and influence of any portion or section of the irish people the class of protestants will form a most valuable element in the irish legislature of the future constituting as they will a strong minority and exercising through the first order a moderating influence in making the laws hear hear we have heard of the danger that will result from an untried and unpractised legislature being established in ireland now i regard variety as vitally necessary for the success of this trial we want all creeds and all classes in ireland we cannot consent to look upon a single irishman as not belonging to us and however much we recognize the great abilities and the industry of the irish protestants and we recognize them freely and fully we cannot admit that there is a single one of them too good to take part in the dublin parliament we do not blame the small proportion of the protestants of ireland who feel any real fear i admit sir that there is a small proportion of them who do feel this fear we do not blame them we have been doing our best to allay that fear and we shall continue to do so hear hear and finally when this bill becomes an act we shall not cease from the work of conciliating the fears of this small section of irishmen no sir theirs is not the shame and disgrace of this fear that shame and disgrace belong to the right hon gentlemen and noble lords of english political parties who for selfish interests have sought to rekindle the embers the almost expiring embers of religious bigotry ministerial and home rule cheers ireland has never injured the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham i do not know why he should have added the strength of his powerful arm why he should like another brennus let us hope not with the same result why he should have thrown his sword into the scale against ireland i am not aware that we have either personally or politically attempted to injure the right hon gentleman yet he and his kind seek to dash this cup from the lips of the irish people the first cup of cold water that has been offered to our nation since the recall of lord fitzwilliam hear this settlement i believe will be a final settlement ministerial and home rule cheers i have been reproached and it has been made an argument against the honesty of my declaration as to the final character of the settlement that i have claimed the right of protecting irish manufactures and it is said that this bill gives no such right well undoubtedly i claimed that right but it was not when a liberal government was in power home rule cheers that speech about protection at wicklow was made at a time when we had every reason to know that the conservative party if they should be successful at the polls would have offered ireland a statutory legislature with a right to protect her own industries loud and continued cheering by ministerialists and home rulers and that this would have been coupled with the settlement of the irish land question on the basis of purchase on a larger scale than that now proposed by the prime minister loud ministerial and home rule cheers i never should have thought of claiming protection from the liberal party and therefore i recognize the settlement as final without protection there is another and stronger argument as well in introducing this bill the prime minister showed that unless we have fiscal unity there will be a loss of i think therefore that as a consequence of fiscal unity is a good quid pro quo italics for the loss of protection the question of the retention of the irish members i shall only touch upon very slightly i have always desired to keep my mind thoroughly open upon it and not to make it a vital question there are difficulties but they are rather more from the english than the irish point of view and i think that when we come to consider the question in committee that feeling will be a growing one on the part of liberal members i admit the existence of a strong sentiment in favour of our retention i will not say it is a reasonable sentiment when i consider how many times my colleagues and i have been forcibly ejected from this house home rule cheers how often the necessity of suspending if not entirely abrogating representation on the part of ireland has been eagerly canvassed by the london press as the only necessary solution of it perhaps i may not under these circumstances consider the desire on the part of liberal members as a very reasonable one i admit that it is an honest one all i can say is that when the prime minister has produced his plan and i admit that it is a difficult question and will require some little time for consideration when the prime minister has produced his plan without binding myself beforehand i shall candidly examine it with a desire not to see in it an element that will injure the permanency of the settlement i shall chiefly deal with it with a view of seeing whether it will diminish the permanency of the settlement to the success of which my colleagues and i have pledged our political future home rule cheers but i confess sir that if i had regard to the spirit with which the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham has dealt with this question i should have been hopelessly alienated from the plan of retaining the irish members he has dealt with it in a way to attach an apparent stigma of inferiority to us and in order that he may have the excuse for constantly meddling in our affairs checking us thwarting us and keeping us under his thumb the irish people will never submit to that loud home rule cheers we could not agree to his scheme what does it all come to it comes to two alternatives when everything has been said and everything has been done one alternative is the coercion which lord salisbury put before the country ministerial cheers and the other is the alternative offered by the prime minister carrying with it the lasting settlement of a treaty of peace home rule cheers that is not a threat on my part i would do much to prevent the necessity for resorting to coercion but i say it will be inevitable and the best intentioned radical who sits on those benches and who thinks that he never never will be a party to coercion will be found soon walking into the division lobby in favour of the strongest and most drastic coercion bill or at the very outside pitifully abstaining we have gone through it all before loud home rule cheers during the last five years i know sir there have been very severe and drastic coercion bills but it will require an even severer and more drastic measure of coercion now you will require all that you have had during the last five years and more besides what sir has that coercion been you have had sir during those five years i do not say this to inflame passion you have had during those five years the suspension of the habeas corpus act you have had a thousand of your irish fellow subjects held in prison without specific charge many of them for long periods of time some of them for months without trial and without any intention of placing them on trial i think of all these thousand persons arrested under the coercion act of the late mr forster scarcely a dozen were put on their trial you have had the arms act you have had the suspension of trial by jury all during the last five years you have authorized your police to enter the domicile of a citizen of your fellow subject in ireland at any hour of the day or night and to search every part of this domicile even the beds of the women without warrant you have fined the innocent for offences committed by the guilty you have taken power to expel aliens from this country you have revived the curfew law and the blood money of your norman conquerors you have gagged the press and seized and suppressed newspapers you have manufactured new crimes and offences and applied fresh penalties unknown to your laws for these crimes and offense all this you have done for five years and all this and much more you will have to do again hear hear the provision in the bill for terminating the representation of irish members has been very vehemently objected to and the right hon gentleman the member for the border burghs has said that there is no half way house between separation and the maintenance of law and order in ireland by imperial authority i say with just as much sincerity of belief and just as much experience as the right hon gentleman that in my judgment there is no halfway house between the concession of legislative autonomy to ireland and the disenfranchisement of the country and her government as a crown colony ministerial and home rule cheers but sir i refuse to believe that these evil days must come i am convinced there are a sufficient number of wise and just members in this house to cause it to disregard appeals made to passion and to choose the better way of founding peace and good will among nations and when the numbers in the division lobby come to be told it will also be told for the admiration of all future generations that england and her parliament in this nineteenth century was wise enough brave enough and generous enough to close the strife of centuries and to give peace and prosperity to suffering ireland loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell asked the prime minister to consider the position in which irish members would be placed if the matter were left in this indefinite way let him try and place himself in the position of an irish member representing a constituency to whom this question was a matter of vital importance they were utterly unable and dare not try the risk of leaving this matter unsettled they had already done their best to find a day and there was none possibly available for this purpose earlier than the 21st of july if the bill were postponed till then it would be utterly impossible to pass it into law this year even with all the assistance that her majesty government might desire to give it both in that house and elsewhere therefore if they lost their present opportunity of taking the opinion of the house of commons they might never get another the prime minister promised that there should be no delay in announcing the intentions of the government that was not a very large promise the house was entitled to have not merely the opinion of the government on the merits of the bill but also an opportunity for fully and fairly discussing the question that was all they asked could not the prime minister say he would give them a few hours upon some government night after some other business had been dealt with the position of the right hon gentleman entitled him to the excuse that he had not had time to make himself acquainted with the provisions of this very short one clause bill but the engagements of the two irish law officers were not of such a nature as to justify the excuse that they had not had time fully to examine the effect of the bill on the land act of and to advise the responsible minister of the crown as to the course to be adopted the prime minister seemed to think that they might do more mr gladstone i expressed no opinion he thought he heard from the ministerial bench a suggestion that they might do more than they had done it was very necessary that the house should understand the exact scope of the bill it did not pretend to be a settlement of the irish land question or to forestall in any way the right of the government to consider this question in all its branches and to bring forward their views in a future session according to their promise it simply proposed to remove a matter which was pressing with intense severity upon at least out of the tenant farmers of ireland and it also supplied a valuable addition to the irish land act that act permitted the chairman to award compensation in cases of disturbance under section section limited that discretion in respect of evictions for non payment of rent and provided that such evictions should not be treated as disturbances unless he could certify that the rent was exorbitant they now desired to deal with a large number of intermediate cases between the case of an exorbitant rent and what anybody might consider to be a fair rent cases which were brought into especial prominence from the stringency of the present times and to give the chairman a discretionary power to award compensation where he thought fit nothing more than that was contemplated by the bill and nothing more than that could be found by anybody in it the discretionary power of the chairman under the 18th section was left in the fullest extent and they did not interfere with it in the slightest degree he would ask the house to notice the latter part of that 18th section which provided that if it should appear to the court that the landlord has been and is willing to permit the tenant to continue in the occupation of his holding upon just and reasonable terms that the tenant claim for compensation shall then be dissolved this bill would not fine a landlord who ejected his tenant for non payment of a fair and reasonable rent it only sought to complete the discretionary power in the hands of the court and which was actually originally intended to be given by this very land act the bill sought to supply a most valuable method of peace preservation and he really would ask the government to consider whether they could not in addition to what they had already said promise that they would afford the house an early opportunity of expressing its opinion on the principle of this measure\n",

      "mr parnell said he did not intend to make more than a few observations on this question it was he believed a very important subject as regarded the means of allaying one of the mischiefs attendant on the present connection between the two countries rather than as indicating any new remedies for the evils which undoubtedly existed the hon member for dungarvan mr o'donnell had rather misunderstood a suggestion made by his hon and learned friend when he said that he advocated the presence of the law officers of the crown in that house he did not go so far with his hon and learned friend as to advocate their presence there but merely to say that as they were there and as they did not seem to have any ostensible employment it might be just as well to give them something to do by handing over to them one or more of the irish offices he recollected that two or three years ago the chief secretary made a very able speech which produced a very great impression in that house utterly demolishing a motion moved by the hon member for county cork mr shaw calling attention to the desirability of the restoration of the irish parliament and asking for an inquiry into that subject at that time the right hon gentleman did not probably know as much about irish affairs as he now knew but he effectually disposed of that motion very much to his own satisfaction at any rate by pointing out that the consequence of that motion would involve a change in the constitution of this country he thought that the right hon gentleman would find that a persistence in the present attempt to govern ireland by a centralization system through dublin castle would involve a very much greater change in the constitution of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland than the proposition then made by the hon member for cork and he would find also that it would be impossible even with all the attempts at patchwork from time to time for the purpose of propping up this system of government to persist in it for many years to come now they had at last a statesman as chief secretary for ireland and he was sure that the conviction would force itself upon him more and more every day that the task which he had undertaken was an impossible one and that he would have a greater satisfaction than he had ever obtained from the administration of his office when he handed it over to some secretary of state chosen by the people who should sit in their own parliament in dublin\n",

      "mr parnell inasmuch as he felt sure the right hon gentleman the chief secretary was anxious to proceed with the belief of distress ireland act amendment bill did not wish to intrude at any length he merely wished to say that the invitation of the hon member for glasgow mr anderson would certainly be accepted so far as he was concerned he thought irish members had made a mistake in not approaching the unequal incidence of the taxation in england and in ireland with a definite intention in the late parliament the hon members for galway mr mitchell henry and youghal sir joseph m'kenna occasionally directed attention in their usual able way to this unequal incidence in his mr parnell's opinion those hon gentlemen committed a mistake in that they brought forward abstract motions for experience showed that it took a very long time for abstract motions to ripen a question sufficiently for decision how often did the hon member for leicester mr p a taylor take up the subject of flogging in this way and it was not until the case was taken up in a more practical way by the examination of details of government bills and by serving amendments to those bills that the question was solved successfully if irish members would follow that example and joined by the scotch members would press their grievances in the form of amendments to the budget bill in its various stages then they would probably receive more attention from the responsible minister of the crown than those grave grievances received when advanced under the form of an abstract motion it had been proved over and over again that foreign alcohol was taxed at the rate of 6d only for degrees of strength while native alcohol paid 2s for the same strength it was sometimes said this was done to induce the working man to drink claret in preference to stronger drinks but he did not believe that the object really was to obtain from france more favourable terms for the admission of our manufactured articles this was a course that worked a special injustice in ireland there were no important manufactures and so it amounted to this that rich prosperous england was benefited at the expense of impoverished ireland it worked in this way although the relative wealth of ireland as represented by her income tax paying population in proportion to that of england was as to ireland paid in contributions to the imperial exchequer a proportion of in this was manifestly unjust and it was no answer to say that the article of whisky was taxed the same in all parts of the united kingdom for it was not fair to throw the incidence of taxation on a particular article which was produced in two small portions of the united kingdom and not in the larger portions of the united kingdom according to the duties levied at present the rich englishman who drank his champagne paid only 2d a bottle in the shape of duty while the poor scotchman or irishman not that the latter were in the position to do so now a days who drank whisky paid duty at the rate of 2d per glass instead of the bottle\n",

      "mr parnell said he was sorry to see that the first act of the new solicitor general for ireland mr w m johnson was to make an obstructive motion to the progress of an irish measure of assimilation if there was one principle to which the present government were pledged it was that of assimilating the irish and english law the bill of the hon member for kildare had been brought forward to redress an admitted inequality in the english and irish law of registration under the old law the county court judges were not compelled to hold revision courts except in a certain number of places it was found that these places were not convenient and that the number of courts were far too few for the purpose of affording facilities to those persons entitled by law to obtain the franchise and the lord lieutenant was empowered to direct that extraordinary revision sessions should be held but in practice the lord lieutenant did not make these provisions although his hon friend hoped that the present lord lieutenant would be better in that re respect than his predecessor formerly under the old law the onus was thrown upon the lord lieutenant of providing additional facilities but it was asked under the present bill that the onus might be thrown upon the lord lieutenant of preventing additional facilities being granted and he and his hon friends could not but consider the request a very reasonable one he was surprised that the solicitor general for ireland had objected to that very reasonable request if the hon and learned gentleman would allow him to correct his statement he would say that although he had mentioned the number of polling places in county cork as amounting to he mr parnell had had the very best opportunities for knowing that they numbered he would ask the solicitor general for ireland whether under all the circumstances of the case he ought to oppose a clause of this kind no notice of objection had been given and they had not been informed of the reasons of the government or the solicitor general for ireland he was sure the hon and learned gentleman would see on consideration that opposition to the clause was unnecessary mr parnell said that perhaps the proper way to settle this question would be to follow precedent everyone must wish to avoid inflicting unnecessary expense upon the ratepayers of ireland every irishman went to chapel once a year and probably a great majority once a week but very few irishmen probably went to the police barrack at all during that time if they wished to publish the information in the lists in the most efficient way it seemed to him it would be by affixing these notices on the churches and chapels he should be in favour of adopting a compromise in this matter by striking out the police barracks and market places and leaving the churches and chapels he did not think that that could be done then for the question put from the chair would probably be that the clause stand part of the bill\n",

      "mr parnell i wish sir first of all to say that i have not the slightest sympathy with the question of my hon friend the member for dungarvan at the same time the rules of this house i do not express an opinion or venture to argue whether it is right or wrong permit members of this house who are disatisfied with the answer to a question they have received from ministers to refer to the question and express their dissatisfaction and in order to put themselves in order they may conclude with a motion the hon member for dungarvan has adopted that course and i submit to you sir and to this house that in adopting that course which may be and undoubtedly is an inconvenient one he was only doing that which a select committee of this house on public business appointed to consider how the public business of this house might be best conducted distinctly refused to interfere with and you sir in your evidence before that committee refused to recommend an interference with it i think that under all those circumstances the same privilege should be accorded to the hon member for dungarvan as has always been accorded to members of this house on every occasion to the meanest members of this house i think it is the first time that a minister of the crown the prime minister the highest minister of the crown has set the evil and dangerous example of endeavouring by a resolution given without notice in an attempt to ward off by a party and ill advised step what no doubt may seem to the prime minister to be a great evil i say that it is the first time that a minister of the crown has attempted to silence a member of this house in this way now sir i have expressed my disagreement with the question of the hon member for dungarvan i deeply regret that he should have put it i think it was an ill advised and ill judged question but you sir when you were appealed to on the point of order stated that you could not interfere and that you must leave the responsibility with the hon member for dungarvan belonging as i do to a minority of members in this house who must always remain a minority belonging to a minority which has not the ordinary advantages which other members of this house have of being able to appeal to the public opinion of the country in which this house conducts its deliberations i see the enormous importance and the danger of the innovation which is now sought to be made and in behalf of freedom of speech i would entreat this house not to take any hasty step or action in this matter but to consent to the adjournment of the debate in order to see whether on the one hand reflection will not induce the hon member for dungarvan to withdraw his question from the notice paper and on the other hand whether the prime minister may not consider that he is founding a dangerous precedent and one which at some time or other may be fatal to freedom of speech in this house i beg mr speaker to move the adjournment of the debate mr parnell said the prime minister motion had been directed against the right to discuss a question on a sudden motion for the adjournment of the house no he was forced to the conviction that the prime minister chief objection to the motion of the hon member for dungarvan was that the hon gentleman had raised a debate without giving notice to the person whose conduct was impugned the right hon gentleman said that the love of fair play should have prevented the hon member for dungarvan from attacking an absent man without notice and at the same time the prime minister expressed his willingness to discuss the very delicate question with regard to this ambassador if the hon member for dungarvan would bring it forward in the usual way by giving a notice of motion mr parnell the chief secretary for ireland said they were anxious to debate the question if notice were given of it how then could it be said that the action of the government to night was taken in order to prevent a grave public disadvantage it was taken for the same reasons which prompted the action of the late government when the member for mayo mr o'connor power was bringing forward a motion relating to the distress in ireland the speaker then expressed disapproval of the course which was being adopted in almost the identical terms in which he had to night disapproved of the course pursued by the hon member for dungarvan the then chancellor of the exchequer rose in his place but did not move the motion which the prime minister had made this evening indeed the late chancellor of the exchequer rather bungled the matter the right hon gentleman raised a point of order and it was subsequently found that the only member who was not out of order was the hon member for mayo if the late chancellor of the exchequer had moved the resolution which the prime minister submitted that night the house of commons would have endorsed it by a far larger majority than would vote against the motion now under consideration this must show hon members the necessity of carefully guarding their proceedings against the imputation of undue haste if they placed the proprieties of the house absolutely in the hands of the prime minister they would be giving him whatever might be his temper and character a power that might be turned to very undesirable account he himself disliked the question of the hon member for dungarvan but he did not think the chief secretary and home secretary should have sought to enlist the passions of the house against the hon gentleman he could not agree to the doctrine laid before them by the home secretary that there were questions of which the house of commons could forbid the discussion because he failed to see the principles which supported this conclusion undoubtedly the present prime minister could be trusted with a great deal of power but even he should not be intrusted with more power than could be taken away from him in the circumstances he would ask the prime minister whether much might not be gained by adjourning this discussion to a time when they would all be in good humour when a minority of the house was driven to put its back against the wall it did not usually happen that the house of commons emerged from the trial with added laurels and he would ask the prime minister whether it would not be better without prejudging the question to agree to an adjournment of the house\n",

      "mr parnell said he confessed that he did not see how they could discuss the question of the relief of distress in ireland within the narrow limits now proposed to be assigned to it by the bill now before the house in the judgment of all those who had lived longest in ireland and had most carefully considered the condition of the people of that country it always had been apparent that the main cause of periodical famines there was the condition of irish land tenure it would therefore be a matter of practical impossibility for the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland by the adoption of the course which he had now announced namely the withdrawal of the clause notice of which the right hon gentleman had given a day or two ago to limit the discussion of the question within the very narrow limits he proposed it would be his mr parnell's duty to move certain clauses which would put the question of this distress in ireland upon its proper footing before the country they had too long been told that distress in ireland proceeded from the laziness and want of thrift of the irish people they had been too long in the habit of appearing before the nations of the world as beggars for charity and there were many people in fact the majority of the people of ireland who now thought that the time had come when this practice should cease and that they should have the opportunity of living in their own country and of obtaining prosperity from the natural riches and resources of the country an opportunity which the laws of england had denied them for so long a period what was wanted by the irish people was not so much that they should be relieved from the necessities produced by famine out of imperial funds as that they should be put in a position to manage their own business by an irish parliament instead of being subject as was the case under the last parliament to alien legislation what was the bill of the present government it was a bill which simply sought to carry ought the policy of the predecessors of the present government a policy which consigned people to death by starvation what were the steps taken by the late government the house would recollect that distress in ireland had been predicted by those best acquainted with the circumstances of the country and publicly predicted during the last months it was in the may of that public attention first came to be directed to the probability the extreme probability that the wet season would produce suffering in many of the western portions of ireland these complaints were made publicly and how were they answered by the late government he found that up to january the only answer given by the government to the pressing needs of the country was the arrest of mr michael davitt and others upon the trumped up charge of sedition a charge which in the ordinary course of law the government should have prosecuted but in this instance they shrank from doing so it was not until the middle of november that the treasury on the application of the lord lieutenant authorized the commissioners of public works in ireland to lend money to owners of land or in other words it was not until the middle of november that the government took the first step to stave off the distress which was then in full swing they issued a circular under date of 22nd november and on the 12th of january there was a fresh notice amending the former one and offering loans on still more favourable conditions these loans were offered to landlords and to sanitary authorities for the execution of works of employment and also for the purpose of executing works which sanitary authorities could execute under the acts authorizing their existence it was now found by the report just issued by the dublin mansion house committee the chief charitable association in ireland that the net result of all the exertions of the late and of the present governments had been the employment of people on works of relief out of who were in want and at what expenditure was this infinitesimal result arrived at the act of last session authorized a loan out of the irish church fund of the whole of that loan had been drawn out nay more it had been largely exceeded so that the present government were obliged to come to parliament for fresh powers by which they sought by the bill under notice to make an additional advance of notwithstanding that the whole of the loan authorized by the act of last session had been largely exceeded it was found that up to the present the result was that employment had only been found for out of persons who were in want such a fact alone was sufficient to condemn the bill now before the house and if they really wanted to relieve distress in ireland they must go further than the limit of the bill proposed the chief provisions of the present measure were the advance by the irish church temporalities commissioners of another for the purposes of loans to the owners of land in ireland power was given to the commissioners of public works with the consent of the treasury to make loans to railway and other public companies having borrowing powers upon the security of baronial guarantees given by extraordinary presentment sessions and a small grant was to be given of for fishery piers with regard to the proposal of doubling the grant to the owners of land in ireland he failed to find the slightest justification for such a course as regarded the ostensible purpose of the bill the relief of distress in ireland he failed to see on what grounds the government now came to ask parliament for a fresh application of for such a useless undertaking if the government had shown that the application of the money already spent was of any advantage or that any appreciable portion of it had reached those who were really in distress he could then have understood their contention or if they had been able to show that any proportion of the money which they now asked from parliament was likely to reach the really destitute he could understand their application but as the government had not professed that this money was to be used for the relief of distress or that a very small and almost appreciable portion of it was likely to be applied for that purpose he thought the house would not be doing its duty if it sanctioned the diversion of money for such an object by the latest information they had not however received very late information on the subject from the chief secretary for ireland it appeared that about had been issued to owners of land in ireland how much of that sum had probably reached the persons who were in distress they could not assume that out of issued in that way more than two thirds or one half had actually been expended because it was obvious that the expenditure of a sum of money for that purpose must take a considerable time but assuming that two thirds of which was a very liberal estimate had been actually expended by the landlords who had received it how much of those two thirds had probably reached the hands of the people who were in want of bread works of improvement which were easily undertaken by owners of land in ireland required a considerable expenditure in skilled labour and material iron timber portland cement lime drainage tiles and so forth had to be purchased masons carpenters slaters and other skilled mechanics had to be employed and paid high wages it would not therefore be an unreasonable assumption to state that of expended by the landlords not more than half or had as yet been expended in wages for unskilled labour of the it would be a very liberal assumption to say that up to the present time only one half had been applied to the relief of the people who were in actual distress these relief works were scattered all over the country the noble lord the secretary to the treasury lord frederick cavendish had stated that of the numerous applications made by landlords in the scheduled districts only had been refused they might then fairly assume from information which he mr parnell had received from those who had a knowledge of the facts that the works set on foot were not so far at any rate as the majority of them were concerned in localities where distressed persons could obtain employment therefore he was fully justified in reducing the sum to one half namely to there was another objection to the principle of granting money to owners of land apart entirely from the useless ness of the application so far as the relief of actual distress was concerned landowners in many eases used the money lent to them as a leverage to obtain the payment of rents from then tenants it was worked in this way the tenants who could not pay rent were he had heard informed that unless they paid it no works of improvement would be executed on their farms and those tenants who did pay were favoured in comparison with those who could not pay and if the latter were employed they were told that they would have to give back in the shape of rent the money they received for their labour mr parnell said he was speaking generally of scheduled districts and he could not then give particular instances it was obvious that one of the chief designs of the late government was not to relieve the distressed but to relieve landlords who could not obtain their rents with the same celerity as formerly they could he had no doubt that the leverage had been used and would be used again to a considerable extent a further objection to the proposal of her majesty government was that this sum of was to be taken out of the irish church fund that application he considered to be in direct contradiction of the statute as that fund was the only one which was available for many purposes in ireland it was exceedingly hard that the government should seize upon that fund to provide against the consequences of an occurrence which was the result of the neglect of parliament in years past they might fairly ask what was the necessity for such an appropriation of the fund the security for the repayment of the sum to be advanced was unimpeachable all former loans for the improvement of irish land had been duly repaid and why therefore should not this loan be advanced by the imperial exchequer and the irish church fund be left for purposes which might obtain the sanction of the majority of the irish constituencies then again the church commissioners had no capital they had only an annual income and in order to make advances were obliged to borrow sometimes from the savings banks in this case he understood they would have to borrow from the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt the money was to be borrowed at 3½per cent and was to be lent to the landowners at percent so that there would be an annual loss to the fund of 2½ per cent and that for a period of years would amount to if they agreed to take the money from the imperial exchequer would it not be a fair and generous thing at least to lend the money at the same rate as it was proposed that it should be borrowed he believed the calculated surplus of the irish church fund was only about at the present time and the proposed charge of would reduce it to it was therefore obvious that the utility of the fund in any future emergency was very much impaired it appeared to him that the ultimate loss to the fund would be avoided by the course he suggested and he had reason to believe that the matter was so important that if a concession were made on that point the opposition to the government proposals would he believed be very much diminished the next provision of the bill was one by which power was given to the commissioners of public works with the consent of the treasury to make loans to railway companies and other companies in having borrowing powers on the security of baronial guarantees obtained at extraordinary presentment sessions that clause might shortly be described as the railway clause of the bill and he could not imagine how the chief secretary for ireland could have been induced to pitchfork so to speak these clauses into the bill if he had given the subject proper consideration under the present law railway companies before coming to parliament for their bills were entitled to apply to baronial sessions for a guarantee up to the presentment of baronial sessions and the fiat of a grand jury were the only conditions requisite for the purpose of obtaining a guarantee but in the house of commons in order to prevent the misuse of the grants and to provide certain local checks and guarantees against jobbery adopted a standing order by which the consent of as many local bodies as possible should be obtained before the railway companies could get a guarantee and in addition to the baronial presentment it became necessary that the consent of a board of guardians should be obtained before the guarantee could be granted thus they had first of all the check provided by the necessary consent of the board of guardians secondly the presentment of the baronial sessions of the associated cesspayers third the grand jury finding and fourth the power possessed by the rate and cesspayers to traverse the presentment before a judge at assizes thus there were four distinct cheeks provided by the legislature in order to prevent abuse and although they had been found insufficient for their purpose yet the clauses of the right hon gentleman proposed to sweep away those checks at one blow and to introduce a variety of other changes by the proposed clauses the lord lieutenant could call an extraordinary presentment sessions and then a railway company which had previously failed in obtaining its baronial guarantee which had gone before parliament and obtained its acts and had been granted powers on condition that the whole of its capital should be subscribed and one half of it paid up could now come forward and obtain a baronial guarantee without any check or hindrance from the extraordinary baronial presentment sessions convened by the lord lieutenant and without having to fulfil any of the conditions provided by the legislature as to capital in other words the company which had been unable to obtain its presentment before and which had been unable to obtain a 6d of capital or even its expense could come forward and levy black mail by casting itself on the unprotected ratepayers and obtain a guarantee for its own advantage and benefit before he left the railway companies he wanted to point out that the power which was to be granted by the legislature might act in a very unexpected manner and in a way not at all intended by the promoters of the bill there was nothing in the clauses as they at present stood to prevent any of the great railway companies in ireland such as the great southern and western the dublin wicklow and wexford railway the midland great northern and others with plenty of means for obtaining capital for the prosecution of any work which was likely to pay there was nothing to prevent them from enlarging their resources by obtaining baronial guarantee under the provisions of the bill for the maintaining a branch line which could not possibly pay directly but which might be of indirect value to the line and which might act as a feeder to traffic on the main line but be a work which at present and for all time hereafter would necessarily be a burden on the ratepayers with respect to the interest on the capital raised in the construction of the works there were many branch lines which could be made which would be very useful to the main line and which would probably pay indirectly but which would never pay back directly any portion of the capital used in their construction and there was nothing in the clause to prevent companies such as those he had described from obtaining guarantees from the baronial sessions in the summary manner provided for then again the provisions with regard to public companies was one of a very extraordinary character everything which he had said in regard to the rail way companies applied to the public companies and any bubble company sprung up in london australia or anywhere else provided they could obtain an act of parliament giving them borrowing powers without the subscription of a farthing of capital could go to ireland and obtain a baronial guarantee and carry on works at the expense of the starving ratepayers of ireland he now came to the consideration of the question whether the clauses were likely to carry out at all the objects for which they were introduced they had been told that there were railways in ireland running directly through the distressed districts which if works in connection with them were commenced would give employment to the people by the erection of the earthworks necessary he asked the house to consider whether the clauses proposed would be effectual in the carrying out of the object his own belief based upon local opinion and information was that the money should be lent for such purposes as cheaply as to the landlords he had made some inquiries with respect to a railway which was projected in the county of donegal with reference to which a memorial was presented to the chief secretary for ireland some short time since he had written to a respected parish priest who had been instrumental in bringing the memorial forward and who had given a great deal of time and attention to the relief of distress in his district it would not be necessary to mention his name he had written to that gentleman and asked him whether the cesspayers in his locality would consent to be taxed for the purpose of the erection of the railway in reply he had received a letter which answered the question in the negative after making inquiries he had also written another letter stating that those in his district were unanimously of opinion that section of the bill making a baronial guarantee a necessity in order to obtain a government loan would prove futile what they wanted was to have the board of guardians substituted for the baronial sessions that change was warranted by the nature and objects of the bill which was ostensibly a measure to relieve distress he thought he had said enough about those clauses to show that they opened floodgates to abuse of which none could at present see the extent without even remedying the chief misfortunes of the country and that under the plea of remedying distress in ireland the government offered a prospect to jobbery which it was impossible to calculate with any certainty and that the government did not meet as far as their calculations could be understood they did not meet the wants in question and that the railways which were projected and the making of which would relieve the present distress in ireland would not be able to obtain the loans under the proposed bill it was probable that parts of the bill as it now stood would be hurtful rather than beneficial he thought at all events that they should limit the extent of the clauses very carefully and that the companies should be named in a schedule to which it was proposed to advance loans under the bill now before the house the irish members would then be able to see what they were asked to do and would not be compelled to take extraordinary measures to find out what they were asked to agree to he then came to the small provision for fishery piers so far from the clauses in the bill which referred to the fishery piers being an advantage to the fisheries they were the reverse as most of them were to be started on parts of the coast where they were not likely to be completed the grants were also saddled with such conditions as it was not at all probable would be carried out for in one part of the clause it was proposed that in any place where it was proposed to construct a new pier or harbour the barony of that district must make a presentment to the effect and undertaking to bear one fourth of the excess of expenditure which must be incurred in carrying out such work according to that the barony must blindly bind itself to pay for the blunders of the board of works for instance if the board of works estimated that the erection of a pier or harbour would cost and it was found that the cost was the barony would have to contribute one fourth before a single stone was laid of the proposed work it would have to guarantee in all cases one fourth of the excess expenditure that was a proposition which he felt sure very few of them would feel inclined to accede to there were a number of other objections to the details of the bill which would however be best used in committee and therefore he proposed to pass them finally the canadian and liverpool fund granted towards the fishery piers and the chief secretary for ireland only proposed to grant double that amount namely if the right hon gentleman wished to carry out his avowed intention he would have to grant at least the amount mentioned was altogether illusory because ireland had received nothing for a number of years from parliament towards the erection of the fishery piers since the union scotland had received over in grants in aid of fisheries while during the last six years ireland had received nothing at all while he was informed that if the miserable pittance of which had been mentioned was granted nothing more would be given for the next five years in fact the chief secretary for ireland had set his bait with the little sprat of in order to catch the magnificent mackerel of for his own part he mr parnell felt disposed to leave the money in the hands of the treasury he did not intend to oppose the second reading of the bill but it seemed to him that it would be the duty of the irish members to try every possible way to amend it in committee at present it was practically a sham bill it did not fulfil the object it had in view namely the relief of distress in ireland it did not touch it if they voted the money asked for neither the nor the would reach the people for the next six months which was when they wanted it most he thought the chief secretary for ireland had really underestimated the magnitude of the distress he thought there would be a good harvest he was sure he mr parnell hoped there would be a good harvest but not one good harvest nor two good harvests would remove the pressure in ireland the potato crop was he was glad to say doing very well and it appeared to be one of the best that had been in ireland for many years but at the same time he must say the real suffering was due not so much to the failure of the potato crop in the past as to other causes the distressed districts were generally those in the west of ireland where there were a large number of small holdings little strips of land and the tenants of those places were more in the position of labourers than that of farmers there were about of these holdings those men had been in the habit of going to england and scotland and working for the farmers there in times of distress but owing to the state of manufacture in england the urban populations of england had been driven to the country and had taken the employment which used to be taken up by the irish tenants the consequence of that was that those men had scraped up every farthing of money to go to england in search of work and when they got there they were utterly unable to obtain it it was a great mistake to suppose that the poorer classes lived now as they did before the famine entirely on potatoes they lived far more upon indian meal which it required money to buy as it required money also to pay their rents and even if they had a good harvest the landlords might step in and seize the crops for the rent the bill of the right hon gentleman would not prevent that he did not agree with his right hon friend the member for carlow mr gray that the irish members could throw their responsibility upon the government the constituencies of ireland had made the greatest sacrifices to return them and if they threw their responsibility on the government the constituencies would be deeply and bitterly disappointed therefore it would be their duty on that and any future stage of the bill to point out its utter unsuitableness for its ostensible purpose and to show the government how they could meet the distress which was still of great intensity he proposed when the bill reached the committee to ask the house to assign the which was intended by the bill to go to the owners of land instead of that to assign it to boards of guardians in ireland thus enabling them to lend money directly to occupiers willing to improve their land he felt convinced that in no other way could they have the slightest hope of rescuing of the irish peasantry from the last stage of pauperism in no other way could they check pauperism and emigration which in time would sweep away every young man woman and child in the country he believed if the chief secretary for ireland would go down along mayo and the other parts of the western coast of ireland his heart would be almost broken down with what he would see there he must not take too much time to consider the subject and unless he did something in that bill for the purpose of freeing the people from pauperism and from the necessity for emigration both must go on and he would not have any opportunity until next session while he was considering the question the people would be gone it was impossible to stop it if the government deliberately refused to provide the people of ireland with employment they were deliberately encouraging outrage and revolution if the government of the queen showed itself insensible to the sufferings of multitudes it lost its title to a responsible government and they could not blame the ignorance of the people of the west of ireland if they should attempt to do for themselves that which the government refused to do for them for his own part he should take every opportunity of showing the government in the present crisis the urgent necessity of doing something more than they had been doing and for attempting at any rate to put a stop to the terrible scenes of suffering and privation which at present existed mr parnell i am asking what amount of loans was sanctioned up to the time the late government wont out of office mr parnell said he wished to ask the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant whether he proposed to take the committee on the bill to morrow friday there was not he thought sufficient opportunity afforded for preparing amendments to the bill and although the irish members had done all they could to arrange about amendments there had not been sufficient time to bring them forward and they had therefore made small progress in that direction of course if the right hon gentleman really wished to get into committee they could then move to report progress with the understanding that some days or perhaps a week later the matter could come up for further consideration he trusted that the postponement would take place say until next week in order that they might have the opportunity of drawing up amendments that would be satisfactory\n",

      "mr parnell said he hoped the chief secretary for ireland would abandon his intention of proceeding with that stage of the bill at present because he thought the irish members should have an opportunity of considering the situation and line of action they proposed with regard to the bill it was important they should know the intention of government in the matter both as regarded the interests of ireland and the saving of the time of the house if they were compelled to go into a premature discussion upon the committee stage of that bill at that moment they might be obliged to give the debate an extent and a tendency which they might find themselves in a position to avoid hereafter the course of the government in any case was unusual the second reading of the bill was taken last night after full and fair time had been allowed for its consideration and then the committee stage was put down for to day without affording any time to members to place amendments upon the notice paper he saw however that some members endowed with greater activity than the generality of irish members did succeed in the five minutes that had elapsed between the second reading and the rising of the house in placing some amendments upon the notice paper but a very large number of amendments which had been prepared by the irish members it was utterly impossible to place on the paper it had always been the custom of the house to take the motion for going into committee on a bill at a time when it was possible that amendments might appear on the notice paper but by the present action of the government they were entirely debarred from the advantages which the rules of the house usually afforded to members he thought it would be a course that would be convenient to the house to postpone the committee on the bill and he asked that that should be done in the interests of ireland it would be in the recollection of the house that on the second reading of the land act bill introduced by his hon friend the member for mayo mr o'connor power the government received it in a friendly spirit and there was nothing that took place at that time that could have led the house to suppose that the government intended subsequently to oppose it but after a week or so in obedience to a pressure of a section behind the government the chief secretary for ireland announced without waiting to hear the reasons that might be urged in debate that the government could not accede to the second reading of the bill and stated that it was intended to amend the present measure for the relief of the irish distress by the introduction of a supplementary clause giving power to county court judges to award compensation for eviction the notice of the introduction of the clause involved a very important change in the policy of the government as regarded the relief of the distress in ireland it was true that the distress in ireland could not be satisfactorily relieved without some amendment of the law between landlord and tenant but they found in the vacillation that had marked the government in the conduct of this matter a want of firmness a want of belief that they had any force behind them on which they could rely because in obedience to the motion of the hon member for mid lincoln mr chaplin the government could change their policy and abandon their intention of introducing the clause that had been announced he found now that the subject intended to have been introduced in the bill by the government was to be brought forward in a fresh bill of which the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland had given notice all they knew was that he had given notice of it though no further guarantee in respect of it they had no surety that in a few days the right hon gentleman would not come and announce that owing to the pressure of public business he felt unable to proceed with the bill if they allowed the present bill to go through without some assurance that the other bill would not be abandoned they might be left entirely in the lurch under all these circumstances in view of all these changes of front on the part of the government three in number during the last three or four days he thought the irish members should be afforded an opportunity of meeting together and considering what policy they would adopt on the committee stage of the irish belief bill whether they would permit it to go through on the vague assurance they had received from the government of the introduction of another measure of the terms of which they knew nothing or whether they would adopt some special course he had seen enough already to be able to indicate that it would be a saving of the time of the house to afford the irish members the opportunity they asked for even without the very exceptional circumstances he had mentioned they were entitled by the ordinary practice of the house to more than hours notice of the committee stage of that important measure the constituencies represented felt very deeply upon the matter and would not be satisfied unless the course he proposed were adopted he could understand the difficulties under which the government laboured in dealing with any irish question he could understand that they had a majority that was not well acquainted with the condition of affairs in ireland not so well acquainted as even the chief secretary for ireland himself and that those difficulties only made it more difficult for the chief secretary to carry out his views as to what was right and proper for the government of ireland at the same time the irish members had their difficulties and they felt that they must stand firm in respect to this question that they should lose no opportunity of pressing their views upon the house for endeavouring to revise the practice that formerly existed with respect to irish affairs and of trying to strengthen the chief secretary for ireland in his good intentions with regard to the good government of the country he had adopted he trusted therefore the right hon gentleman would consent to postpone the present stage of that important measure until they had a further opportunity of considering what course they should adopt there was no particular hurry about the matter because the money parliament was asked to grant was not going to buy bread for a single person wanting it in ireland and as regarded the fishery piers any period of the season would do as well for the passing of the measure therefore he would ask the chief secretary to postpone the committee stage of the bill until they had an opportunity of seeing the other relief of distress in ireland bill which it was proposed to introduce and of ascertaining whether the government really intended to press it forward he moved therefore the adjournment of the debate mr parnell said that after the very satisfactory and kind statement of the prime minister he would ask leave to withdraw his motion for the adjournment of the debate mr parnell thought that the circulars gave power for additional loans to be obtained mr parnell said the right hon gentleman appeared to complain of a breach of understanding which he had described as having been entered into at the commencement of the day proceedings he correctly stated that upon his undertaking that the clause of the bill should not be proceeded with in committee he mr parnell expressed his perfect satisfaction the right hon gentleman had also said he mr parnell expressed his willingness to withdraw his motion for the adjournment of the debate but the right hon gentleman treated him rather unfairly when he intimated to the house that the debate which ensued on the motion for going into committee was brought on by him mr parnell or that it had been controlled by him when he spoke the right hon gentleman assumed that he was representing the views of those hon members who sat behind him it should be borne in mind that the debate which ultimately ensued on the bill was continued by hon members on the ministerial side of the house with whom he had personally no influence whatever it was not until the chief secretary made a statement that he considered it necessary that some action should be taken what was the statement of the chief secretary the right hon gentleman pointed out that the result of carrying out the arrangement made between the prime minister and himself mr parnell would be to put off the further stages of the bill until a very late period of the session and that the people of ireland would be deprived of the benefit of the bill and amongst other things they would be deprived of the grant for fishery piers and that consequently the fishing industry on the north west and west coasts of ireland would be materially injured and the starving population suffer during the ensuing season what was this statement of the chief secretary but quibbling he must therefore throw the blame of the subsequent discussion on the chief secretary why should they tacitly accept the blame which was due to the right hon gentleman it was to point out some practical way to making progress that his hon friend the member for galway mr t p o'connor rose and moved that the bill be referred to a select committee consisting of the irish members which would naturally save the time of the house and enable them to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion that discussion had arisen because the chief secretary had cavilled at the arrangement which had been made entered into two hours ago it was not likely that the irish members would sit under the imputation which the chief secretary had thrown on them they therefore threw back on him the odium of breaking the arrangement and impeding the progress of the measure\n",

      "mr parnell in moving that the bill be now read a second time said he hoped the house would allow him to take that stage of it on the present occasion he should not have moved the second reading at so late an hour but for the pressing emergency of the case and because if he now neglected the opportunity of not obtaining the opinion of the house concerning the measure such an opportunity would not again arise owing to the difficulty which private members found in obtaining consideration for their bills the provisions of his bill were of a very simple character in the first place he proposed to appoint a commission which should be charged with the relief of distress in ireland the commission to consist of the chairman and two honorary secretaries of the principal organization which had been engaged in distributing the sums subscribed in relief of distress in ireland during the past half year the commission would have the usual power of appointing a chairman and he proposed that there should be set aside for the purposes of relief of distress in ireland of the surplus funds of the irish church which should be used as the commissioners might think fit in relief of distress in ireland it was of course dangerous to use the saying of president lincoln to swap horses when crossing a stream but this seemed to be the process which was being pursued by the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of ireland in reference to this question of relieving distress in ireland for six months the relief committees had afforded assistance to the distressed districts with but little assistance from the poor law boards or the relief works the subscriptions which these bodies had collected and distributed had now however almost come to an end and they were face to face with the position that during the next month or six weeks some people who had been fed through the agency of the committees to which he had referred would have no one to look to for their daily bread the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant said he relied upon out door relief as a means of meeting the difficulty but this system of relief was dependent upon the boards of guardians which in ireland had never been employed for this purpose he was of opinion that he spoke the sentiments of those best able to judge when he said that he viewed with the utmost apprehension the result of trying such an experiment as was suggested by the right hon gentleman who had informed the house that in consequence of certain boards of guardians having failed to do their work he had decided upon dissolving them and appointing officials to do their work this was all very well but he doubted whether such officials would be able to cope with the existing distress the chief secretary had of course the utmost desire to do all that was possible but it was to be feared that the right hon gentleman did not know to the full the nature of the difficulties which were before him and the magnitude of the crisis which was impending it would be difficult to retrace any steps that might be taken after the mischief had happened and the people had died in large numbers of the famine fever which had broken out in many districts of the country in these circumstances he hoped that the house would accept the proposal which was embodied in his bill and would enable the relief committees which had up to the present time done so much good to continue their work with the assistance of a grant of public money until the present crisis had been passed and happily with the blessing of a good harvest the existing distress had been tided over the system of out door relief in ireland was not managed in the same way as it was in england it was in ireland looked on by every poor law guardian with the utmost repugnance and aversion as a plan opposed to all their most cherished convictions and one which in the present instance would necessitate the borrowing of money that would have to be repaid by ratepayers farmers and others who were reduced to great straits by the same circumstances which caused the poorer classes to be very poor indeed he was afraid that the chief secretary would recognize the dislike to the system of out door relief too late either to save his reputation as a minister or to save the lives of many of the irish people he believed that his proposal would prevent much suffering and save many lives within the next six or seven weeks and he therefore asked the house to read it a second time promising that when the committee stage was reached he would carefully consider any proposal that might be made for its amendment the hon gentleman concluded by moving the second reading of the bill mr parnell said he had no desire to do anything other than to relieve irish distress and if it was objected that the land league should not be intrusted with part of the work of distribution he should be perfectly willing to omit it from the bill mr parnell agreed to the adjournment of the debate and said he would put the bill on the paper for the following monday on the understanding that no unfair advantage should be taken of the adjournment to block the further progress of the measure\n",

      "mr parnell sir i trust the hon member for the county tyrone mr litton who has charge of the bill will excuse me if i venture to speak after he has addressed the house but i wish to say a few words in explanation of my reasons for not being able to vote in favour of a bill which he has brought forward i agree that the government is entitled to some sympathy in the attitude which they have taken up the bill pretends to be a final settlement of the irish land question and it seems to have been brought forward as such by the hon member who is in charge of it without a sufficient idea of the exigencies of the moment it differs in that respect from the bill for compensation for disturbance of the government which as i take it does not profess to be even a temporary settlement of the land question but only an alleviation of the tension and pressure in that system is there any hon gentleman in this house who will say that a government which has just come into office is not entitled to time for consideration of a tangled and difficult question such as the irish land question before it endorses a principle about which there is great difference of opinion in ireland and which has not been unanimously accepted in that country as a final settlement of the land question i have listened with great interest to the remarks of my hon friend the member for meath mr metge who stated his belief that this measure would only touch the case of large tenants in ireland for myself i think that if the machinery proposed by the bill was workable and could be properly put into operation it would be of advantage to the tenants in the north as well as in the south and would include those who occupy farms of a large size as well as those of more moderate dimensions i deny however entirely that it would be of the slightest use to the small tenants who have really made the irish land what it is and whose sufferings have placed the irish land question in its position before the british public i do not wish to throw any obstacle in the way of the final settlement of the land question but i have in times past voted on more than one occasion for the bill of mr butt a bill similar to the one before the house but i consider that mr butt bill was a considerable improvement on this one in many working points and one of them was that it threw the onus on the landlord to bring the tenant into court i think however that one of the real difficulties next to insecurity of tenure in respect of the irish land question is that the land is badly distributed what happened after the irish famine during that famine the landlords took the opportunity of making extensive clearances especially in the county meath and other districts in which there were large tracts of land devoted to grazing the residue of the people went to the hillsides and bogs of connaught where their descendants are now living on land consisting of bog and mountain which they have redeemed there are in ireland small tenants who can hardly pay any rent at all and it would be purely mockery to go to these men with this bill in order to remedy the state of things in the west of ireland we require either emigration or migration there are in ireland acres light grazing land occupied by graziers in farms of or acres these lands which were formerly in cultivation are not suitable to be permanently laid down in pasture they require to be broken up and cropped and what i propose is that the tenants on the poor lands in the west of ireland should be given an opportunity of migrating to those grazing lands i believe the better settlement of the land question lies in giving the tenants of ireland an opportunity of becoming the owners of the land i wish to enable this to be done by the issue of debentures at 3½ per cent guaranteed by the state i believe that after this year many landlords will be willing and anxious to sell their lands on easy terms the present bill will be of no use to more than a minority of irish tenants who have an interest in the soil and are undoubtedly deserving but who have not made the land question in ireland what it now is i think that the government are entitled to have an opportunity of considering the question as a whole and of seeing whether they could not enlarge the land act of so as to enable it to meet the objects of the promoters of this bill and also to provide some means by which tenants could purchase their holdings on fair and reasonable terms i believe that the existing irish land system cannot possibly continue and if the house passes this bill it will only be prolonging a system which has worked and is still working incalculable evil to ireland in england tenants are comparatively pros perous and contented because owing to the remembrance of the feudal system the landlords while insisting on their rights do not altogether forget their duties in ireland where the feudal system does not survive the landlords claim their rights but forget their duties the irish system has failed in every european country where it has been tried and i must add that it has been attended in ireland with more evil than in any other country in which it has been in operation i believe that the agitation now going on in ireland will make the farmers see that the only way of settling the land question is by their acquiring the ownership of their holdings i must again express my opinion that the government is now entitled to an opportunity of considering the whole subject and that under the circumstances it would be better not to press the second reading of this bill and if next session they do not bring forward satisfactory proposals we shall know how to proceed\n",

      "mr parnell said it was with the utmost reluctance that as an irish protestant a member of the synod of the protestant church of ireland and the parochial nominator of his parish chosen by the votes of his fellow protestants to that office he wished to explain his reasons for the vote which he intended to give for the resolution of the prime minister he could not recollect any time when he had felt greater timidity less confidence in the result of the action which he was about to take or less confident in the belief that the mass of the irish people were behind him than upon the present occasion in his past political life he had always felt that his action would be understood and appreciated by his constituents but upon the present occasion he was bound to believe there was at all events very great risk of its being misunderstood his religion however taught him to be just and fear not and although a man might be placed under a temporary cloud or a temporary disqualification he thought and felt convinced that in the long run if he acted according to the just dictates of his own conscience every right thinking man at home in ireland would ultimately come to his support now why did he intend to vote for the resolution of the prime minister because he believed that the law entitled mr bradlaugh to take his seat in that house and he objected to that method of making law by parliamentary resolution if those gentlemen on the opposition side of the house desired to keep mr bradlaugh out of the house and who said they desired to do so because the law was against his views if they desired what they said why did they not legally test the question but what had they done they had prevented any legal test from being taken they had deliberately prevented the action of the ordinary law of the land and they had deliberately prevented an important constituency like northampton from having its right of representation in the house of commons now a cry had been raised against him mr parnell in ireland that he was an atheist because he voted for the admission of mr bradlaugh he wished to say that mr bradlaugh religious tenets and his doctrines with reference to over population were abominable but because he mr parnell objected to 1305that gentleman doctrines on those questions was not a sufficient reason why he should go contrary to the law catholic members for ireland had felt very strongly on the question very strongly indeed and they had been told that they ought to recollect that it was once sought to keep them out just as it was now sought to keep mr bradlaugh out but he would ask the catholic members what did they fear did they fear that their religion would be injured by mr bradlaugh introduction to the house no no if they did not then upon what principle did they proceed he had listened carefully to many of the speeches of his catholic friends from ireland and it had appeared to him that they had argued that it was their duty as catholics to keep mr bradlaugh out of the house lest their religion should be injured by his introduction no no then for what other reason did they object to his coming there an appeal had been made to catholic ireland they had been told that that little island was the last country that had resisted the inroads of continental infidelity and that unless they desired that that odious thing should creep into ireland they must keep mr bradlaugh out of the house well that surely seemed to indicate a fear on the part of irish catholics that their religion might be injured by mr bradlaugh introduction into the house but were they entitled really to look at it from that point of view were they as catholics entitled to say because we are catholics we object to mr bradlaugh for they must recollect exactly the same argument was used against their own admission why were catholics deprived of their civil rights for centuries why were they prevented from coming into that house it was because protestants feared that the admission of catholics would injure the protestant religion and it was because the majority of protestants began to see that even if they had that fear it was an unworthy fear and a fear that they ought not to allow to influence them in considering the civil rights of their fellowmen that catholics were at last admitted to the same civil and religious rights as protestants they must never forget that in dealing with this subject if they once admitted the principle that they were entitled to ob 1306ject to a man because his doctrines were likely to injure their religion they struck at the very root of civil and religious liberty and that was why he felt it his duty to do that which was personally odious to him it was a personally odious task for him to undertake to vote for the admission of the hon member for northampton mr bradlaugh to that house but if he had to walk through that lobby by himself he should feel himself a coward if he refused to do so\n",

      "mr parnell said that in the absence of the right hon gentleman the member for the county carlow mr gray he had to ask for permission to move the amendment of which the right hon gentleman had given notice the amendment related to the advances made by parliament for the purpose of enabling boards of guardians in certain districts of ireland to lend or advance seed in the shape of the potato seed and for other crops to such persons as should require them by the act under which these advances were authorized it was provided that the loans should be repaid by the boards of guardians to the treasury at the end of next year but in order to effect that re payment it had been necessary for the boards of guardians to collect the first instalment of the advance from the tenants this was done in many cases before the growth of the crop to produce which the seed had been lent had been got in it was very commonly the case with regard to potatoes to allow them to remain in the ground until a late period because it was found that they ate the better for being left in the ground also that they were less liable to disease afterwards there was some talk in ireland during the late election of asking the government to remit the whole of the amount advanced for seed but the leaders of public opinion upon re considering the matter had thought that if they could obtain for the tenants the postponement of the re payment of the first instalment for another year they would be thus in a position to pay the amount to the treasury the loans had been described as having been of enormous assistance to all classes in ireland and it had been felt by the tenants that they ought to endeavour to do their very best to repay the loans as soon as it was possible to be done the seed purchased for the purpose of making these loans was purchased at a very high rate indeed he might state that the rates were per cent over the market price previously asked the rise in the price of the seed was in consequence of the passage of that act the great demand for fresh seed caused an increase in the price consequently boards of guardians had to buy seed at a price at which potatoes never reached before in ireland so from every point of view the charge was an exceedingly heavy one upon tenant farmers and it would be impossible for them to meet it at the present time the guardians admitted that if the advance were collected at the present time the result would be that the feelings of the people would be set against the re payment of the loan altogether the people desired to pay it but if pressed by the guardians for re payment before their crops were brought in public opinion in ireland would be more or less set against the re payment altogether at present the desire was to look upon this as a just debt and to avoid any unnecessary hardship in the collection of the money they therefore thought that the amendment of the right hon gentleman the lord mayor of dublin was a fair and proper one they asked the assent of the government to the proposal that the landlords should not be asked to repay their loans for two years but they now asked that the same period should be extended to the tenants the tenants were willing to pay half of the advance if postponed for a year and the remaining half at the end of the year he begged to move mr parnell said that they did not propose to take money out of the public funds the money had been already taken out of the public funds and the amendment dealt only with the question of the postponement of re payment with all submission to the chair he thought it was quite competent to move the amendment he would also point out that the bill already dealt with grants from the public funds by clause the commissioners of public works were authorized to make advances of certain amounts of public money mr parnell said he did not consider the proposition of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland was quite so satisfactory as some of his hon friends seemed to think but in the absence of his right hon friend the lord mayor of dublin mr gray who had placed this amendment on the paper and who took a great interest in the question he could not take upon himself the responsibility of rejecting the compromise more especially as he was assured that they could not continue the discussion upon this question by reason of the rules of the house but he would suggest to the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland that he should take the power in his proposed new clause for the local government board to postpone the repayment of a portion or the whole of the instalments in any union that the local government board might think proper because it was exceedingly probable that there would be a great many unions where it was difficult for a portion of the tenant farmers to pay this year and yet the remaining portion of the farmers might be able to pay at the same time he thought it would probably have been better if he could allow the whole of the charge to be postponed for a year the committee would recollect that that was the intention of the legislature on the passing of the act of parliament the intention of the legislature was evidently that the farmer should pay in the next months that was shown by the way the act of parliament referred to the boards of guardians but by a rule necessarily adopted by the local government board in order that the boards of guardians should pay next year it became necessary that the tenants should pay this year so that the intention of the legislature was clear that the tenants should not be called upon to pay this year he thought that where the payment could not be made without undue harshness or pressure upon those who had contracted the debt then the re payment was a matter which could not fairly be insisted upon of course they had been charged with the desire to repudiate their debts but he believed that no people were more willing than the people of ireland to carry out their just contracts contracts entered into according to the conditions under which contracts were usually entered into in civilized countries he had seen no disposition on the part of the poor law unions in ireland to repudiate their just debts he should ask permission to withdraw the amendment mr parnell said the amendment which he was about to move namely to insert in page after the word act inline and whereas it is desirable to enable the commissioners of public works on the recommendation of the local government board to advance moneys by way of grant to the boards of guardians in scheduled unions subject to the restrictions and conditions hereinafter set forth must be taken in connection with the next amendment standing in his name namely the addition to this clause of the following words the commissioners of the public works in ireland may from time to time on the recommendation of the local government board grant to any board of guardians of a scheduled union out of the said sum of one million five hundred thousand pounds such moneys as the local government board may deem necessary having regard to the financial condition of such union to aid in giving out door relief to such union provided that the entire sum to be so granted shall not exceed one hundred thousand pounds that amendment had been framed in view of the suggestion made by the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland the other morning when they were discussing the second reading of the relief of distress bill no the right hon gentleman then suggested that the adjournment of that bill should be agreed to with the view of introducing an amendment to carry out the effect of the modifications which he mr parnell had agreed to make in his bill the bill as it originally stood provided that the grant of should be given to a commission which was indicated in the bill but in the discussion upon the second reading the chief secretary for ireland seemed so very much averse to taking the matter out of the hands of the poor law board that it was suggested that the local government board should be intrusted with the distribution of the proposed grant now he mr parnell thought if power was given to the local government board to grant money to certain unions it would facilitate enormously the setting in motion of the machinery of the poor law in reference to outdoor relief speed being of the utmost importance at that moment he thought that if the right hon gentleman attempted to drive the poor law boards in ireland into the distribution of outdoor relief it was most desirable that he should have willing instead of unwilling horses to drive it stood to reason that if the unions knew they had in the clause the means of obtaining grants in aid of out door relief they would be much more willing than they were at present to set their machinery in motion there was an example in point in the poor law act which provided that medical stores and attendance should be paid by grant and their experience of the working of the act showed that the amount of medical comforts and attendance had been increased by the fact that only half of the cost was charged on the rates while the rest was paid by the means of grants now at that moment the people of ireland were getting weaker and weaker and were becoming more liable to the fever spotted typhus fever which had broken out in galway the right hon gentleman seemed rather to take comfort to himself that this fever had not originated since he had commenced his system of out door relief but at all events it had originated since the right hon gentleman assumed the reins of government in ireland he mr parnell had no wish to throw the responsibility for this upon him because no doubt it had come as one of the heritages created by the ineffectual attempts of the late government to deal with the distress the people of ireland had been living on meal supplied by charitable contributions those contributions had fallen off and in a few weeks the strain of relieving the people would be thrown upon the system which the chief secretary for ireland was putting into operation but the few poor law boards administering relief had been doing so in an inefficient manner and with the most careful regard to the pockets of the ratepayers and already the chief secretary for ireland had had to nominate paid commissioners in their stead the committee possessed little information as to these official guardians and it might he believed be assumed that it was not easy to get men capable of dealing at short notice with the emergency which existed in ireland any inducement therefore which the legislature could give the poor law unions to co operate in the system of relief would be of the utmost importance he would therefore suggest that in the event of his amendment being agreed to the local government board should announce to such unions as they thought proper where any emergency existed that they would give one half one third or one fourth of the amount paid for out door relief the unions would then have a direct stimulus to administer relief because if they refused they could be forced to do so and if they threw obstructions in the way of the local government board they could be punished by withholding from them the proposed grants in aid he had a right to say that the unanimous opinion of the irish members was entitled to consideration and when he moved the second reading of his bill hon member after hon member had risen and urged its acceptance by the government the irish members had in every way met the wishes of the government and they had agreed to leave the distribution of the money in the hands of the poor law boards although they were convinced that there existed an emergency with which it was impossible to cope even by means of those boards he therefore urged upon the right hon gentleman the necessity of accepting his amendment the money was to come out of the irish church fund and would therefore lay no burden on the imperial exchequer it was the money of the irish people already had been given out of the irish church fund to the commissioners of works and he believed that this grant which he now proposed would be instrumental during the six weeks which intervened between that time and the harvest in preventing much sickness and in saving a good many lives the special commissioner of the freeman journal reported that fever was raging in swinford union a total of people had been removed to the workhouse suffering with fever some doubt had been cast upon the opinion that it was famine fever but if it was not famine fever it was fever caused by distress and by want of food as well as by the want of change of diet again if it was not famine fever it was because there had not been the same extremity of distress and actual famine in ireland as there had been in but it was more virulent and more catching and was likely to spread over a large area if some machinery could not be had to provide better food and clothing for the people than they had during the last six months he had information that the allowance of indian meal to each person per day was about ounces and this it would be seen was not so good as the allowance in the prisons in this country where they gave soup and potatoes twice a day under these circumstances he urged upon the government the necessity of making further provision for the relief of the people of ireland but unless some relief were given to the bankrupt poor law boards it would be impossible to make any change in the scale of diet which they were obliged to adopt with the object therefore of preventing further sickness and loss of life in ireland he begged to move the insertion of the amendment of which he had given notice such amendment to be taken as he proposed in connection with the next amendment standing in his name amendment proposed in page line after act to insert and whereas it is desirable to enable the commissioner of public works on the recommendation of the local government board to advance moneys by way of grant to boards of guardians in scheduled unions subject to the restrictions and conditions here in after set forth mr parnell question proposed that those words be there inserted mr parnell said that he thought his hon friend mr synan was under a wrong impression he would see that the amendment in the name of the hon member for roscommon dr commins was not of an alternative character for that which stood in his name the amendment of the hon member for roscommon was one throwing an additional sum of upon the consolidated fund whereas that in the name of the hon member mr synan was one reducing the rate of interest to per cent mr parnell said that the right hon gentleman the member for the county of carlow mr gray not having risen to move his amendment and no amendment having been before the committee subsequently he submitted that his hon friend mr synan was entitled to move that which stood in his name mr parnell said that the statement that had been made previously that the distress in ireland had not been relieved from the imperial exchequer was strictly accurate notwithstanding the exception mentioned by the hon member but it should be remembered that the seed potatoes act although it would be of great use in the coming winter had not yet been of any assistance in relieving actual distress it was true therefore that the distress in ireland up to the present had not been relieved to any extent by the government whatever he demurred altogether to the statement of the noble lord the secretary to the treasury lord frederick cavendish that the last parliament had sanctioned this expenditure the last parliament did not sanction this expenditure what it did sanction was an expenditure of he contended that they were perfectly justified in asking the present parliament to re consider the matter they were not asking this parliament to re consider the question of this expenditure but they said that if they were bound to ratify the act of the previous government this ratification ought to be given at the expense of the imperial exchequer but they ought not to put their hands into the unfortunate and not very full pockets of the irish what were the facts of this case so far from the last parliament having sanctioned the expenditure of the government it was exactly the reverse by an act of last session was granted for the purpose of making loans to landlords and sundry county authorities this bill was passed to ratify the proceedings and orders of the british government who found that so far from the irish government having undertaken to advance when the treasury minute under which the notice in the dublin gazette was published only sanctioned the advance of the treasury minute after describing the purposes for which the government were willing to advance the money went on to say that the government had decided to recommend the commissioners of public works in ireland upon the responsibility of the government to make an advance not exceeding the total sum of he thought it should be distinctly understood that in accordance with these directions by the treasury a notice was issued by the commissioners of public works in the dublin gazette of the 3rd january distinctly stating that loans not exceeding would be granted on certain conditions the landlords borrowing money were therefore distinctly informed that the loan would not amount to more than the government however came forward in the last session and granted an additional sum of to the landlords making a total amount of money authorized of there was not the slightest necessity for the further advance as was shown by the return moved by the right hon gentleman the member for north devon sir stafford northcote that return showed that up to the 10th of april only had been sanctioned and ordered to be advanced to the landlords on the 7th of may when the present government came into office it was absolutely impossible that the further sum now asked for could in the meantime have been sanctioned conditionally he confessed he could not understand upon what ground they were now told in the course of this discussion that the government was morally bound to increase the amount originally the notice issued by the government to the landlords distinctly stated that the amount of loan would be limited to and that amount was subsequently increased to but up to the 10th of april the amount of loan sanctioned was only he could see no excuse for the present government asking that these loans might be sanctioned the amount sanctioned by the act of the last session was only and he could see no reason that they were morally or legally bound or in any sense bound to increase that amount he wished now to make an explanation upon another point the government had given them the difference of this money and had taken power by accepting the amendment which he introduced later on to apply a certain sum for the purpose of out door relief he thought it was only fair to them to pay interest and principal for such useful purposes out of the church surplus fund so far as the money at present advanced was concerned not more than had reached the hands of the distressed people and he could not therefore regard the act as one for the purpose of relieving irish distress but by the acceptance of his amendment the government had changed the situation and he should be willing to accept such sums as the government might advance to the poor law board from the operation of the amendment proposed by his hon friend mr synan he was sure that his hon friend would be willing to agree to that amendment he wished to point out to the noble lord the secretary to the treasury that the government were dealing in a most shabby way with ireland with respect to this distress up to the present time the government had not given a single penny from the imperial exchequer for the relief of distress in ireland the government of the dominion of canada had given and the late chief secretary for ireland mr j lowther was not ashamed to accept that amount and apply it to the relief of distress although he refused to recommend his own government to apply a single penny for the same purpose the legislature of canada one of the states of the american union and charitable persons throughout the entire world had subscribed sums for the relief of irish distress amounting to while the rich government of england had refused to put its hands into its pockets for one single sixpence for the same purpose he could not but think that the continual perseverance of the government in that niggardly policy was a discredit to the government of the country and he trusted that his hon friend would press his amendment to a division mr parnell said he had never hinted that the government had no power to mate these loans but he contended that there was no boon in making them he quite agreed with what had fallen from the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin mr gibson it was quite true that under the 9th section of the late act the commissioners had the power to make advances to the extent of instead of the sum promised in the circulars of the treasury but his contention was that it was not a boon to issue grants to landowners other than those granted or sanctioned by the board of works up to the 19th april according to the return moved for by the late chancellor of the exchequer the member for north devon sir stafford northcote the amount of loans sanctioned to landowners in ireland was he mr parnell contended that it was that sanction that was referred to in the portion of the 9th section quoted by the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin when he intimated that all contracts express or implied which had been fully entered into between the commissioners and any person or the sanitary authority respecting any such loans should be valid and effectual he would admit that if the board of works had entered into contracts up to the time when the late government left office to the extent of the landowners would be undoubtedly legally entitled thereto but according to the return of the board of works they had only entered into such contracts to the extent of therefore the present government could not shield itself if any excess beyond that sum was entered into he wanted to know what the present government did under these circumstances there had been no return on the subject and no information although inquiry had been made and the matter had been frequently alluded to in the discussion on that bill there had he repeated been no information whatever as to the amount of loans sanctioned by the present government to landowners when they came into office they had information in their possession to the effect that had been sanctioned but that was not he should like to know how much had been sanctioned by the present government and the reasons why they sanctioned any additional sum to that they were entitled to do the government had often expressed their disapproval of those large grants and they had thrown the blame of making such grants of public money for purposes entirely useless he must say on their predecessors but the late government he contended was only responsible for the sum of sanctioned up to the date when they left office they must necessarily exonerate them from any further responsibility and such responsibility must undoubtedly fall on the present government mr parnell said what he had meant was that the present government disapproved of the low rate of interest on the loans to landowners and had expressed a belief that they were useless for the purpose of relieving the present distress mr parnell said he did not think the time spent in discussing this question had been thrown away because to irish members it was a very important matter whether should be taken out of the irish church fund or not the fund in question was the only one they had in ireland for any purposes but this sum of would be an annual loss to the fund for purposes which the irish members entirely disapproved from the first it meant also a loss to the fund for purposes carried against their will by a majority of english and scotch members surely under these circumstances when english and scotch members insisted upon applying money to purposes disapproved by the irish members they should pay for it out of their own pockets and not insist upon the irish people paying for it if irish members could have had their way they would not have devoted one penny of the irish church fund in the way proposed by the chief secretary for ireland they had introduced certain amendments indicating the way in which they desired the money to be spent and so far as the right hon gentleman was willing to apply the money in the direction they wished they were perfectly willing that the interest should be thrown upon the irish church fund but they objected that money applied against their will and in accordance with the will of english and scotch members should be paid for out of that fund mr parnell said he could not entirely agree with the advice of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland that the committee should hurry through his bill for the reasons stated by him they had seen how much mischief had been done in the last parliament by the hurried legislation which had taken place with reference to the relief of irish distress the various points now raised had been dictated by the experience gained since that time it was rather unsatisfactory to be told by the chief secretary for ireland that unless the bill were passed through committee that evening he did not know when he could again bring it forward and that in consequence a number of benefits would be lost to ireland but there was nothing to prevent the right hon gentleman agreeing to the loans to boards of guardians and so far as the fishery piers and harbours were concerned the amount of was a very insignificant sum and one which ought to have been considered outside this bill he had himself urged upon the chief secretary for ireland the desirability of such non contentious matters being dealt with in a separate measure the right hon gentleman however had not thought proper to agree to that suggestion for his own part he was unwilling to surrender his right of discussion for the purpose of getting the he would further point out that the amendment had been down on the paper for a fortnight and it was somewhat unsatisfactory that one of the law officers of the crown the right hon and learned attorney general for ireland who he mr parnell thought was not over burdened with work had not considered it and given the committee the result of his consideration the right hon and learned gentleman had told the committee of the act of and that under it bonds had been entered into but did he know to what extent the proposed to be lent by this bill had been dealt with in those bonds again did he know the terms adopted by the board of works under the powers of the act of if they limited the works to one two or three years of course information upon these subjects was exceedingly valuable and was very much desired by the committee for their guidance seeing that the amendment had been on the paper for a fortnight it must have been evident to the right hon and learned gentleman that a discussion would be raised as to the terms of the bonds which had been entered into he could not help thinking that the right hon and learned gentleman ought to know what terms had been agreed upon if the committee were supplied with that information he could not see why they should not proceed to deal with the subject at once however in the absence of that information he did not think it desirable to postpone the question until report because as it was difficult to obtain from government reasons why they were honourably bound with reference to this sum of they might on report be unable to furnish reasons why they were honourably bound not to accept the terms of the amendment he thought the committee was entitled to some further information and would suggest either that the amendment should be accepted at once power of alteration being reserved to the government or that the clause should be withdrawn and as it was obvious that the stage of the new clause could not be reached that night it might be brought in as a new clause a few days later or whenever the government wished to take the bill again in committee he preferred that course to postponement until report which simply meant a foregone conclusion mr parnell said he should like to ask the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland mr law whether he could then give them the information for which he asked a short time since first as to the number of bonds entered into between the landlords and the board of works under the previous act of secondly the amount of money covered by those bonds thirdly the term of years covered by each class of bonds for he had understood that there were different terms for the different classes of bonds if the right hon and learned gentleman could give him an answer at the next sitting it would do quite as well mr parnell said there was a return published under date the 18th march in which it was stated that the amount sanctioned up to the 19th april was that was just before the present government came into office and he did not see why the government should have gone on sanctioning fresh loans believing as they did that this application of money was not all that it might have been now it appeared to him that the act of last session distinctly referred to the notice of the 12th january issued by the commissioners of public works the obvious inference from which was that the government were not bound to sanction loans to a greater extent than until the act of last session was passed it was admitted that the previous government had not sanctioned loans to a greater extent than 000or what the present government wanted was a sanction for their conduct with reference to this matter in continuing to sanction expenditure they said they were morally bound to expend this sum of it seemed that there was no control whatever over the proceedings of the irish government and that when anything was done all that was necessary was for the chief secretary for ireland to say that he felt himself bound in some way or other and that was all the satisfaction that could be had with reference to the applications for this money if his hon friend mr biggar went to a division he should vote for his amendment it was a monstrous thing to place a charge upon the irish church fund which was not applied to the relief of distress in ireland mr parnell said he wished to take in the best part the advice of his hon friend opposite mr fay but he must reply to him in equally good part that he intended to occupy as much time in moving the amendments in his name as he should think necessary his hon friend appeared not to make sufficient allowance for the circumstances of hon members from ireland who had from the commencement of the session taken much trouble with the bill and had imported into it valuable amendments he could not imagine how any sensible person could stand up for the proposition of the government contained in this clause but to show the absurdity the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland mr law had pointed out that the government were morally bound to lend money to those landlords who had applied up to the 29th february last now he would ask the noble lord the secretary to the treasury lord frederick cavendish who had endorsed that proposition and the chief secretary for ireland also whether if had been applied for an amount which the church surplus fund could not guarantee they would have come forward under this moral obligation which they so much commended and carried a bill through parliament to grant that sum of money he ventured to think that had they attempted to introduce a measure dealing with english money as they were now dealing with irish funds their tenure of office would have been very brief the government were certainly not legally bound to continue in the disastrous and useless course of their predecessors mr parnell said he should like to ask the committee to be allowed to amend the proposed amendment by adding a few words thereto he proposed to insert the words under the authority of the belief of distress ireland act at the end of the amendment mr parnell said he was one of those who thought those two clauses were so utterly worthless that they could not possibly be made any better and he doubted very much whether they could be so amended as to carry out his hon and gallant friend major nolan's views if the ratepayers through their representatives wished to charge themselves for the construction of county works he mr parnell had no objection but the proposition contained in those clauses was entirely different it was that anon representative body called the associated cesspayers who were chosen by the grand jury and who would be confined to the magistracy of the county should be entitled to saddle vast sums of money upon the ratepayers at an extraordinary presentment sessions convened by the lord lieutenant all the checks provided by the legislature and by the orders of the house of commons were dispensed with and consequently there would be practically no guarantee to the ratepayers who might be affected if they had a representative system of county government in ireland these clauses might be made workable and very valuable but in the absence of any representative system he feared to trust the very large power that would be given he observed that a great number of amendments had been placed upon the paper to open the floodgates still higher and in his humble opinion they would make the clauses still more dangerous than they were already but he thought the committee were entitled to have some reason for the postponement of the clauses they ought to know whether the right hon gentleman proposed to postpone them in order to consider the desirability of giving them up altogether or whether he intended to stand by them if the first reason was the true motive and the effect of the proposal would only be to save the time of the committee he should certainly be in favour of going on with the other part of the bill but with reference to the remarks of the hon member for meath mr metge who seemed to be in a state of intense excitement about the whole measure and feared they might lose something very wonderful if they did not get it he could only say that so far as they had gone they had not obtained any very important concessions perhaps they might obtain those concessions by and bye but in explanation of the misapprehension of the hon member for meath with respect to the merits of this measure he mr parnell might be permitted to state that he had no recollection of the fact that the hon member had assisted in the numerous consultations which had been held for the purpose of practically improving the bill notwithstanding that the hon member represented that great evils would attend the stopping of so beneficial a measure he mr parnell for one would very much like to ask the hon member for a fuller explanation of what his views really were mr parnell said he certainly did not say the concession was worthless at any rate he had no intention of going further than saying that it was not satisfactory mr parnell said he must confess he would like to find some way of carrying the motion without going to a division the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland seemed to think that no one but himself was dinnerless but he mr parnell could assure the right hon gentleman that many of them had had nothing to eat since breakfast he would not press that argument because he thought all the irish members were very ready to vote fasting in fact irishmen were generally understood to be able to fight without anything to eat whilst englishmen and scotchmen always required to be well fed but as regarded those two clauses he really thought it would be a great waste of time going into them that night as the right hon gentleman had said the fishery piers and his own proposal of grants to boards of guardians were in his opinion the only important parts of the bill mr parnell said he was quite aware that the right hon gentleman did not he only gave it as his own opinion although he did not think it was a very wonderful concession to have the option of giving to the people of ireland of their own money when they were going to give l of their own money to the landlords still of course it was a concession and he was happy to admit it however since the 3rd and 4th clauses which he was really not clear that they ought to have come into any relief of distress bill and which would take an enormous deal of time to lick into shape if indeed they could be licked into shape which he very much doubted since those clauses were to be postponed he was personally perfectly willing to go on with the bill for any reasonable time and perhaps under those circumstances the hon member for waterford mr e power would reconsider his motion mr parnell said it appeared from the remarks of the noble lord lord frederick cavendish that the treasury would be threatened with bankruptcy in case that grant were increased to that only showed to what desperate devices hon gentlemen might be driven in order to avoid any increase of expenditure he did think that such a sum as was a poor miserable sum considering what was required to be spent on the west coast of ireland the inspectors of fisheries had recommended that some harbours should be built they asked for that purpose for a vote of and was to be given by canada and liverpool making a total of and that was all that could be obtained in order that the fishermen might reap the magnificent harvest that providence sent them as a measure for the relief of distress it was equally miserable he was sorry that the noble lord the secretary to the treasury had not seen his way to be more generous in that matter was a poor contribution out of the exchequer for the relief of distress it was not what they might have expected from a great country and he thought that they should have received a sum equal to the emergency say it would not ruin england to give a grant of that kind and the advantage and benefit of it to the poor fishermen on the western coast of ireland would render them perfectly satisfied upon studying the question he had become so convinced of the great necessity that existed for a larger sum of money to be expended that he had placed upon the notice paper the previous night a new clause in order to enable the sum of to be given for that purpose out of the church surplus fund and he hoped that when the time came for considering that clause the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland mr forster would see his way to agree to it he knew of no purpose to which the church surplus fund could be better put than in national works of that kind and thus to improve the industrial resources of the country and increase the wage earning power and so relieve those who were then dependent upon relief committees for their daily bread he had merely referred incidentally to his own clause which he hoped to introduce looking at the history of the distress in ireland he was afraid to think what the state of things would have been had it not been for the magnificent contributions they had received from the united states and far off australia he trusted that the government would not limit their contributions to the miserable grant of mr parnell said what would be the effect of adopting the first amendment and not the second one it appeared to him in that case the work would be stopped and not proceeded with mr parnell moved in sub section after the word money to insert under the provisions of this section mr parnell said he wished to move the rejection of sub section mr parnell would move to omit those words it was not necessary to go over the arguments which had already been adduced in favour of placing upon the consolidated fund the difference between two rates of interest but an important alteration had been made by the amendment of the chief secretary under the belief bill of last session the money borrowed by boards of guardians for the purposes of out door relief was borrowed from the exchequer it was now proposed to be borrowed from the irish church fund and to that he objected he wished to have it borrowed as it was now from the imperial funds mr parnell said there might have been a loss to the public funds independent of the interest which by the change would now have to be borne by the church surplus fund it sometimes happened and it might happen in this case that some of the boards of guardians might not be able to repay the loans and to that extent the church surplus fund would be a loser instead of the exchequer to that extent a difference had been caused by the adoption of the clause of the right hon gentleman under the act of last session if any board of guardians became bankrupt as they did in so as to be tillable to repay the advances to the treasury the public funds would have been the loser but now under the alteration made by the right hon gentleman the church surplus fund would be the loser he trusted the right hon gentleman would consider the advisability of inserting a new clause by which the risk of that loss might be taken from that fund it was manifestly not fair to put it upon it for it was not originally intended to do so it was decided in the last act that the money should be lent out of the consolidated fund and consequently it should bear any loss that might possibly result from the non payment of the boards of guardians he mr parnell thought it would be fair under all the circumstances to propose a new clause which would prevent such loss being thrown upon the church surplus fund mr parnell moved after clause to insert the following clauses the commissioners of public works may from time to time out of the said sum of one million five hundred thousand pounds payable to them by the commissioners of church temporalities apply any sums not exceeding in all the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds for the purposes of the fishery piers act to be expended in the manner therein mentioned but subject to the conditions and exceptions hereinafter mentioned upon the publication by the commissioners in the dublin gazette or otherwise as they shall think fit of a notice of their intention to undertake any work which may be executed under the fishery piers act such notice shall be instead of and shall have all the force and effect of the final notice mentioned in the sixteenth section of the fishery piers act before publishing such notice the commissioners may if they think fit do any matter or thing and shall have and may if they think tit exercise any right power or authority in connection with such work which they might do or would have with reference to any of the proceedings preliminary to the publication of the final notice mentioned in the fishery piers act if the work were undertaken in strict compliance with the said act the provisions contained in the following sections of the fishery piers act that is to say section four sub section four section five and sections ten to fifteen both included relative to proceedings preliminary to the publication of such notice shall not apply to any such work power to undertake works at any time notice after the publication by the commissioners of public works of any such notice as is mentioned in this act the commissioners may commence and proceed with the works proposed to be executed and to which such notice relates the commissioners may if they think fit do any matter or thing and shall have and may if they think fit exercise any right power or authority with reference to such work which they might do or would have if the work were undertaken in strict compliance with the fishery piers act and all the enactments contained in that act save so far as they are modified by this act shall apply as nearly as may be with reference to any such work management and maintenance of works when constructed when such work has been constructed all the provisions of the fishery piers act and of the act of the session of parliament held in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the reign of her present majesty chapter one hundred and thirty six as amended by any act or acts shall apply to such work as if it was a pier constructed in strict compliance with the fishery piers act the hon member said he trusted the government would carry out the new clause he had placed upon the paper last night he regretted he was unable to give longer notice but he had intended to bring in a bill in reference to the matter and finally came to the conclusion it would be more convenient to propose a clause in connection with the bill under discussion the committee was aware they had agreed to grant the sum of out of the imperial exchequer in aid of the construction of fishery piers and harbours on the west coast of ireland as many as piers and harbours had been recommended by the commissioners as urgently required and in order really to develop the harbours and piers on the west and south coasts of ireland it was necessary that they should have a very much larger grant he asked by these clauses to allow them to have some of the church surplus fund for that natural object the hon member for the county waterford mr blake who was for many years inspector of fisheries in ireland and had fulfilled his duties in a most satisfactory manner had assisted him mr parnell in framing these clauses and from his practical knowledge of the operation of the fishery piers act of he assured him that they would work perfectly with that act they would enable the board of works in ireland to undertake the construction of fishery piers and harbours which they could undertake by the act of without the necessity of any local contribution the act of allocated a grant of for fishery piers and harbours in the west it provided that a contribution of one fourth was necessary from local sources that had usually been found by baronial grants but owing to the repugnance of the ratepayers to burden themselves more it had been impossible to get these he proposed to dispense with the necessity of a fourth and the red tape required by the act of and enable the board of works to undertake the construction of the fishery piers and harbours which were so much needed he had every confidence in recommending the application of some of the church surplus fund for this purpose it would be most difficult to point out a work more urgently needed than the construction of these harbours it was quite impossible to hope that they could be constructed without this system for the west coast of ireland was far removed from civilization it had no resident landlords and the people were left in a sort of wild state to subsist in the best way they could without anyone to look after their interests and it would be of the greatest advantage to the teeming population if a grant such as he proposed were made to get on with some of the piers and harbours which had been recommended by the fishery inspectors some of the piers and harbours constructed in had fallen out of repair and were now useless so that very much was needed to develop the fisheries he asked the committee with the utmost confidence to agree to the second reading the irish members he believed were almost unanimous in its favour and thought that no application of the money would be more advantageous to the country new clause mr parnell brought up and read a first time motion made and question proposed that the clause be now read a second time mr parnell thought there was some force in the objections which had been urged on the other side to grants being taken at such short notice more especially as it would appear to raise the question of the allocating of the church surplus funds and their distribution among the industries of ireland but the proposition of the hon member for lei trim mr tottenham did not fall under these objections the amount which had been allocated by this bill one of the most useful the bill contained next to that of for assisting the poor law unions in giving out door relief that for harbours and fishery piers was a very small one and when that question was under discussion the irish members urged the desirability of increasing it this was impressed on the government but the noble lord the secretary to the treasury was unwilling he said in view of the budget proposals to recommend an increase taken with the liverpool and the canadian funds it would amount to this was a very small thing for the assistance of the fisheries of the west coast it would go a very little way and he was afraid it would raise expectations among the fishermen which in nine cases out of ten would be doomed to disappointment now if power were given to the commissioners to take from the church surplus fund in addition to the already granted for piers and harbours it would make something of a little gift to the west coast fisheries although there was a great deal of force in the objection of the hon member for limerick mr synan that a considerable portion of this must go in materials though not so much as he seemed to think yet nothing he mr parnell believed would do more to relieve the poverty and privations during the coming winter than affording such facilities to these fishing stations in many instances they had no harbours but only little boat slips it would encourage the men to hold on and fight through the winter he would ask the right hon gentleman to consider this he did not know whether it was the intention to finish the bill that night but if not he would ask leave to withdraw his clause for the present in order that it might be fully considered in the interval between then and the next sitting of the committee that the right hon gentleman might consider whether or not he would give say so as to make something of a little gift to these little harbours of the west coast this would not trench much on the church surplus and it would be something out of the which he felt sure would do a great deal of good the question had been thoroughly inquired into the harbours were well known the board of works would know perfectly well where the works were to be constructed and he felt sure it would be an enormous assistance mr parnell said yes he proposed to withdraw his clauses in order to give the right hon gentleman a little time for consideration for a very short notice had been given of them mr parnell did not think the clause as moved would be found of a workable description in order to set it in motion some scheme would have to be provided at all events the outlines of the scheme would have to be embodied in a set of clauses for it would be quite impossible to set in motion the clause as it stood he had been thinking about the best means of meeting the object of the clause and had intended if it had not been so late in the season if the urgency had not been so great and if they had not had other concessions of a valuable character from the right hon gentleman he had intended to move a set of clauses in the bill which would have enabled the committee at all events to discuss the subject properly however he did not wish to detain the committee with the clauses he had proposed to move he would have constituted the county surveyor to assist in conjunction with the poor law boards in the machinery for carrying into effect the provisions of the clause he would have proposed that power should be given to boards of guardians to make advances to occupiers of land and that they should borrow money to be so advanced on the security of the rates and that the money should be recovered from occupiers in the shape of rates therefore this money would be the first charge on their holdings he would propose that the county surveyor should be appointed as the authority for checking the poor law boards in their allocation of the advances that would have given the county surveyor the veto as regarded any work proposed he had the clauses there but he did not propose to read them for he had abandoned all intention of moving them some time ago but in that way a simple machinery would be provided for carrying into effect the object of the hon member for waterford county mr villiers stuart the county surveyor acting as a check on the poor law board as to the work to be undertaken but now as the season had got so late it would be useless for immediate relief and as he was assured that should the distress continue next winter the chief secretary for ireland intended to adopt sweeping measures to cope with it then there would be an opportunity of raising the question again he did not see the slightest practical use in persevering with the clause now mr parnell said it might be left until the time came for dealing with the clause of the hon member for limerick mr synan that was the only other important clause on the paper with the exception of the suspension of ejectments clause in the name of the hon member for cavan mr biggar which he mr parnell thought had better be left to be moved as an amendment to the government land bill so far as he could see the only important part of the business remaining was the clause of his hon friend but of course if a discussion was raised upon that they ought not to go on that night mr parnell said before coming to those clauses there was an important point to be settled in reference to the seeds act he believed the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland mr w e forster undertook to bring up a new clause mr parnell said there was also the hon member for limerick mr synan's clause as to limitation of time and his mr parnell's own little matter about the he supposed the right hon gentleman did not intend to finish the committee that night and therefore he would be content to allow the three questions he had named to remain until the committee resumed he therefore now moved to report progress motion made and question proposed that the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again mr parnell mr parnell inquired whether it would be possible to move any other clauses when the committee resumed mr parnell said it was only minutes past and he thought they might go on with the registration of voters ireland bill and take a step in that and there was also the municipal franchise ireland bill they were both opposed orders and if they had not an opportunity of taking them now they might not be able to get them any other night\n",

      "mr parnell said the hon member for liskeard mr courtney had made a charge against the irish fishermen that charge had not been made for the first time against irishmen engaged in different pursuits he had heard it said often in connection with the manufacturing industry or want of such industry in ireland that they could not succeed because they were deficient in the characteristics which englishmen and scotchmen possessed but it was a very remarkable fact that this deficiency in moral character did not pursue the irish people out of their own country for in canada australia the united states and other countries to which they emigrated they were succeeding in a very striking manner considering the difficulties with which they had to contend in all the pursuits in which they were engaged that was an indisputable fact the house had to consider how it was that irishmen who succeeded in other parts of the world were unable to succeed in their own country the hon member for liskeard had pointed out that in cromwell days the cornish fishermen went to fish at waterford and that ever since the cornishmen had shown themselves better adapted to fish than irishmen but what was the reason in the days of cromwell fishermen of cornwall presented a petition to cromwell stating that by reason of the great competition from irish fishermen cornish fishermen were not able to compete successfully with fishermen on the irish coast and they begged that irishmen might not be allowed to fish in irish waters in accordance with their prayer cromwell issued orders forbidding irishmen to fish in irish waters but that was not all such as were caught doing so after the issuing of the edict were made slaves and sent to the west indies that was the history of the competition of cornishmen with irish fishermen and that was the foundation of the superiority which the hon member for liskeard claimed for cornish over irish fishermen cornishmen got the start and they were able to keep it ever since owing to legislation of that kind the irish fisheries had been depressed from time to time by english legislation and if parliament was asked to put aside a little the principles of political economy now it was because they had much more rudely put aside the principles of political economy in their dealings with irishmen in times past he admitted that state loans to fishermen were objectionable as a permanent means of supporting their industry but irishmen had been crippled by several famines by the notable famine of just when irish fisheries were beginning to flourish and again another calamity had come which bad thrown irish fishermen back in the competition with other fishermen he thought if a moderate loan could be made by the state to fishermen in ireland the result would be the establishment of a larger class of boats which would enable them to compete with cornish and scotch fishermen who were evidently alarmed at the prospect of competition from irish fishermen from the way in which they had set the hon member for liskeard against the bill advances previously made had done a great deal of good considering the limited extent to which they were made and had been punctually repaid the moderate loans now asked for would of course be on good security with regard to harbours he would ask the chief secretary whether a limited grant could not be made out of the church surplus fund in addition to that made by the treasury for the purpose of giving harbours on the west coast which would be of great utility the board of works had already sufficient information to justify the expenditure of or with great advantage and there would be no possible risk of the money being wasted he trusted therefore that they should have the support of members representing english and scotch fishing constituencies in the matter he might mention there were no harbours as yet on the western coast of ireland with the exception of the harbour of kinsale the coast of ireland consisted of over miles and only about miles were at present fished by the cornish and english fishermen simply for the want of harbours if then they could expend or so as to extend the fisheries the food production would be materially increased had irishmen a parliament of their own they would be able to provide these things for themselves therefore the government should go a little in the direction in which the irish members asked them to go if the government could not see their way to a second reading of the bill he hoped they would entertain an application for an additional grant of out of the irish church surplus for the purpose of small fishery harbours and piers on the western coast of ireland that would enable irish fishermen to struggle on until the time came when the right hon gentleman would be able to consider this question in all its bearings and bring forward some comprehensive policy with regard to the subject\n",

      "mr parnell said that the hon member for south northumberland was not the first member of the ancient house of grey who had done good service to the enemies of popular rights and progress by attacking from the liberal ranks measures designed for the advancement of the liberal cause he regretted that the hon member on almost his first appearance should have undertaken to defend a system which all careful observers admitted to have been the proximate cause of irish famines ever since they had a land system he did not however propose to follow the hon member in his able arguments against the bill because he thought that on this occasion he had been flogging a dead horse and that the task he had undertaken in view of what had happened since yesterday morning was a work of supererogation up to yesterday morning he mr parnell intended to vote for the motion that the speaker leave the chair on the committee stage of the bill but an amendment on the paper yesterday under the name of the attorney general for ireland had entirely changed his mind and he could not now take the responsibility of voting or wasting the time of the house upon consideration of a measure which if the intentions of the government were carried out as of course they would be supported with their large majority would simply result in the passing of a useless measure he would have voted for the bill as it was printed he understood the bill to be an attempt to prevent the spirit of the land act from being infringed in the exceptional circumstances prevailing in ireland it was proposed to do that by carrying out the spirit of the 9th section of the act of as it left that house and went up to the house of lords the chief secretary and also the prime minister had shown their desire to prevent the landlords from inflicting a wrong upon their tenants the bill was indeed inadequate but still he should have supported it but the attorney general amendment had entirely changed the character of the bill and it was no longer an attempt to carry out the principle of the 9th section of the land act but to amend the 13th section in such a way as to defeat in some cases the tenant claim to compensation in his opinion this bill would be utterly useless to effect the object which the government when they introduced it said they had in view it was now proposed to change the entire scope of the bill by the amendment of the attorney general for ireland he asked the house whether it was worth while worth all the time spent on the bill and all the fuss that had been made about it to arrive at such an impotent conclusion if the wish of the government was not that which they expressed namely to protect the tenants who were unable to pay rent but to get rid of this exception to the right of sale he submitted it would have been better to have introduced a bill for that purpose and not to have introduced a bill for an entirely different purpose as the bill was now proposed to be altered the bill did not protect the tenant it gave the landlord the right to evict and the tenant the right of sale they knew that these small tenants had no saleable interest how could they expect anyone to buy a small farm which was screwed down by a rack rent from the nature of the case the tenant would have no interest to sell on account of his having to pay a crushing rent if they brought forward on the other hand a bill to extend the ulster custom to the whole of ireland as a permanent enactment he would admit that that would be a measure worthy of consideration and he should vote for it but he should not accept it as a final settlement nor as a settlement in part of the vast questions connected with irish land the amendment of the attorney general for ireland would benefit a large class of large tenants who were in a different position altogether from the small farmers tenants whom the landlords did not desire to lose it would give this class the right and the valuable right of sale in their holdings if the rent of such holdings was low and the landlord was a good landlord then the tenant would have something valuable to sell but if the rent was high and the landlord a bad landlord this right of sale would be worth nothing at all he wished to point out the direction in which they were drifting owing to the impressionable nature of the government he did not know whether it was by the pressure from behind or before whether it was by pressure from above or another place that this extraordinary change of flank was brought about but whatever the motive he would remind the chief secretary of the old maxim unstable as water thou shalt not excel it would have been better for the chief secretary to have waited for a while before making any definite announcement the bill of the hon member for mayo mr o'connor power was introduced and the chief secretary seemed to be favourably impressed but a demonstration a tergo and he dropped it like a hot potato now they found that another change of front had been executed and the government was going to enact something entirely different from its original idea and which something would not have the slightest effect for the protection of small tenants in the west of ireland it followed of course on this amendment that the whole of the land question would have to be discussed the partial failure of the ulster custom would render it necessary to introduce amendments they knew that bad landlords in ulster made the custom there of no use and only recently the hon member for tyrone mr macartney proposed a bill on the subject the government said they could not go into that question at present and he agreed with them but now the government by this amendment had raised the whole question and it would be absolutely necessary if this bill reached committee to move amendments in the direction of the bill of the hon member for tyrone he maintained that this bill as now altered would result in either filling the poor house or the emigrant ship he could not imagine any more disastrous step than that which the government had taken they were extending the principle of free sale and putting it on its trial for a purpose for which it was never intended and for which it was entirely useless they were told there had been no anti rent disturbances in ulster and that that was due to the ulster custom but the ulster custom had done its work gradually and owing to its operation it had become a recognized principle that the landlord should not raise his rent beyond a certain point and that a certain saleable interest should be left to the tenant he regretted exceedingly that the government did not stand to their colours perhaps they were afraid that the bill would be thrown out in another place well he was perfectly willing to face that contingency no great cause was ever won without suffering and the irish people if they were determined to obtain a satisfactory solution of the land question must be ready to suffer they had suffered in the past and they would have to suffer still if the house of lords in had not mutilated that 9th section he believed that the present pressure in ireland would never have arisen a sort of custom would have grown up by which the landlords would have been restrained by the courts from raising rents to an undue height but the house of lords deliberately cut the section out and altered the act and the consequence had been that the people had been driven from the courts and had to rely on organization and agitation the right hon gentleman the chief secretary had now been urged by some members on the conservative side to sit on the safety valve and he had done it if the result should be that the engineer was hoist by his own petard the weakness and vacillation he had shown would not entitle him to any sympathy mr parnell said he did not say he should oppose the bill what he said was that he should consider it perfectly useless unless with the amendment of the attorney general for ireland mr parnell said that he wished to announce very briefly the reasons which would induce him and a number of other irish members to leave the house without taking any part in the division on the motion that mr speaker leave the chair they felt that the bill had assumed an entirely new phase and aspect and it would be quite impossible for them to sanction the motion for going into committee on the bill as it had now been interpreted by the government and as it had been further interpreted by the amendment which the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland mr law had placed upon the paper they believed that the bill according to the construction now placed upon it by the government would not be a bill for establishing the principles of free sale in ireland but for establishing the principle of forced sale and that at a most disadvantageous time for the tenant advocate as he was of the principle of free sale he could not consent to have the term used for a purpose and in a way which none of its advocates ever intended it should be used therefore they felt that while they could not undertake the responsibility of voting against the motion for going into committee neither could they undertake the responsibility of voting for the motion hear hear the right hon gentleman the prime minister cried hear hear he mr parnell could assure the right hon gentleman he had felt very strongly impelled to vote against the motion that mr speaker do now leave the chair and certainly if the amendment of the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland were inserted in the bill he should join the tory party in doing his best to throw it out on the third reading he however believed that the conservative party when that amendment had been inserted would not be so anxious as they now were to prevent the further progress of the measure in that shape he felt confident that the bill would produce more extermination and eviction in ireland more outrage and crime than anything that had been done for years\n",

      "mr parnell said that no one regretted more than he did the course that they would be compelled to take by the action of the government it would have the effect of delaying more or less many valuable measures which were in progress none of his hon friends wished to keep back the various measures but they wished to do all they could to support the measures which had been brought in by the government it was idle to charge them with obstruction when they had waited until the last days of the session to commence a course of obstruction if they had desired to obstruct they would have commenced work long ago he did think that many members of that house did not fully realize the grave situation which at present existed in ireland he had failed to perceive from the public utterances of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary that he himself appreciated the circumstances he thought from his general bearing that if he were really acquainted with what had been done during the course of the winter he would not hesitate to get parliament together during the autumn when it would be necessary to send another bill back to the house of lords what were the facts with regard to the tenantry in the west of ireland he had his information from a gentleman constantly going over that district he was credibly informed that half the tenantry of ireland were under ejectment these ejectments would be stayed until the harvest was gathered in and a contest arose between the rival creditors of the unfortunate tenants these creditors were not only the landlords but frequently bankers and shopkeepers it would take three harvests instead of one to pay one half of what the majority of the tenants owed that was the position before the tenantry of the west of ireland at the present moment the right hon gentleman brought in his bill a very insufficient protection it was but he failed to carry it he now proposed to let the house rise and he gave no assurance of what he was going to do to meet the situation he himself had made a re assuring statement but after private communications with the attorney general for ireland he did his best to diminish the force of his observations that was the situation before them and it was a situation of enormous gravity and one which entitled them to some consideration from the government in the matter if the peasantry of the west of ireland were slaughtered he would tell the english liberal members that their blood would be upon their head those who had lived amongst the people as the hon member for the county of galway mr t p o'connor had done for the last two years and had witnessed their sufferings had told them of the actual state of affairs and it should be remembered that he spoke with knowledge and experience of what was going on it seemed to him that the testimony of one who had spent his daily life amongst those suffering people was better entitled to be heard with regard to their condition than those who were unacquainted with it mr parnell said that if he might make an observation it would be this it seemed to him that the government were not acting reasonably in asking them to go on with business after a certain time that was after o'clock it had always been the recognized custom in the house that when a minority was asked to go on with the business after a reasonable time it was entitled to use the forms of the house in order to protect itself from the majority the forms of the house were given to minorities in order that they might use them for their protection from arbitrary or unjust or hasty action on the part of majorities now he and his hon friends thought that the action of the government in endeavouring to force them to proceed with the discussion of these estimates after o'clock was of an arbitrary character and that that was why they felt entitled to use the forms of the house for their protection for his part he had no objection to resume the discussion of the estimates after a few hours sleep and when what they had to say could be reported to the outside world he desired to point out though he did not wish to lay too much stress on the matter that he had not spoken on the question yet he thought he was entitled to speak upon it and at a time when what he said could be reported there were several of his hon friends in the same position if the government would now agree to report progress he would be glad to resume the discussion of the estimates at the usual morning sitting he could not see what reasonable objection the government could urge to such a proposal mr parnell said an hour and a half ago he had made a proposal to the government which was not accepted in making that proposal a second time he would only express his regret that these proceedings had taken place and he could assure the noble lord that from every point of view he had made a great mistake in taking up the attitude he had assumed the proceedings of that evening were extremely disagreeable to him and he much regretted that no way had been found out of the situation he could not however take any part of the blame for those disagreeable proceedings upon himself he thought the noble lord had taken upon himself as leader of the house a more headstrong course than he was entitled to pursue and that in imputing motives to some hon members he had exceeded the rules of conduct sanctioned by the rules of the committee they desired the government to allow them to proceed with the debate on the estimates at a time when they could be properly and legitimately discussed there was not and could not be any foundation for the suggestion of the noble lord that any attempt had been made or that any intention existed to obstruct the police and constabulary votes the noble lord himself was responsible for compelling the irish members to use the forms of the house for the protection of the interests they had at heart he seemed to suppose that if he had agreed to their request the same thing might have taken place at the end of the next night in supply as had taken place last night he could not understand how the noble lord still less the chief secretary for ireland could have made such a suggestion irish members had kept faith with the government both in letter and spirit it was the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the dublin university mr gibson who had originated a discussion in which he mr parnell would like to have joined but he had refrained from doing so in order not to break the spirit of the engagement entered into and the understanding arrived at what ground then had the noble lord for the statement which he now made that they had formed the intention to obstruct the police vote that was to say to debate them unduly he would candidly admit that at one time previously to the statement of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland he had entertained the idea of using the forms of the house to their fullest extent but he had abandoned it on hearing the speech of the right hon gentleman the government must have known that the irish members did not intend to discuss the vote on tuesday and yet in face of that knowledge both the chief secretary and the noble lord rose and made these assertions now he submitted that this was neither fair nor worthy treatment on the part of those right hon gentlemen to extend to irish members they were told that they must not use the forms of the house but he could assure the government that when they fettered irish members in this way and prevented their enjoying the same freedom and liberties as the english members they were taking one step to render it impossible for ireland to continue to send her members here to claim any sort of justice whatever he trusted that this disagreeable scene would be allowed to terminate and that the discussion might be resumed at a time when hon members could do their duty and when the public could be made to understand what was the actual position of irish members with regard to this vote mr parnell said it must be obvious to the hon member who had made this suggestion and to the chief secretary who had repeated it that he could enter into no such bargain in the absence of his hon friends he could not even say that he could approve of such a bargain being entered into for it would be grossly false on his part to undertake to do anything of the sort he and his hon friends acted in consultation with each other and they only acted after full consultation with each other it had always been his boast that he had never yet done anything contrary to the opinion of the party with which he had the honour to act and therefore to ask him at a moment notice to make a bargain of this kind in the absence of many of his friends who had just as much right to be consulted as he had was practically absurd he could only say if the proposition was repeated on the return of those who were entitled to be consulted that he should be happy to consider it he should only like to point out however to the hon member for liskeard mr courtney that he was not very fortunate in his interpretation of the rights of minorities in fact his evidence on this subject was opposed to the evidence given by mr raikes the late chairman of committees before the select committee on the subject in which he plainly intimated that the use of the forms of the house by minorities on the occasion of the obstruction to the sunday closing act was not in his opinion such a use in the forms of the house by minorities as could be called an abuse of them he recollected upon that occasion which was an all night sitting when motions to report progress were made in great frequency that the hon member got up and made a speech similar to that he had delivered that night he told them then that he was a great supporter of the rights of minorities and that he viewed this kind of work with dread and that it would tend to restrict those rights it was exactly the same kind of speech as that which the hon gentleman had just made now when he had told them that the use of the forms of the house which they were making was a use which the minority were not entitled to make when however mr raikes the late chairman of committees was subsequently examined on this question by the noble lord the present leader of the house and the noble lord asked him whether this opposition was not an opposition by about the same minority as theirs that night which could be called obstructive or an abuse of the forms of the house mr raikes distinctly gave it as his opinion upon that occasion that the opposition which the hon member for liskeard had stigmatised as an abuse of the rights of minorities was not so but was on the contrary a perfectly justifiable use of them so that they had on the one hand the opinion of the hon member for liskeard and on the other the opinion of mr raikes who was called before the select committee on public business as the especial and official witness of the late government for the purpose of giving his opinion upon which a certain rule was framed this was very remarkable as showing that the hon member for liskeard was not such an authority in regard to the rights of minorities as he would have hon members suppose his opinion was directly contradicted by the opinion of the late chairman of committees of that house a gentleman whom no one would say was not infinitely better acquainted with the forms of the house and with the powers and rights of that assembly mr parnell said he had already stated his proposition two or three times and his experience in regard to it upon the last occasion was not a happy one because his words were taken hold of by the hon member for northampton and misrepresented in a way which to him was exceedingly painful however he would repeat over again what he had asked the government to accept at o'clock just three hours ago he suggested that if progress were reported they would be very happy to go on with the discussion of the items in the vote at the commencement of the business in the usual way they proposed that in order to show that they did not care and did not wish to obstruct the progress of business if the government would agree to report progress and fix their sitting in the usual way he and his hon friends would be very glad to proceed with the discussion of the estimates and to a fair and bond fide discussion of those estimates mr parnell said that a proposition had been made to them by the government that he should ask his hon friend the member for galway city whether he was willing to postpone his motion standing on the paper for friday night in the event of the government consenting to report progress then and putting the constabulary estimates down as the first order for friday night at o'clock he might say that he had communicated with his hon friend and would leave him to speak for himself on that matter in the event of his complying with the request he wished his mr parnell's position in the matter to be clearly understood he trusted that in the few words which he was going to say there might be no misapprehension as to the statement which he was making he had said that he was willing that progress should be reported if the government placed the constabulary votes down for some future sitting and that he should be willing and would undertake that the discussion should proceed in a fair and bond fide manner he was not to be taken as admitting for a moment that the discussion upon these estimates had up to that time not been carried on in a fair and bond fide way he must guard himself against that nor could he enter into any bargain nor could he give any undertaking or agreement in the absence of his hon friends that the estimates would be finished on that evening that was all he could say mr parnell said that it was hard for hon members to understand the position in which he was placed the arrangements which were made before mr speaker left the chair had been previously agreed to by all his hon friends and he was bound to act with the majority on this occasion he regretted very much that he could not say straight out that he would exert his influence with his colleagues in this matter he did not think it proper for him to say that he would and he could not give any further pledge than he had already given mr parnell said that he was sorry he could not add anything more to the statement he had already made he should be glad to do anything he could to lead the way out of the present difficulty he must say that it would be more satisfactory if the arrangement he had suggested were made than if they waited until his hon friends reentered the house he did not know that he ought to go any further than he had done the result was much more likely to be satisfactory if the arrangement he had suggested were carried out in the way he had suggested rather than if they waited until his hon friends came in he begged to move that the chairman do now report progress and ask leave to sit again motion made and question proposed that the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again mr parnell mr parnell said his difficulty was that he could not in the absence of his hon friends appear to lay down a policy or come to a decision it would not be fair or right to them he did not in their absence like to lay down any particular course for it would be an indication on his part in their absence of deciding upon a particular course mr parnell said that in saying he could not undertake to use his influence he wished to be understood only as saying that he could not make any declarations to the committee of what course he should take mr parnell said the minority maintained that they were entitled to use the forms of the house for the purpose of insuring to themselves another opportunity of discussing the irish estimates that opportunity had been refused to them by the government and the last attempt made to bring about a compromise in that direction had failed although the hon member for galway mr t p o'connor had offered to give place to the government on friday provided the estimates were put down for that day the government had refused to accede to this proposal unless some irish members gave a pledge that they would use their influence with other irish members to get them to allow the estimates to go through on that evening he felt that such a pledge could not be honourably given in the absence of the irish members interested and therefore the attempted compromise had fallen through and matters stood as they were he regretted exceedingly that the compromise had not been accepted and thought that the government would have to reconsider the matter mr parnell said if he was in order he was going to suggest that progress should be reported temporarily in order that they might have a statement upon this subject and then afterwards committee might be resumed of course then the question would remain unchanged as to what the committee proposed to do with reference to this business the situation was unchanged as far as he and his hon friends were concerned although many of them had been deprived of their rest and sleep by the action of the government action which as they submitted was utterly unnecessary for the purpose which they had in view the expedition of public business business which he would maintain would be better provided for according to their motion to report progress had that been agreed to at o'clock they would have been enabled to go away and to come back ready to consider the votes fairly that evening instead of being in a position in which they did not know exactly how they stood propositions were made before the noble lord returned to his place of such a charater sic as to be satisfactory to himself and not merely to himself but to some hon members on the side of the noble lord so much so that several who had been supporters of the noble lord during the night in the division lobby voted with him in one division and afterwards refused to take any farther part in supporting the government that was a very remarkable fact and should be made known because it should be understood that the responsibility of rejecting the proposal he had made rested upon the government mr parnell said it originated in a request from him the proposition they then made was of such a character as to induce a considerable number of members mr warton no only four who had been supporting the chief secretary for ireland to show that they thought his offer was a reasonable one and ought to be accepted so much did they think so that they retired from the committee and refused to support the government any longer it was desirable that that statement should go forth in order to show how thoroughly they had put themselves in the right during that night and how willing they had shown themselves to be to agree to any compromise that could honourably be accepted he regretted that that compromise had not been accepted because the result was that they stood where they were now mr parnell said as there seemed to be some inexplicable desire on the part of right hon gentlemen on the treasury bench to hear once again a proposition which he had several times already made and which as he thought was thoroughly understood by the right hon gentleman the chief secretary and which he certainly might communicate to the noble lord by his side as he did not wish to appear discourteous in refusing the request of so many hon members who had not been there during the night and were desirous of learning what was proposed he would only say that his proposition was that the government should report progress and that his hon friend the member for the city of galway mr t p o'connor having agreed to postpone his motion in favour of the government and the hon member for the county of louth mr callan having also agreed to postpone his motion in favour of the government that then supply should be put down he forgot the exact words that he used but he believed he said that they would then proceed with a fair and bond fide discussion of the question at the same time he could not answer for the hon members who were absent and he could not say for them in consequence that the votes would be finished on friday night mr parnell said he hoped he might interpose for a moment he thought the hon and learned member would see that after he had been explaining his proposal made during the night in the absence of the noble lord it was scarcely for the hon and learned member to criticize his conduct in repeating to the best of his recollection the proposition he originally made mr parnell was sorry that he had not responded earlier to the invitation of his hon friend the member for salford mr arthur arnold he had wished before doing so to see how the matter was going he had now had an opportunity of consulting with many of his friends and he found that their opinion was almost if not entirely universal that the constabulary estimates were of such a nature that they could not enter into any undertaking or understanding with regard to them and now with regard to the question of another sitting he very much feared that a o'clock friday sitting would not end satisfactorily to either party but he was free to say that he had no moral doubt whatever that an arrangement might be come to if the government could see their way to giving a full evening sitting for the discussion of these estimates a discussion in which he would hope that some of the english members would join and give them the benefit of their opinion on these votes for it had been one of the most painful things to the irish members and one of those matters that made them feel almost hopeless to see the alacrity with which the english members refused to join in any debate and accused the irish members of obstructing the business of the house simply because they were desirous of bringing their grievances under the consideration of the house unfortunately they had found themselves thwarted and hampered by the want of co operation manifested by the english members he had now a question to put which was this he felt sure and had no moral doubt whatever as he had already said although he should not and could not enter into any understanding or agreement but he had no moral doubt that if the government could see their way to affording another evening sitting that the time thus given up would be sufficient for the discussion of the constabulary vote mr parnell asked if the noble lord could not take the other irish estimates at the o'clock sitting so as to give a clear day debate for the constabulary vote mr parnell and the constabulary vote on monday\n",

      "mr parnell said there were some important matters connected with this vote which he thought it would be well to mention he would refer first to the actions that were brought last year by the late government against messrs daly miller and brennan this was a proper opportunity for asking her majesty government what they proposed to do with reference to these proceedings which were still pending as far as he had been able to gather the late government brought these gentlemen before the magistrates at sligo and they were committed for trial at the sligo assizes the crown then applied to have the cases removed by writ of certiorari to dublin and consequently when the time for the trials came on no further proceedings appeared to have been taken by the crown he thought it very desirable that it should now be known whether it was intended to proceed further in the matter or not if the crown intended to proceed then the proceedings should be undertaken within some reasonable time so that these charges should not be kept hanging over the heads of the gentlemen implicated by them he therefore ventured to ask the law officers of the crown whether it was intended to proceed further with the actions which had already been commenced or not mr parnell said he understood that the members of the constabulary referred to were employed to attend certain public meetings for the purpose of informing themselves as to what took place at them no question was now raised as to the policy of the vote the hon and learned member for meath mr a m sullivan only asked for information as to the principle on which the expenses were paid perhaps the right hon and learned attorney general for ireland would not be so well able to explain the matter as the late attorney general for ireland as it was the late government that introduced the practice of employing the police in this capacity mr parnell said there was a matter connected with this business to which he wished to call the attention of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of ireland he did not deny that the government were entitled to have correct information as to what took place at the land meetings but there was another practice of a very objectionable character which prevailed throughout the country namely the practice of directing sergeants of police and other police constables to take rough notes in a notebook of statements made by public speakers and otherwise that was a much more objectionable practice from all points of view than the employment of special reporters by the police in the first place a policeman under such circumstances could not take a note that would be of any value or importance he took out a note book and scribbled down a few words in it very often hastily in the dark and the note simply represented his idea of the nature of the observations made now he did not think that that was the kind of reporting which the government ought to encourage if their object was to obtain correct information as to what might be said at a public meeting if the government desired to have reports he thought they ought to employ skilled shorthand writers as undoubtedly they had done in many cases the practice however had repeatedly been to send a sergeant of police who stood in the crowd and scribbled down a few words under the most unfavourable circumstances just as he happened in the most fragmentary way to catch them this was an objectionable practice from more points of view than one in the first place when the people saw a sergeant of police or a constable produce his notebook for the purpose of taking notes they were apt to look upon him as a sort of spy and if he was standing in a crowd unsupported by his friends there was to some extent a temptation to molest the officer in the execution of his duty although it appeared to him mr parnell that it was a duty which was entirely unnecessary he had often himself in travelling about the country had to say a few words to the people and he had soon the police enter the crowd take out a note book and commence to jot down what he was saying someone in the crowd was immediately tempted to jog his elbow and a dispute and a disturbance might under such circumstances very easily arise if the government wanted reporters there was no reason why they should not have them but the reports should be taken by regular shorthand writers he was strongly of opinion that the system adopted of placing note books in the hands of the police under these circumstances was wrong and ought to be discontinued mr parnell said he wished to ask whether it was not the fact that there was no single item similar to the one for the defence of magistrates and others in the english or scotch estimates and he also wished to know whether english and scotch magistrates against whom actions were brought had not to pay the costs themselves mr parnell said that if they wished to test the principle would it not be better for his hon and learned friend to move to omit sub head h mr parnell said he had intended to direct the attention of the committee to the conduct of the stipendiary magistrate who was supposed to have given the order to fire on the catholic procession at dungannon but on consideration he had thought that his speech would perhaps come better into the discussion on the constabulary vote therefore he proposed to make a suggestion to the government which might perhaps avoid a lengthened discussion hereafter there was a good deal of feeling with reference to that matter certain catholic processionists were celebrating the day at dungannon when they were attacked by orangemen the police appear to have fired on the processionists although it had been stated that no stones were thrown by the processionists after the attack it seemed remarkable that when the procession had been broken up by the mob the policemen whose duty it was to protect the processionists as long as they behaved themselves should have killed a number of people who sympathized with the procession while he believed none of the attacking party was injured he would suggest to the government that they would issue a commission of inquiry into the circumstances which appeared to be exceedingly serious he could not help thinking that after the way in which the attention of the right hon gentleman had been called to that case and the hint thrown out he would not fail to take action as regarded inquiry into the matter at any rate he certainly thought it most desirable that the government should see who was responsible for the order to fire mr parnell said there were one or two questions he wished to ask in the report of the royal commission it was recommended that an independent inspection should be provided for convict prisons and a number of gentlemen of high position and character had been appointed to that office for england and scotland he wished to ask the chief secretary for ireland whether similar steps were being taken in ireland and if not whether he intended to take the matter into consideration he should be glad to see gentlemen selected who would take an interest in the subject and who were able to afford the time for proper inspection mr parnell said that he had omitted to ask a question he ought to have given notice of it but he only asked it in order that the matter might be considered before the next time it came up under the irish prison law flogging was not permitted while it was permitted in england they found that they were able to get on very well and enforce the discipline of gaols without that punishment but in military prisons in ireland the prisoners could be flogged for breaches of prison discipline an inspecting officer could give the order for a prisoner to be flogged while a civilian could not be he wished to ask whether the government would consider the desirability of extending the exemption to the military prisons which prevailed in the civil prisons possibly the fact of the abolition of that punishment in the army and navy would have some effect in the prisons also he believed there was a pretty general feeling against the maintenance of that punishment and he therefore did trust that the government would consider whether they could not abolish it from the military gaols of ireland\n",

      "mr parnell said that he found that their position with reference to these constabulary votes had been somewhat misunderstood and he wished to recall to the recollection of the committee the statement which he made at the conclusion of business when progress was about to be reported upon this vote on friday morning last the statement was this that he had found the almost unanimous opinion amongst irish members to be that the constabulary estimates were of such a character that no undertaking or understanding could be entered into with regard to them they also felt that the result of resuming the discussion on friday evening would not be satisfactory for their purposes at the same time he felt no moral doubt that if progress was then reported and the discussion resumed at the commencement of the monday sitting that that would be deemed a sufficient discussion he would draw the attention of the committee to this statement for he had seen it extensively stated in the newspapers that they had entered into an engagement to close the discussion that night that was the thing they had always avoided doing they found that they could not do it for they felt that it would be adopting the principles of the cloture with regard to irish discussions and there was no precedent for such a course he wished however to state his belief that the discussion that evening would be sufficient to enable them to come to a division upon the estimates he wished also further to say that subsequently to a speech which the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland delivered on tuesday the irish members abandoned their intention to use the forms of the house to oppose the vote up to that time he admitted that they all considered in view of the entire absence of any statement of the right hon gentleman to the effect that justice would be accompanied by mercy or that if parliament were called together to renew the coercion act that it would also be called together to prevent the injustice to irish tenants he felt it would be their duty to use all the forms of the house against the vote but after the statement of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland on tuesday last they considered that two nights discussion would be sufficient for the purpose of putting the ground of their sic opposition to these estimates before the english public perhaps he might also refer to the criticism upon their opposition which was made by the hon member for northampton mr labouchere he seemed to think that they would have been justified in doing what they did on thursday night or rather on friday morning and if they had determined to use all the forms of the house against these votes for the purpose of entirely opposing them but that they were doing an exceedingly disgraceful thing in using the rights of the minority for the purpose of only obtaining another day discussion he would remind the hon member for northampton that this was a question upon which the irish members were responsible to their constituents alone for their actions when they did come to a determination to take a certain course with reference to these votes he considered and his hon friends with whom he acted thought that they should do all they could to secure that action being successful they desired a second night debate upon those constabulary estimates and they had therefore gained the object for which they initiated the struggle of friday morning now what he wished to do was to make certain suggestions or propositions to the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland with reference to the administration of the law in ireland during the ensuing autumn and winter and particularly with reference to the use he might have to make of the police force in that country no one could deny that the right hon gentleman stood in a most unparalleled position with reference to this vote and to the prospects before him in the coming winter he had said publicly on his authority as a responsible minister of the crown responsible for the good order and government of ireland that the late bill for compensation for disturbance ireland was necessary in order to prevent the government from being under the necessity of using the powers of the police for the purpose of assisting landlords to work injustice he qualified that statement by a further one that a very small minority of the irish landlords had committed injustice or were likely to commit injustice but at the same time the fact remained that the right hon gentleman was now asking them for a sum of money which he anticipated he would be obliged to use for the purpose of working injustice to some at all events of the tenants in ireland and for the purpose of defeating the object of the legislature as defined by the land act of he had further given them on tuesday last to understand that if he found that the landlords compelled the government to any great extent to use the law for the purpose of working injustice and if he found that he could not enforce the law by the ordinary means at the disposal of the government he would apply to parliament for fresh power and ask parliament to pass a bill which would obviate the necessity the government were under of working injustice he wished to ask the right hon gentleman how he proposed to undertake to inquire into these matters and what practical steps he proposed to take in order to obtain the information which would be necessary to ascertain whether the landlords were likely to commit injustice perhaps he was also entitled to ask him upon what principles he would proceed in making those inquiries would he consider that a landlord was inflicting injustice upon a tenant if the tenant was in a state of starvation and was turned out upon the road without any shelter or means of support would the right hon gentleman consider that a landlord was working injustice if he found that a tenant had been paying a manifestly high rent for many years and that the attempt to pay this high rent for many years had left the tenant in such a position that it would be absolutely impossible for him to pay the rent in the current season and leave enough for him to support himself during the rest of the year of course the right hon gentleman could only give them a general assurance but it was obvious that it would be necessary for him to adopt some practical machinery and he thought the irish members were entitled to have the views of the right hon gentleman in respect to these matters fully stated he would also ask him whether he would undertake to inquire so far as he could into the merits of the cases of eviction where he was asked for police assistance to enforce the process of the law previously to affording such assistance it was obvious to everybody that such an inquiry by the right hon gentleman the chief secretary would be a very material caution to the bad landlords as it would show them that their proceedings were being watched by the responsible authority and that if the responsible authority on the one hand was obliged to assist them in evicting their tenants unjustly yet on the other hand the occurrence of that injustice was known to the right hon gentleman and formed one of the grounds which would induce him to apply to parliament for a bill to protect the tenants from that injustice the knowledge that that was likely to occur would have a very important effect upon public opinion among the landlord class in ireland if the irish landlords once knew that acts of injustice inflicted by the minority amongst themselves were likely to lead to fresh legislation were likely to lead immediately to fresh legislation giving the tenantry of ireland further protection against acts of injustice he felt convinced that the public opinion of the landlord class would set itself in motion with a view of preventing those acts of injustice and preventing the minority whether large or small from so using the law as to compel the government to put a stop to their actions he would ask the right hon gentleman also whether he would consent to lay upon the table of the house a return showing the number of such cases where in his opinion after making such inquiry the enforcement of the law had been attended by practical injustice to tenants and further showing the circumstances upon which such opinion was formed and also giving the names of the landlord and tenant in each case further he would ask him whether he would agree and he looked upon this as a most important point whether he would agree largely to limit the practice of charging the cost of extra police upon particular districts or baronies with the permission of the committee he would beg leave to be allowed to say a few words with regard to this matter upon which the government had informed the house in reply to his question that they had power he was informed upon good legal authority that there was considerable doubt whether the government had power to charge the cost of the extra police drafted into a district on the report of apprehended disturbances or apprehended riots or past disturbances or crimes there was doubt whether power existed in the government under the and vict to levy the cost of such extra police upon the districts or baronies into which they might be sent he hoped that before the conclusion of these debates to hear from the law officers of the crown in ireland some explanation as to the method of procedure by which the extra cost of such police was now levied upon the ratepayers under the system in force up to the expiration of the peace preservation act the cost of the extra police was levied in a particular way and it was possible for the ratepayers upon whom the charges were levied to traverse them and to take the opinion of the courts as to their legality but he was informed that there existed no such mode of testing the legality of the charges under the present system he believed that grand juries or other bodies by whom the rates were levied might levy a rate for the cost of such extra police and that the ratepayers were absolutely unable and had no power whatever to take the opinion of any of the courts in the kingdom as to the legality of the charge in other words the rates were levied and were collectable by the whole force of the police and yet the people who had to pay them had no possibility of obtaining the opinion of the courts upon the legality of such levy the way in which those rates were levied would scarcely be believed with reference to any part of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland in the 19th century a police officer was sent down and placed himself with his iron hut upon a vacant piece of ground and levied the rate for the maintenance of himself and his men upon the inhabitants of the district or barony in which he might be he thought that when they were asked for money for the purpose of inflicting upon the people of ireland further hardships he was entitled to have some assurance from her majesty government that they would use this power with the greatest possible circumspection and that they would largely diminish the number of cases in which this tax was to be charged upon the unfortunate people in the starving districts in reply to a question put earlier in the session to the right hon gentleman asking him whether the police tax had not been levied upon certain crown lands or districts and whether three fourths of the people were not upon the relief list the right hon gentleman said that that was the case and that that was one of the reasons which induced the government not to renew the peace preservation act but it now turned out that the government had precisely the same view in respect of levying the cost of extra police under the and vict as they had under the peace preservation act although the rate was to be levied for purposes not contemplated when that statute was passed the purpose of the statute of the and vict was plain to anyone who read it it was for the purpose of enabling the government to charge the cost of extra police upon certain districts when it was found necessary to remove a portion of the force from one county to another the government now turned round and claimed the credit on the one hand for not renewing the peace preservation act and on the other declared that they had precisely the same power for levying this rate under the and vict speaking from his own experience he should say that this tax was one of the most odious that had ever been collected he would go further and say that it was one of the least possible utility it might be said that the tax would be inflicted because it was found that outrages had been committed and that great difficulty existed in the districts amongst the people to give evidence and facilities for the purpose of obtaining the conviction of the offenders who had committed such outrages he would ask her majesty government whether they intended to levy this tax from motives of revenge or from a desire to alter the existing state of things if they proposed to do so from a desire to alter this state of things and to change this disposition which he admitted did exist amongst the people in the districts of ireland where agrarian outrages were committed and where there was a desire to shield a criminal from justice if they acted in this way for the purpose of changing the feelings of the people he might take it for the moment that if they were likely to succeed by this course of action then they would be justified in pursuing it but what had been their experience in reference to the infliction of these acts upon the people in districts where crime was committed had it ever brought about a more favourable state of feeling amongst the people had they found that the districts where the criminals were sheltered before had changed their opinion and become desirous of delivering up the criminals had they not rather found that many men who abhorred outrage and murder when they found that those who were innocent were made to suffer for the guilty had become exasperated with the government which was so far unable to govern the country except upon the most rudimentary principles as to confirm them in their desire to shelter the criminals this blood tax for it was nothing else was really one of the relics of barbarism in ireland it had not produced the effect it was intended to produce and it did not make it more easy to discover the criminal on the contrary the feeling produced was only one of exasperation and disaffection against the government in ireland he would ask in view of these circumstances whether her majesty government could not give the committee some assurance that whatever might be the powers they possessed they would be used with the greatest possible discrimination and discretion and that they would largely limit the number of cases in which districts were taxed under the old system for the support of extra police force for his part he would say that if the government showed that they were going to administer those excessive powers which they possessed in ireland but which they had not in england moderately and justly he should he very glad to use any influence he might possess with the people of those districts both publicly and privately to prevent the commission of outrages and murders he had always felt himself that agitation in ireland was a most unpleasant course for them to adopt he had always regretted that circumstances should be such that when their times and seasons of distress occurred they should be accompanied by attempts on the part of ignorant persons to revenge themselves upon those whom they supposed had brought about that distress by inflicting pain upon animals but he considered that the existence of such outrages in ireland had been much exaggerated they must recollect that in ireland in the old times the people had from time to time endeavoured to resist the oppression to which they were subjected by maiming the cattle simply because they had no other way in which they could make their wrongs known but now public meetings and other constitutional means of expressing an opinion were open to them and they had not the same reason for maiming cattle in the manner described or for committing other outrages he believed that during the last century the practice of maiming cattle had enormously diminished the facilities which were now afforded to the people to meet together in public and to express their grievances constitutionally and publicly and the power of combination which had been taught to them had been largely instrumental in reducing the number of outrages both upon cattle and upon individuals for practically speaking there had been but very few outrages upon individuals he had no reason to suppose but that these outrages would still further diminish and would eventually disappear altogether the tenantry of ireland were able to win this battle without inflicting injury upon animals or upon their landlords and he was convinced that they would win in the long run he would further ask the right hon gentleman whether in the event of his finding it unnecessary to call parliament together for the purpose of obtaining further powers for protecting life and property in ireland if that on the other hand the landlords were to any material extent making use of their powers so as to force the government to support them in their acts of injustice he would summon parliament for the purpose of passing a bill which would relieve the government from the necessity of being obliged to support injustice the way in which the right hon gentleman put the matter on tuesday was scarcely fortunate he told them as he had previously done that if he found the ordinary law insufficient to enable the government to protect life and property he would call parliament together to obtain additional power and he added that in the event of his finding that the landlords of ireland were to a great extent compelling the government to assist them in working injustice he would also bring forward a bill for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of such injustice that was to say some kind of land bill he would put it to the right hon gentleman that the effect of that declaration was to tell the irish tenantry that unless they committed outrage and murder and rendered it impossible for him to administer the ordinary law of the land he would not bring in a land bill for their benefit notwithstanding that the government might find that any minority of the landlords of ireland were using their powers unjustly if he put it in this way he would announce to all whom it might concern that whether he was able to govern ireland by the ordinary method of the constitution or not and if he found that the landlords of ireland were to any extent compelling the government during the coming autumn or winter to enforce the law in such a way as to work injustice he would call parliament together for the purpose of passing a land bill he would free himself very much from the imputations cast upon him as he thought very rightly by the hon member for tipperary mr dillon and the other hon members who had spoken from the conservative benches in critizing sic his speech of tuesday last in conclusion he would say that although it would appear that the government intended to carry out the decision of their predecessors with regard to the maintenance of that constabulary force still he must say that he felt as confident as he was of his own existence that if that force were abolished the necessity for the majority of changes in the land laws would disappear some people had said that it was the landlords and the state of the land laws which rendered the constabulary necessary he would rather put it the other way and say that it was the constabulary that made bad landlords in ireland if landlords knew that for the enforcement of their rights they had just as much assistance from public opinion and the forces at the disposal of the crown as they would have in england or scotland under similar circumstances it would be found that that enforcement of rights would be limited in the same way as they were in this country the deplorable necessity that existed of frequently bringing before parliament that question would cease and a mutual arrangement would follow between landlords and tenants with regard to their respective rights in the land the government unfortunately proposed to adopt a different course they proposed to keep that large military force of highly trained men in existence they had adopted or proposed to adopt a new method of armament they intended giving buckshot instead of bullets for short ranges the government had not in any one respect intimated that the force that was maintained for the carrying out of what was acknowledged to be bad law was to be reduced in the slightest degree on the contrary the present large numbers had been increased the force which the right hon gentleman had sent for the purpose of carrying out the evictions was larger than that sent by his predecessor and thereby the right hon gentleman had taken upon himself a grave responsibility if the result was that during this autumn or winter hardships and suffering were being imposed upon the poor tenants the right hon gentleman the chief secretary would have taken upon himself a grave responsibility both as regarded the peace of ireland and the future relations between the two countries he mr parnell could not conceive of anything more calculated to turn the mind of the people away and prevent them from assimilating themselves as was desired to the english system than the harsh enforcement of the english law if the result should be that large numbers of evictions took place and were followed by violent resistance to the police in carrying them out a course which he must confess he thought less criminal and less objectionable than assassination of landlords or houghing of cattle then the right hon gentleman would have a responsibility which he thought no public man would desire to have he had just one more observation to make they had the employment of police at all public meetings he had attended he believed every one that had been held with the exception of those held during the electoral campaign he did not refer to the meetings of the electoral campaign but of those of the land agitation a large force of police numbering from to attended with their rifles bayonets and a plentiful supply of ammunition he would ask what in the name of conscience did that intimate as far as he knew there had not been a single riotous or disorderly proceeding not a single instance in that series of large public meetings at times when the minds of the people were certainly very much agitated and excited and yet whenever he went to a meeting he saw flanking the platform a body of constabulary numbering drawn up in battle array for what purpose were those men stationed there or was there any purpose their services had never been called into request and the only reason that he could suggest was that they were there for the protection of the government shorthand writers and that not from the violence of the people but simply to protect them from disturbance while taking notes he would tell the right hon gentleman that that attendance at those meetings of the police force which was composed of the sons of farmers wasono sic great reason in favour of their becoming demoralized from the point of view of the government but not from his mr parnell's point of view he had often been struck with the intense interest those fine young men took in the speeches which were called revolutionary by some people which had been made at so many of those meetings he could not but think that if the right hon gentleman wished to keep the constabulary force from having any sympathy with the land league it were far better that he should not allow them to attend those meetings considering the fact that there had been no breach of the peace at the public meetings to which he had already referred he was at a loss to understand why the government should insist upon that absurd exhibition of force which had been initiated by the late conservative government he could of course understand that when the present government came into office the right hon gentleman was naturally guided by the officials of dublin castle he felt no doubt that it was not necessary to make a hasty change and being absorbed by his parliamentary duties had not the time to examine the question he mr parnell believed however that when the right hon gentleman went into the question and the statement that he had then made he would find that there was not the slightest reason for the practice to which he had alluded and that in the future the land meetings might be held without the presence of a large force of the constabulary one reason suggested for that force being present was that the government found it necessary to send shorthand writers to take notes of the speeches and that the police protected them in regard to that he would say that the right hon gentleman would find when he inquired into the matter that no real attempt had ever been made to ill treat those shorthand writers he could assure the right hon gentleman that if it were made a point of honour with the promoters of the meetings that if the constabulary were kept away the government shorthand writers should be treated courteously and with proper regard to the usuages sic of war he would find that no sort of rudeness would be offered to any of those men he did not wish to detain the committee at greater length he had endeavoured to put certain practical matters before them which he believed required to be considered before that vote was put from the chair\n",

      "mr parnell said that in view of the action taken in another place in regard to a certain bill he wished to suggest to the government that they might take a course on the appropriation bill which would have the effect of showing what the feelings and sympathies of the government really were in regard to the administration of affairs in ireland and also of showing that the government did not intend to allow the proceedings of that house in regard to ireland to be set at nought and made the subject of ridicule he wished to suggest to the government that they had two courses open to them he thought it would be possible to prove that these courses were open to them by precedents of long standing the government could agree to tack the 8th clause of the bill in question on to the appropriation bill and limit the operation of that clause to two years or they could introduce a new bill consisting of the 8th clause for a similar period of duration there were several direct precedents as to the first course as was evidenced by a re solution of the house of lords passed on the 9th december and referred to by sir erskine may in his work on that date it was ordered and declared by the lords that the annexation of any clause to a bill of aid or supply was unparliamentary and tended to the destruction of the constitution there was a resolution passed by the lords in reference to special acts from the commons in the paragraph he had described and referring to the precedents which he desired the government to consider he found also that in a conference took place between the two houses in reference to the clause introduced by the commons in a money bill creating an incapacity in the commissioners or assessors of the excise to sit in parliament against this action the lords protested but at the conference which was held they gave way and they passed the bill with these clauses in it on that occasion the commons successfully vindicated their right to attach to a money bill a matter which was foreign to the subject matter of the bill in question now with reference to the second course it was open to the government to introduce a new bill consisting of the 8th clause and limiting the duration of the bill say to two years he found that he had a precedent upon that in when mr canning re introduced a bill with reference to the duties on foreign corn which had been seriously modified by the lords he re introduced it and limited its duration for two years and it was passed by the commons and subsequently passed by the lords there was a further course for a precedent of of sic a different kind in a bill consisting of two clauses came to the committee stage and was saved from the interference of the lords by an instruction being given to the committee to deal with the clauses on the appropriation bill being considered so that the appropriation bill was tacked to the other bill the two courses which he recommended to her majesty government were the two which he had mentioned namely that they should either tack the 8th clause to the bill or they should introduce a fresh bill and move to suspend the standing orders in order to carry it at one sitting but if consent were given that was not necessary he thought they were fairly entitled to ask the government to show their bona fides he wished to point out what had been the course of attempted legislation with regard to ireland that every bill sent up from the house of commons making any real change in the law had been ignominiously rejected by the house of lords upon the second reading that happened with regard to the limitation of costs bill introduced by the hon member for longford mr errington mr parnell said he had referred to the bill introduced by the hon member for longford because he had been informed that on several occasions opportunities had been taken on the stages of the appropriation bill to call the attention of the house to the course of legislation during the session and consequently he supposed himself in order in referring to that measure however it was not absolutely necessary for him in order to argue his point to refer to matters patent and in the mind of hon members and which constituted a ground for the application he made to the government and to the house namely that the government should mark their sense of passing events and of the determination in the future to carry out the authority of the house of commons by that legitimate action which he had pointed out based upon precedents of unimpeachable authority and securing that the registration of voters ireland bill might come before her majesty for her good will and pleasure\n",

      "mr president ladies and gentlemen it gives me the greatest possible pleasure to see this magnificent meeting and of course i recognize to the fullest possible extent that you have not assembled here to night to do me honor but that you have come rather as a token of your appreciation of the cause which i represent in america applause and to show your sympathy your practical sympathy for the struggling oppressed and suffering people of ireland applause our people at home are passing through a crisis which has not been equaled sic in severity for thirty years a great famine is upon us and already had it not been for the help which you have been sending over in such a bountiful amount many of my poor countrymen and country women would have been under the sod ere now but thanks to your generous assistance there has not been much loss of life from famine up to now and although there has been a great deal of bitter and severe suffering although many thousands of our people are daily becoming enfeebled through simple starvation yet i am happy to think that your help has saved the lives of many hundreds of persons and your sympathy and the force of public opinion of this country have been of even more service than the money which you have sent so plentifully to ireland applause and a voice shove the herald down for it has compelled the british government to at all events pretend to do its duty in coming to the aid of the famished in ireland and don't let my object be misunderstood if you please the government of england has as yet done nothing but it is beginning to recognise that the public opinion of america and of the world will not permit the irish people to be starved to death as they were starved to death in when we came here when we landed in this country six weeks ago we pointed out that even the magnificent charity of a nation such as this could not prevail to prevent a famine in ireland that at the best you could only stave it off for a while until your public opinion had compelled the government of england to move and as i have just said that government is now commencing to feel the force of this public opinion and while you have generously helped us while as i have just said you have saved hundreds and thousands of our people from death during the past month you have also done a far greater service by setting the only power which can effectually stay the terrible famine which is now upon us and we think that as the government of england while it does nothing itself has sanctioned the semi official appeal on the part of the lord lieutenant of ireland to america for assistance that you have acquired on your part a right to inquire into the causes of this irish famine applause and to express your opinion as the opinion of a free nation as to the remedy which should be applied to remove those causes applause we do not desire to embroil your government with that of england by no means but we think that a people like the american people is entitled to it if it wishes to express its opinion upon this question and more especially when you have been appealed to in the way you have been from england for help for ireland and since you have answered that appeal in the magnificent way in which you have and now let us consider what the causes of the irish famine and distress are and recollect that there is plenty of food in ireland there has always been plenty of food in ireland during these famines our irish famines of food are famines of the means with which to buy food the peasantry in their attempts to pay impossible rents have spent all their money that money has gone to the absentee landlords left the country they now find themselves those of them who have not taken our advice to pay only a fair rent in this season of scarcity they now find themselves without one single penny with which to satisfy the cravings of their starving wives and children and hence this is an artificial famine it is a famine produced and deliberately produced by bad law and by government neglect of the interests of ireland what is the situation there i find that there are in ireland a little over twenty million acres of land and about two hundred and ninety two persons owning one third of this land just reflect for a moment upon these figures one third of all the land in ireland is owned by about as many people as are sitting in that gallery opposite well then if you take both of these galleries put together you will have perhaps four or five hundred people and four or five hundred people more own about the one fifth part of the rest of the land in that country and altogether about ten thousand persons or about as many as could comfortably sit down inside this hall own all the lands of ireland few if any of them have ever been in that country or ever intended to go there the money that they receive in the shape of rent is taken away and spent in london in paris in berlin in ever place except ireland and it is as hopelessly lost to that country as if it were thrown into the sea applause and now about the tenant farmers there are six hundred thousand tenant farmers standing face to face with these ten thousand land owners and accusing these men of having cause the famine which is now destroying themselves and their little ones that is the situation in ireland and these six hundred thousand tenant farmers do not give up the irish land system which has produced these results they will give the land owners up applause and the way they propose to give them up is by stopping their supplies or at all events some of the very bountiful supplies they have been receiving up to the present moment we recommended the tenantry of ireland about six months ago i wish we had commenced giving this advice twelve months ago for if we had there would have been no famine in ireland we recommended the tenantry to pay only a fair rent to their landlords and those who have taken our advice are not to day suffering from famine those who on the other hand through fear or for some other reason refused to take our advice are starving but all the tenantry see that their only safety against these constantly recurring famines is to demand the abolition of the feudal system of land tenure and pending this abolition to pay only a fair rent to the landlords applause the condition of ireland at all times is one of constant and chronic poverty even in the best of seasons the people are not very far removed from starvation hence it only requires a partial failure of the crops to cause a famine now many people suppose that ireland is a poor country but ireland is not naturally poor the lands of ireland are exceedingly rich unequaled sic in richness by any lands i have seen in this country the blue grass regions of kentucky can not touch in point of fertility the rich grazing pastures of the great central plains of ireland applause it is true you don't have famines in the blue grass region of kentucky while we have famines on the rich plains in ireland the reason is that your farmers in kentucky are allowed to own the land and live on it while our farmers in ireland are driven off of these fertile lands and compelled to herd on the barren and rocky hillside places which have not as yet tempted the cupidity of the landlords and the families we hear of are families where the people are crowded together if they were allowed to live on the lands and to cultivate them there would be thirty acres of land for each of those tenant farmers and i believe that thirty acres of good land in ireland are far better than one hundred and fifty acres of wild land out in these western regions mr parnell then referred to the claim that ireland was overcrowded and showed that with salutary land laws it was capable of supporting the speaker then referred to an article by mr james anthony froude in the north american review of january bearing on the subject of the land tenure in ireland he claimed that if he went as far as mr froude he would have to claim that the lands of ireland would have to be forfeited to the people to mr froude assertion that england had done what she could for ireland had subscribed money the speaker retorted that it was a lie that england always left subscriptions to ireland to be made by other countries mr parnell next spoke of the relief that had been extended toward the suffering in ireland while it might be invidious to carp or find fault with any committee which was engaged in the work still he felt it was his duty to put americans in possession of information in reference to some of the channels which were offering to distribute the relief furnished he explained that there were four separate bodies there was the relief committee of the irish national land league of which he was the president it was the first to appeal to america for help and to distribute it on christmas eve next came the appeal of the duchess of marlborough this appeal was dictated by the political exigencies of her husband he being the lord lieutenant of ireland no steps had been taken up to the present moment by the government of which he was the responsible head to relieve the distress in ireland saving to send troops into connemara to steal from the poor people the little food they have remaining in partial satisfaction of the exorbitant claims of the landlords for rent and the hounding on of these troops to bayonet the unfortunate women and children of connemara information has been furnished of the direct misappropriation of the funds intrusted to the duchess of marlborough next came the dublin mansion house relief committee it was packed with the landlords and it was possible that its composition prevented it from receiving the confidence of the american people as a channel for relief several of its members have had their hands reeking with the blood of those poor women in connemara who were bayoneted to death the other day others had been guilty of frightful eviction atrocities pulling the roofs from over poor people burning the corn for which they could find no buyers sooner than allow the people to eat it i now come continued the speaker to the special relief fund which has been established by the new york herald hisses and in dealing with this question you must not forget that the new york herald for several months has been noted for its advocacy of the landlords side of the question it has thrown its powerful shield over the irish landlord and it is not the fault of the new york herald if we have been able to penetrate that shield and i wished to give the new york herald a fair trial and when this fund was formed i called upon the herald to name its committee and i pledged myself that if it appointed it mainly composed of men possessing the confidence of the irish people i would support it in its appeal to america and do the best i could to assist it while the new york herald came out with a show of fairness and it published the names of the gentlemen whom it wished to take office on its committee one of these persons was myself and if some persons in whom i have confidence could have acted upon this committee i believe that the landlord and government element in it might have been compelled to do what was right and although i was exceedingly unwilling to have any thing to do with such a journal as the new york herald or touch pitch lest i might be defied yet yielding to the anxious request of my friends i so far consented as to say that if the new york herald would allow me a proxy to act for me in ireland pending my return there i would serve on the committee the new york herald gives its answer to day and in giving that answer it shows what its character for appealing for aid is that is neither more nor less than a masked attack upon the tenantry of ireland and that the name of charity is being prostituted for the purpose of assisting the infamous and oppressive landlords system applause i have a telegram which has just arrived from new york it says the herald can not accept my proposition to appoint a proxy while i am in america it says it gives the cardinal the privilege of naming proxies but does not concede that to parnell not recognize parnell rights to prescribe duties the cardinal duties would not allow him to go to ireland to distribute relief why it says should not parnell go at once and leave off preaching treason against the government of his country applause it would have desired to have me work on its committee yes work in america where my vote and voice and influence would have been of no use as regards the practical work of its committee and it dismisses me from its thoughts well if the new york herald dismisses me from its thoughts i can assure it that i do not intend to dismiss it applause and laughter that i shall keep pretty close upon it and its committee whether i am in america or ireland renewed applause i am sorry that this should have happened it would have pleased me very much better if the different committees could have worked in harmony but knowing as i do the position of things in ireland knowing what a deadly blow would be struck against the irish tenant farmer if he is compelled to apply to the landowners for his daily dread sic i have felt myself unable to take any other position in this contest than the one explained that position shall continue to hold if i have not the men to stand by me mr parnell concluded by returning his thanks for the grateful sympathy of his bearers and their practical aid when engaged in a great work the work he said is going to succeed but the famine in addition to the power and might of the law and of the british government presents great odds but with your help in keeping our people during the winter i feel that we shall kill the irish landlord system and that when we have given the land of ireland to the people of ireland we shall have laid the foundation upon which to build up our irish nation loud applause the feudal land of tenure and the rule of the minority have been the cornerstone of english misrule and when that is broken up we shall have paved the way for ireland to take her proper place among the nations of the world applause let us not forget that this is our ultimate goal and while i would not permit an unequal struggle with the armed power of a government yet it is the duty of us all to do every thing we can to prepare the way to ireland return to freedom applause help us to kill this famine and i promise you that it will be the last famine and that the day will not be far distant when irish men and women may look with pride upon the part which you have taken in bringing about that great work and you will be able to say that you have a country at home which is no longer enslaved but a country in every way worthy of the brilliant history of our people and the magnificent struggles that they have made renewed applause\n",

      "it gives me the greatest possible pleasure to meet this great audience who have come not to see me but out of appreciation to the cause i represent and to show their sympathy for the suffering people of ireland our people are passing through a crisis such as we have not met for thirty years but thanks to your kindness not so many are under the sod as might have been your sympathies and you public opinion have even been of more service than the mere of feeding or our starving people sic for you have thus compelled the english government to pretend at least to do its duty in coming to the aid of the famished in ireland when we came here and landed in this country six weeks ago we pointed out that your liberality could only stave off starvation awhile till the government of england began to move while you have saved thousands you have done more by setting in motion the only power that can assist us in this work of restoring ireland to permanent peace and prosperity you have a right to inquire into the cause of this famine and to investigate what methods are used to rescue the irish people we do not wish to embroil your country in a war with any foreign power but your people have a right to know what the real miseries of the irish people are there is not a famine of food there is a famine of the means to buy food the oppressive rents have exhausted the resources of the peasantry the renters who neglected our advice to withhold the money claimed by landlords are bereft of their means and can not now pay for food for their wives and children the country of ireland contains in all about acres ten thousand persons own the whole of this vast tract of the ninety two people who own one third of this land the greater number live out of the country and they never intend to go to the island the money they take from ireland is as hopelessly lost as if it were thrown into the sea on the other hand there are tenant farmers accusing the landlords of causing the present trouble they say if the landlords do not give up the present system they will give up the landlords such in brief is the controversy which must be settled before ireland can have peace we recommended to these people six months ago to retain their rents and we ought to have recommended it twelve months ago for them we might have prevented this famine we see plainly enough that there is no remedy except to abandon the system of feudal land tenure and in the meanwhile charge only reasonable rent to the actual occupants of the land the country of ireland is not really poor it will compare favorably with the best and most fertile parts of this country i have just visited the noble blue grass region of kentucky but fine as it is it does not compare with the great central plains of ireland they do not have famines in the blue grass region we do because the farmers of ireland are forced to herd on the barren lands while the farmers of the great central plain of kentucky own the land they till i believe thirty acres in ireland would be better under the system of small freeholders than in these western regions we are told that ireland is overcrowded and that emigration is the remedy proper to be applied but the population of ireland is only now we never hear of holland and belgium being overcrowded yet they are vastly more populous than ireland but in those countries the land is owned by the people the little island of guernsey contains persons to acres ireland equally crowded could contain of people yet guernsey is one of the richest little islands in the world but in guernsey every man owns his own land no landlords there therefore no famines there great applause but i do not wish you to take my word for it take froude an unprejudiced witness an historian of acknowledged ability and sincerity now froude says that the greatest mistake the english made in the management of the affairs in ireland was the introduction of the english system of land tenure a system totally at variance with the sentiment of the people you know as well as i that the irish landlords obtained their title by confiscation and those titles secured by confiscation sometimes succeeded each other three or four times in the case of the same tract of land we do not desire to repeat this miserable experience of the past what we want is that the landlords shall receive a reasonable sum in payment for the land which they shall be obliged to quit for my part i do not care to have this matter settled to day the longer delay there is about it the easier will be the victory of the tenants it will be to the interest of the latter to wait but the landlords would have found the tenants easier to deal with last year than this and they would have a pleasanter settlement this year than next if it were my place to give the landlords advice i should say to them you are but a few and arrayed against you are hundreds of thousands smarting under the wrongs which you have inflicted history shows that in such contests the tyrannical and oppressive minorities are invariably forced to the wall such must be your fate if the people do not receive justice again it is said that the miseries of ireland are due to the idleness of her people and to the religion which they profess but here i refer you a second time to the testimony of froude who has shown in the article from the north american review already quoted that the irish who have emigrated to other lands though they have retained their religion are neither idle nor thriftless there are other lands where the people are catholics but those people are not lazy nor improvident neither are the irish people idle except as the land system under which they live reduces them to penury and to shiftlessness and starvation turning from this subject to the question how these miseries are to be relieved i am obliged to touch upon some matters very disagreeable to me it is not a pleasant thing to carp or find fault with a committee of relief especially in a country to which i have come to solicit aid for the famine stricken poor of ireland but we have felt it necessary that something must be said on this point not only to defend ourselves from the charges that are made against us but to show the purpose of the various plans of relief that have been put in use at the present time there are four separate bodies appealing to the united states for help the one which i shall mention first is the irish national land league and this is the organization which i represent it was the first to call on americans for assistance and the first in the endeavour to force upon the attention of the english government the real state of affairs in ireland this organization seeks for the people not only relief from the immediate prospect of starvation but the permanent rescue of the country from the system of land tenure which is the cause of all the evils which it suffers the second appeal was made by the duchess of marlborough i do not like to say anything against a woman especially against a woman who professes to make charity her aim but in this instance it must be remembered that the woman of whom i speak is interested only for her husband government the duke of marlborough is the lord lieutenant of ireland no steps have been taken by his government looking to the true benefit of the country on the other hand the lord lieutenant has not been slow to send troops into conemara sic to take the food from starving peasants and thus to obtain partial satisfaction for the rent withheld from the landlords the poor tenants ejected by the soldiery from their huts have been left to die in the snow with such facts before us we must suspect a plan of relief suggested by the wife of one under whose orders these brutalities are committed moreover proof has been sent us that these funds are misappropriated by being use sic for political purposes the third request for relief comes from the dublin mansion house i should like to speak kindly of this enterprise i am sorry the lord mayor of dublin a personal friend of mine has chosen to give it his countenance and assistance for the men who are prominent in it come forward with their hands red from the worst brutalities that have attended any of the evictions they have caused the corn to be burned in the field because they could not get it harvested and were unable to sell it in order that they might prevent the peasantry from living upon it nobody could have objected to these men putting their hands into their own pockets what i object against them is their attempt to put their hands into your pockets the fourth plan of relief is that of subscriptions taken by the new york herald the mention of the herald elicited a perfect storm of hisses which interrupted the speaker for an appreciable space of time that the feeling exhibited was so general demonstrated what one might have merely conjectured before that the assemblage was almost entirely composed of irish people continuing mr parnell said the course of the herald since the beginning of the present troubles in ireland showed that it was in covert sympathy with the iniquitous landlord system but i wished to treat its proposition fairly and i requested the paper to publish the names of responsible gentlemen who should constitute a committee to oversee the disbursement of the herald subscription it came out with apparent honesty and gave the names of five gentlemen of whom i was to be one if it had been possible for me to be in ireland and yet accomplish the work in this country which i came to perform but i could not leave the united states therefore i asked them to allow me to name a proxy to act in my place on that committee until i returned to ireland the answer to my request was published in the herald to day as i find by the telegram which i hold in my hand the herald concedes to the cardinal the right to appoint a proxy for the reason that he can not go to ireland but not to parnell who right to dictate in this matter is unworthy of consideration there is not says the herald to prevent parnell going back to ireland instead of proclaiming treason against the government to which he owes allegiance it proceeds to say that it will dismiss parnell from consideration hereafter well it can do that perhaps but i shall not dismiss the herald from my thoughts i have been a worker all my life and i can not consent to go at this time where i should be forced to be idle knowing the position of the irish farmer as i do know it knowing his danger under the present system i could not do otherwise than i am doing even if i did not receive the support of a single man we have a great work before us but with your assistance we can pass the winter in ireland and can kill the irish land system and when that corner stone of english misgovernment has been ground to powder the way is paved for ireland to take her proper place among the nations of the world help us to prevent the famine and we promise you it will be the last famine\n",

      "mr president renewed applause and ladies and gentlemen it gives me the greatest possible pleasure to see this magnificent meeting and of course i recognize to the fullest extent that you have not assembled here to night to do me honor but you have come rather as a token of that appreciation for the cause which i represent in america applause and to show your practical sympathy for the struggling oppressed and suffering people of ireland applause our people at home are passing through a crisis which has not been equaled sic in severity for thirty years a great famine is upon us and had it not been for the help which you have been sending over in such bountiful amount many of my poor countrymen and countrywomen would have been under the sod but thanks to your generous assistance there has not been much loss of life from famine up to now and although there has been a great deal of bitter and severe suffering and although many of our people are daily becoming enfeebled through slow starvation yet i am happy to think that your help is saving the lives of many hundreds yes thousands of persons and your sympathy and the force of public opinion of this country has been of even more service than the money which you have sent so plentifully to ireland loud applause voice in the gallery shut the herald down shut the herald down it has compelled the british government at all events to pretend to do its duty in coming to the aid of the famished in ireland don't let me be misunderstood if you please the government of england has as yet done nothing but it is beginning to recognize that the public opinion of america and the world will not permit the irish people to be starved to death as they were starved applause when we landed in this country six weeks ago we pointed out that even the magnificent charity of the nation such as yours could not always prevent famine in ireland that at the best could only stave it off for a while until your public opinion had compelled the government of england to move and as i have just said that government is now showing us that it is commencing to feel the force of this public opinion and more you have generously helped us and have saved hundred and perhaps thousands of people from death during the last month you have also done us far greater service by setting in motion the only power which can effectually stay the terrible famine which is now upon us and we think that as the government of england while it does nothing itself as there is a semi official appeal on the part of the tenantry of ireland to america for assistance you have acquired on your part a right to inquire into the causes of this irish famine and to express your opinion as the opinion of a free nation as to the remedy that should be applied to remove these causes applause we do not desire to embroil your government with that of england by any means but we think that a people like the american people is entitled if it wishes to assert its influence upon this question and more especially when you have been appealed to in the way you have been for help for ireland and since you have answered that appeal in the magnificent way you have now let us consider the causes of the irish famine and distress there and recollect that there is plenty of food in ireland there is always plenty of food in ireland during these famines our irish famines are not famines of food they are famines of means with which to buy food the peasantry in their attempts to pay impossible rents have spent all their money already that money has gone to the absentee landlords and left the country they now find themselves those of them who have not taken our advice to pay only a fair rent in this season of scarcity they now find themselves without one single penny with which to satisfy the cravings of their starving wives and children hence this artificial famine produced deliberately produced by bad laws by governmental neglect of the interests of ireland what is the situation there i find that there are in ireland a little over twenty million acres of land and about persons owning one third of all this land just reflect for a moment upon these figures one third of all the land in ireland is owned by about as many people as are now sitting in that gallery opposite to me well then if you take both of these galleries together you will have perhaps four or five hundred people and that number own about one fifth of the rest of the land in that country and altogether about persons or as many as could comfortably sit inside of this hall own all the lands of ireland now of these people who own one third of the land nearly all live out of ireland few if any of them ever have been in that country or ever intend to go there the money that they receive in the shape of rents is taken away and spent in london in berlin and in paris in every place excepting ireland and it is as hopelessly lost to that country as if it were thrown into the sea applause and how about the tenant farmers there are six million tenant farmers standing face to face with these ten thousand landlords and these six million tenant farmers say to day that if the irish landlords don't give up the irish land system which has produced these results that they will give the landlords up applause and the way that they propose to give them up is by stopping their supplies or at all events some of the very bountiful supplies they have been receiving up to the present moment we recommended the tenantry of ireland about six months ago i wish we had commenced to give this advice twelve months ago if we had there would be no famine to day in ireland we recommended the tenantry to pay only a fair rent to their landlords and those who have taken our advice are not to day suffering from famine those on the other hand who through fear or for some other reason refused to take our advice are starving but the tenantry of ireland see that their only safety against these constantly recurring famines is to demand the abolition of the feudal system of land tenure and pending its abolition only to pay a fair rent to the landlord applause the condition of ireland at all times is one of constant poverty in the best of seasons the people are not very far removed from starvation hence it only requires a partial failure of the crops to cause a famine now many people suppose that ireland is a poor country but ireland is not naturally poor the lands of ireland are exceedingly rich unequaled sic in richness by any lands i have seen in this country a few days back i visited the blue grass regions of kentucky which is held up to us as one of the most remarkable examples of american fertility but the blue grass regions of kentucky in point of fertility can not reach the grazing pastures of the great central plains of ireland applause it is true you do not have famines in the blue grass regions of kentucky while we have famines in our rich plains of ireland but the reason is that your farmers in kentucky are allowed to own land and to live on it furthermore farmers in ireland are driven off of these fertile lands and compelled to subsist on the barren and rocky hill sides places which have not as yet tempted the cupidity of the landlord if the people were to live on these rich lands and to cultivate them there would be thirty acres of good land for each of these tenant farmers in ireland and i believe thirty acres of good land in ireland are far better than acres of the wild land in this western region applause then we are told that ireland is very crowded and that the remedy for irish distress is emigration well now the population of ireland is about that gives inhabitants to the square mile the number of inhabitants in belgium and holland to the square mile is just more than double that in ireland and yet i never hear that belgium and holland are very crowded and that they require the constant blood letting of emigration to keep them healthy but they have no landlords in belgium and holland the land of that country belongs to the people of that country applause but the island of guernsey presents a still more remarkable incidence the island of guernsey shows inhabitants to an area of acres ireland if as densely peopled as guernsey would support in comfort a population of instead of only five and a half million applause and guernsey with its large and crowded population is one of the richest little islands in the world its soil and climate are not superior to that of ireland she is not near the great markets but in guernsey every man owns his own land and the law facilitates the obtaining of land by every poor man upon easy terms there are no landlords there and there are no famines in guernsey applause but i don't wish you to take my word only as to the cause or causes of these irish famines i will give you the testimony of a man who can not be accused of being prejudiced in favor of ireland i refer to james anthony froude the english historian but of all the fatal gifts which we bestowed on our unhappy possession was the english system of owning land land properly speaking can not be owned by any man it belongs to all the human race laws have been made to secure the profits of their industry to those who cultivate it but the private property of this or that person which is entitled to deal with as he pleases land never ought to be and never strictly is in ireland as in all primitive civilizations the soil was divided among the tribes each tribe collectively owned its own district under the feudal system the proprietor was the crown as representing the nation while the subordinate tenures were held with duties attached to them and were liable on non fulfilment to forfeiture mr froude tells us that landlords who have not fulfilled the duties of landlords deserve to have their lands forfeited if we were to go as far as he goes with the claim that the lands of ireland ought to be forfeited to the people this would be nothing more than restitution because you must recollect the irish landlords obtained their original title all by confiscation applause and that much of the land there has been confiscated three times over but we don't go as far as that we say we are willing to give landlords very much better compensation for their interest than they deserve i do not very much care about settling this question to day i think the irish can afford to wait and the longer they wait the better will be the settlement that will be obtained but if i were interested in behalf of irish landlords i would recommend them to settle as quickly as they possibly can loud applause they could have obtained very much better terms from the tenants last year than they are likely to obtain to day and they can obtain to day very much better terms than they are likely to get in a year time applause and if it were my business to give advice to the landlords of ireland these men who are face to face with i should say to them remember that in the long run the minority which attempts unjustly to tyrannize the majority always goes to the walls loud and prolonged applause but i wish to give one more quotation from mr froude we are told that it is the idleness and the religion of the irish people which make them poor in ireland it is a strange thing that they bring their religion to other countries applause and it is also a remarkable fact that these are catholic nations enjoying a good system of land tenure applause but mr froude admits my case in a still more remarkable manner he says if we had been more faithful in our stewardship ireland would have been as wealthy and prosperous as the sister island and not at the mercy of a potato blight we did what we could we subscribed money that is a lie anyhow laughter and applause the english always left the subscriptions for the irish to be made by other nations just as they do to day applause we laid a poor law on the land but it was to no purpose the emigrants went away with rage in their hearts and a longing hope of revenge hereafter with america help i will pass from the consideration of the causes that have produced this irish famine to another question the practical extent of relief for the starving and in the way which that relief is to be distributed now this is to me a very disagreeable subject it seems invidious to say the least of it to find fault with any committee or body which may act or is formed for the purpose of alleviating the distress in ireland that may seem practically so to the people of this country who do not understand the situation which exists at present there but we have felt it our duty to americans to enlighten them in reference to some of the channels which are presenting themselves for distributing the relief which you are sending over although this is a disagreeable task to me i could not with the commonest and most ordinary regard for my duty have refrained from undertaking it there are four separate bodies appealing for aid to america at the present moment there is the relief committee of the irish national land league of which i have the honor to be the president and which i represent in this country applause that body was the first to appeal to america for help just as it was the first to predict that there must be a famine and to call upon the government of england for assistance and to force upon the attention of this government the fact that a famine was upon us and i am glad to say that the relief committee of the irish national land league was the first body to receive help from america and to distribute it on christmas eve amongst the starving peasantry in twenty five districts in the west of ireland applause next came the appeal of the duchess of marlborough and although i do not like to say anything against a woman especially a woman who represents herself as relieving the distress of her fellow women in ireland yet as undoubtedly this appeal of the duchess of marlborough was dictated by the political exigencies of her husband government et c the money that she gets will undoubtedly be used for political purposes it is necessary for me however disagreeable it may be to tell the truth in reference even to this lady applause for we can not in this matter separate husband from wife and it must be borne in mind that that the duke of marlborough lord lieutenant of ireland is the husband of the lady and up to the present moment no steps have been taken by the government of which he is the responsible head to relieve the distress in ireland save the sending of troops into connemara to steal from the poor people the little food they had remaining in satisfaction or in partial satisfaction of the claims of the landlords for rent and the hounding on of the troops to bayonet the unfortunate men women and children of connemara hence we find the real head of this relief committee actively engaged in driving these poor people from their homes into the snow to perish of cold and hunger these poor people whom he pretends to relieve and asks you for your money to assist him in doing it such a pretense such a monstrous fraud and hypocrisy would be possible in no place but in ireland applause information has also reached us from many reliable sources both lay and clerical of the direct misappropriation of the funds intrusted to the duchess of marlborough for distribution complaints are numerous that the charity sent from america is being used as a political engine to assist the landlords in their nefarious work next comes the dublin mansion house relief committee and irish i could say a good word for that body several members of that committee have appealed to you for help their hands reeking at the present moment with the blood of these poor women in conamara who were bayoneted to death i now come to the subject of the relief fund which has been established by the new york herald hisses and groans and in dealing with the question you must not forget that the new york herald for several months has been noted for its advocacy of the landlord side i wished to give the herald a fair trial and when this fund was formed i called upon the herald to name its committee and i pledged myself that if it appointed a committee mainly composed of men possessing the confidence and respect of the irish people i would support it in its appeal to america well the herald came out with a show of fairness it published the names of five gentlemen it wished to serve on the committee one of these was myself and if i or some person in whom i have confidence could have acted on the committee i believe that the landlord and the government element in it might have been compelled to do what was right and although i was exceedingly unwilling to have anything to do with such a journal as the new york herald or to touch pitch lest i might be deflied sic yet yielding to the anxious requests of my friends from all parts of the union i so far consented as to say that if the herald would allow me a proxy to act for me in ireland pending my return there i would serve on the committee and act with the gentlemen named by it and the herald gives its answer to day and in it it shows you what the character of its appeal for aid for the irish people really is it shows that that appeal is neither more or less than a masked attack upon the tenantry of ireland that the name of charity is being prostituted for the purpose of assisting the infamous landlord system i have a telegram just received from new york it says it can not accept my proposition in america it says it gives the cardinal the privilege of naming a proxy but it does not concede that to parnell nor recognize parnell right to prescribe conditions the cardinal duties will not allow him to go to ireland to distribute relief why should not parnell go at once and leave off preaching treason against the government of his country laughter it would have desired me to work on its committee yes work in america where my vote and work and influence would have been of no use as regards practical work on its committee and it dismisses me from its thought i can assure it that i do not dismiss it from my thought applause that i shall keep a pretty close eye upon it and its doings and its committee it only wishes to have my name in order that it may impose it that way upon my countrymen in america i stipulated that if i went on the committee my work was to be done in ireland by somebody who possesses the confidence of the people of ireland applause and that my service should not be a nominal one i have been accustomed to be a worker all my life and i will never consent to give my name to any works in which i can not work with all my heart and with all my might and with all my strength great applause i have felt myself unable to take up any other position with reference to these committees than the one which i have explained to you to night that position i shall continue to hold if i have not a man to stand by me conclusion we are engaged in a great work in ireland and that work is going to succeed six hundred thousand tenant farmers are going to win in this country applause with your help in keeping our people alive this winter i feel confident we shall kill the irish landlord system applause and when we have given ireland to the people of ireland we shall have laid the foundation upon which to build up our irish nation loud applause the feudal tenure and the rule of the minority have been the corner stone of english misrule pull out that corner stone break it up destroy it and you undermine english misgovernment when we have undermined english misgovernment we have paved the way for ireland to take her place among the nations of the earth applause and let us not forget that is the ultimate goal at which all we irishmen aim none of us whether we are in america or in ireland or wherever we may be will be satisfied until we have destroyed the last link which keeps ireland bound to england applause it is the duty of us all to do everything we can by whatever means may be most available and suitable for the time being to prepare the way for ireland return to prosperity help us then to kill this famine we promise you that it shall be the last famine and that the day will not be far distant when the irish men and irish women of america may look with pride upon the part they have taken in bringing about this great work and may be able to say that you have a country a home a free country which is no longer enslaved a country in every way worthy of the brilliant history of our people\n",

they now find themselves those of them who have not taken our advice to pay only a fair rent in this season of scarcity they now find themselves without one single penny with which to satisfy the cravings of their starving wives and children and hence this is an artificial famine it is a famine produced and deliberately produced by bad law and by government neglect of the interests of ireland what is the situation there i find that there are in ireland a little over twenty million acres of land and about two hundred and ninety two persons owning one third of this land just reflect for a moment upon these figures one third of all the land in ireland is owned by about as many people as are sitting in that gallery opposite well then if you take both of these galleries put together you will have perhaps four or five hundred people and four or five hundred people more own about the one fifth part of the rest of the land in that country and altogether about ten thousand persons or about as many as could comfortably sit down inside this hall own all the lands of ireland few if any of them have ever been in that country or ever intended to go there the money that they receive in the shape of rent is taken away and spent in london in paris in berlin in every place except ireland and it is as hopelessly lost to that country as if it were thrown into the sea applause the condition of the irish people can only be bettered by abolishing this system which will carry away with it periodical famines this the people known and hence the agitation now many people suppose that ireland is a poor country but ireland is not naturally poor the lands of ireland are exceedingly rich unequaled in richness by any lands i have seen in this country a few days back i visited the blue grass region of kentucky which is held up to us as one of the more remarkable examples of american fertility but the blue grass regions of kentucky in point of fertility can not reach the grazing pasture of the great central plains of ireland applause it is true you do not have famines in the blue grass regions of kentucky while we have famines in our rich plains of ireland but the reason is that your farmers in kentucky are allowed to own land and to live on it while the farmers in ireland are driven off these fertile lands and compelled to subsist on the barren and rocky hill sides which have not as yet tempted the stupidity of the landlords if the people were to live on the rich lands and to cultivate them there would be thirty acres of good land for each of the tenant farmers in ireland and i believe thirty acres of good land in ireland are far better than acres of the wild land in this western region applause mr parnell then referred to mr froude testimony as to the english land system in ireland and private ownership of land after which he paid his respects to the new york herald italics lashing the herald i now come continued the speaker to the special relief fund which has been established by the new york herald italics hisses and groans and in dealing with this question you must not forget that the new york herald for several months has been noted for its advocacy of the landlords side of the question hisses it has thrown its shield over the irish landlord and it is not the fault of the new york herald italics if we have been able to penetrate that shield i wished to give the new york herald a fair trial and when this fund was formed i called upon the herald italics to name its committee and i pledged myself that if it appointed it mostly composed of men possessing the confidence of the irish people i could support it in its appeal to america the herald italics came out with a show of fairness and it published the names of the gentlemen whom it wished to take office on its committee one of these was myself and if some person in whom i have confidence could have acted upon this committee i believe that the landlord and government element in it might have been compelled to do what was right and although i was exceedingly unwilling to have anything to do with such a journal as the new york herald italics or touch pitch lest i might be defiled yet yielding to the anxious request of my friends i so far consented as to say that if the new york herald italics would allow me a proxy to act for me in ireland pending my return there i would serve on the committee the new york herald italics gives its answer to day and in giving that answer it shows the real character of its appeal for aid that is neither more indecipherable line and that the indecipherable of charity is being prostituted for the purpose of indecipherable the infamous landlord system italics continued applause i have a telegram just arrived from new york it says cannot accept my proposition to appoint a proxy while i am in america it gives the cardinal the privilege of naming proxies but does not concede that to parnell nor recognize parnell rights to prescribe conditions the cardinal duties would not allow him to go to ireland to distribute relief why should not parnell go at once and leave off preaching treason against the government of his country loud laughter and applause it would have desired to have me work on its committee yes work in america where my vote and voice and influence would have been of no use as regards the practical work of its committee and it dismisses me from its thoughts well if the new york herald dismisses me from its thoughts i can assure it that i do not intend to dismiss it applause and laughter that i shall keep pretty close upon its doings and its committee whether i am in america or ireland renewed applause the herald rascally dodge one thing the new york herald clearly shows is that it does not desire me on its committee it only wishes to have my name in order that it may impose in that way upon my countrymen in america i stipulated that if i went upon the committee my work was to be done in ireland by somebody who possesses the confidence of the people of ireland applause and that my service should not be a nominal one i have been accustomed to be a worker all my life and i will never consent to give my name to any works in which i cannot work with all my heart and with all my might and with all my strength great applause i am very sorry that this should have happened it would have pleased me very much better if the different committees could have worked in harmony but knowing as i do the position of things in ireland knowing what a deadly blow would be struck against the irish tenant farmer if he is compelled to apply to the landowners for his daily bread i have felt myself unable to take any other position in this context contest than the one explained that position i shall continue to hold if i have not another man to stand by me loud cheering we are engaged in a great work in ireland and that work is going to succeed justice and the many against injustice and the few must win applause with your help in keeping our people alive this winter i feel confident we shall kill the irish landlord system applause and when we have give ireland to the people of ireland we shall have laid the foundation upon which to build up our irish nation loud applause the feudal tenure and the rule of the minority have been the corner stone of english misrule pull out that corner stone break it up destroy it and you undermine english misgovernment applause when we have undermined english misgovernment we have paved the way for ireland to take her place among the nations of the earth applause and let us not forget that that is the ultimate goal at which all us irishmen aim none of us whether we are in america or in ireland or wherever we may be will be satisfied until we have destroyed the last link which keeps ireland bound to england applause\n",

      "the cork speech of mr parnell is thus paraphrased and commented on by the times italics first the farmer is to pay no rent the land act and the judicial rents that have been fixed for fifteen years are to go where other land acts have gone before into the limbo of obsolete attempts to settle the irish question secondly there is to be protection for irish industry and the farmer being relieved of the necessity of paying anything to his landlord is to be asked and no doubt put down and coerced if he refuses to pay a good deal more than he need for his plough his coat and his farm fittings thus irish manufactures are to be bolstered up at the expense of the irish farmer and labourer sir stafford northcote confesses to a little hankering after what is called reciprocity in matters of trade how would mr parnell like it if reciprocity were tried between england and ireland and if his movement for boycotting english cottons and hardware were answered on this side in the direction of boycotting irish cattle and butter the third plank in the parnellite platform is to be the elevation of the labourer of that waif and stray who was ignored in the days of the land league but who now when his vote will count as much as his master's must be flattered and courted in his turn the labourer is to have his bit of the land rent free of course and woe to the farmer or the landlord whose prejudices stand in his way farmer and landlord in such a case must each be put down and coerced lastly there comes the question of the rights which were stolen from ireland which as mr parnell goes on to explain means the right to a parliament on college green he declines to forecast the future so far as to state either by what means this restitution will be brought about or the extent to which the rights are to go but his hints are tolerably clear ireland he says cannot be content with less than grattan parliament while under the british constitution more could not be asked for\n",

      "when the prime minister passionately declared in the debates upon the franchise bill that he never never would consent to divide the population of ireland into a minority of loyalists and a disloyal majority he must have been perfectly conscious that the separation in question was already accomplished and that none had contributed to its accomplishment more potently than himself he wanted however the support of the parnellites to swell his majority and with reckless disregard for the acknowledged facts of the situation he proceeded for party and personal ends to give the irish nationalists the powers which lord hartington had just pronounced it madness to bestow yesterday the man whom mr gladstone law officers described as steeped in treason to the lips and whom mr gladstone himself fist imprisoned and then admitted to his confidence in the framing of ministerial measures for the government of ireland stated with his customary clearness and precision the use he intends to make of the overwhelming majority permanently secured to him by the tactics of the prime minister the existence of that majority has been recognized by all parties in ireland since the fatal decision to include that country in the franchise bill its absolute submissiveness to the dictates of the chief has been strikingly shown by the circumstances of the late election in tipperary it will accept without question or demur whatever programme its leader lays before it and whatever means he thinks proper for accomplishing his ends whether we wrong the members of such a party by calling them disloyal we are satisfied to decide by the contents of yesterday manifesto two clear lines of action are indicated by mr parnell the irish parliamentary party strongly reinforced after the general election will continue to pursue the constitutional arguments and methods which have already achieved such great results in the legislature behind them will stand the land league under the new name it has received in deference to mr trevelyan the irish members could do little did they not feel themselves supported by the organization of the country behind them even obstruction and the traffic in votes are feeble instruments compared to the coercion of recalcitrant classes which can only be brought about by the terrible sanctions that crushed out opposition three years ago such is the machinery on which mr parnell himself relies but he is careful not to discourage the better men who may come after him and who in other times and other circumstances may work out by other means that complete separation from england to which the irish leader at least believes the vast majority of his countrymen aspire the immediate policy of the separatists is as usual well conceived for the attainment of the ulterior aims they have avowed they will ask that the industry of the irish farmer shall no longer be fettered by rent he will be expected in return to encourage irish manufactures by boycotting english and foreign goods even when they are cheaper and better than the similar articles produced at home and above all the farmers must make up their minds to fulfil their long neglected duties to the labourers we consider says the president of the national league in words of significant menace that whatever class tries to obstruct the labourer in the possession of those fair and just rights to which he is entitled that class should be put down and coerced if you will into doing justice to the labourer for the labourer has now a vote and it may be a preponderant vote and his allegiance must at all risks be secured the policy and tactics of are to be revived with their old thoroughness and vigour the classes politically strong are to be bribed by the spoils of those who are politically weak terrorism is to be employed unsparingly in the country and obstruction in the house of commons with the improved means placed at his disposal by the party necessities of the government the separatist champion can well look forward to the future with a light heart but he does not discern the end we cannot he indeed declares ask for less than the restitution of grattan parliament we cannot under the british constitution ask for more but no man has the right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation no man has a right to say to his country thus far shalt thou go and no further we have never attempted to fix the ne plus ultra italics to the progress of ireland nationhood and we never shall such are the stirring words of the man who exercises boundless power over irish democracy the democracy which mr gladstone refuses to call disloyal such is the policy of the men whom certain english politicians profess to consider as constitutional defenders of their country dismemberment is their all but avowed end\n",

to the change which has since taken place hear hear altogether leaving aside the great extension to the constituency which the franchise act has made you have since shown in the election of my able colleague mr deasy cheers that it is no trouble for you to elect any number of nationalists applause and the present constituency of cork under the franchise act will leave you in a position free from care so far as the choice of your representative goes i do not suppose that the will of cork will ever again be contested by the oligarchy in this city at the election in i laid certain principles before you and you accepted them applause and cries of we do i said and i pledged myself that i should form one of an independent irish party to act in opposition to every english government which refused to concede the just rights of ireland applause and the longer time which is gone by since then the more i am convinced that that is the true policy to pursue so far as parliamentary policy is concerned and that it will be impossible for either or both of the english parties to contend for any long time against a determined band of irishmen acting honestly upon these principles and backed by the irish people cheers but we have not alone had that object in view we have always been very careful not to fetter or control the people at home in any way not to prevent them from doing anything by their own strength which it is possible for them to do sometimes perhaps in our anxiety in this direction we have asked them to do what is beyond their strength but i hold that it is better even to encourage you to do what is beyond your strength even should you fail sometimes in the attempt than to teach you to be subservient and unreliant applause you have been encouraged to organise yourselves to depend upon the rectitude of your cause for your justification and to depend upon the determination which has helped irishmen through many centuries to retain the name of ireland and to retain her nationhood nobody could point to any single action of ours in the house of commons or out of it which was not based upon the knowledge that behind us existed a strong and brave people that without the help of the people our exertions would be as nothing and that with their help and with their confidence we should be as i believe we shall prove to be in the near future invincible and unconquerable great applause the electors the old electors the electors who will be swamped laughter in the great mass of irishmen now admitted to the rights of the constitution so far as they existed in this country were on the whole faithful to their trust indeed it was not until we showed by a good many proofs that we could do without an enlargement of the franchise and that with the old restricted suffrage we could do all that was necessary in the way of parliamentary operations that the opposition to the admission of the masses of the irish people to the franchise disappeared applause but i look forward to the future with a light heart i am convinced that the five hundred or six hundred thousand irishmen who within a year must vote for the men of their choice will be as true to ireland even truer to ireland than those who have gone before them and that we safely trust to them the exercise of the great and important privilege unequalled in its greatness and its magnitude in the history of any nation which will shortly be placed upon them i am convinced that when the reckoning comes up after the general election of that we in ireland shall have cause to congratulate ourselves in the possession of a strong party which will bear down all opposition and which aided by the organisation of our country behind us will enable us to gain for our country those rights which were stolen from us cheers we shall struggle as we have been struggling for the great and important interests of the irish tenant farmer we shall ask that his industry shall not be fettered by rent we shall ask also from the farmer in return that he shall not think it too great a sacrifice to be called upon when he wants anything when he has to purchase anything to consider how he may get it of irish material and manufacture hear hear even suppose he has to pay a little more for it cheers i am sorry if the agricultural population has shown itself somewhat deficient in its sense of its duty in this respect up to the present time but i feel convinced that the matter has only to be put before them to secure the opening up of most important markets in this country for those manufactures which have always existed and for those which have been reopened anew as a consequence of the recent exhibitions the great exhibition in dublin and the other equally great one in cork which have been recently held cheers we shall also endeavour to secure for the labourer some recognition and some right in the land of his country applause we don't care whether it be the prejudices of the farmer or of the landlord that stands in his way hear hear we consider that whatever class tries to obstruct the labourer in the possession of those fair and just rights to which he is entitled that class should be put down and coerced if you will into doing justice to the labourer we have shown our desire to benefit the labourer by the passage of the labourers act which if maimed and mutilated in many of its provisions undoubtedly do much good for that class and undoubtedly will secure for the labouring classes a portion of what we have been striving to secure for them well but gentlemen i go back from the consideration of these questions to the land question in which the labourers question is also involved and the manufacturers question i come back and every irish politician must be forcibly driven back to the consideration of the great question of national self government for ireland cheers i do not know how this great question will be eventually settled i do not know whether england will be wise in time and concede to constitutional arguments and methods the restitution of that which was stolen from us towards the close of the last century cheers it is given to none of us to forecast the future and just as it is impossible for us to say in what way or by what means the national question may be settled in what way full justice may be done to ireland so it is impossible for us to say to what extent that justice should be done underlined we cannot ask for less than the restitution of grattan parliament underlined loud cheers with its important privileges and wide and far reaching constitution we cannot under the british constitution ask for more than the restitution of grattan parliament renewed cheers underlined but no man has the right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation great cheers underlined no man has the right to say to his country underlined thus far shalt underlined thou go and no further and we have never attempted underlined to fix the ne plus ultra to the progress of ireland nationhood and we never shall cheers underlined but gentlemen while we leave those things to time circumstances and the future we must each one of us resolve in our own hearts that we shall at all times do everything that within us les to obtain for ireland the fullest measure of her rights applause in this way we shall avoid difficulties and contentions amongst each other in this way we shall not give up anything which the future may put in favour of our country and while we struggle to day for that which may seem possible for us with our combination we must struggle for it with the proud consciousness that we shall not do anything to hinder or prevent better men who may come after us from gaining better things than those for which we now contend prolonged applause\n",

      "an overcrowded meeting of the irish electors of liverpool was held in the concert hall in that city yesterday afternoon to hear an address from mr parnell as great numbers of people were unable to obtain admission mr parnell subsequently addressed a crowd of about in the open air in front of st george's hall dr a m bligh c c presided in the concert hall and on mr parnell making his appearance he was greeted with deafening cheers which were again and again renewed the packed audience displaying the wildest enthusiasm and waving hats and handkerchiefs mr parnell whose rising was the signal for a renewal of the vehement cheering and waving of hats said irishmen of liverpool you have honoured me by adopting a resolution inviting me to come forward here the speaker was interrupted for some time by a noisy demonstration in the body of the hall and contest the exchange division of liverpool cheers i have given this matter since i last had the opportunity of addressing a liverpool audience the most careful and mature consideration i have felt on the one hand that i ought not to undertake a hopeless contest hear hear on the other hand i have felt that if there was some chance however small of carrying the exchange division i ought not to shirk a contest loud cheers what is the position under the constitution of my fellow countrymen in england and scotland there are two millions or very nearly two millions of irish people either by birth or descent in this country and to these two millions of people the franchise act only provided as far as was apparent representation in a single constituency the scotland division of liverpool what has the franchise done for ireland it has provided for the two english parties in ireland numbering under one million of persons it has endeavoured to provide by gerrymandering a representation of members and it has probably actually provided as the result of the elections will show a representation of about from to members so we see on the one side that the irish people in england are only allowed a representation of one member in parliament although they number nearly two million persons and on the other side the english people in ireland are allowed a representation of members shame my fellow countrymen you will admit that that is a very glaring injustice and that both the political parties in liverpool might reasonably have been called upon to give us the two seats of scotland division and the exchange division without a contest loud cheers there are irish voters in this city and they are certainly entitled to a representation of more than one member hear hear these considerations influenced me very largely in deciding to accept as i do to night your invitation to contest the exchange division loud cheers and we mean to win the contest will be a very difficult one a voice never mind you will win but i believe that favoured by fortunate circumstances and by the energetic help of the irish people of liverpool it is just possible for me to win loud cheers mr t p o'connor was adopted at the last meeting that we held in a neighbouring hall and we shall now have two irish candidates coming forward for two divisions of liverpool as regards the other divisions these matters are still under consideration hear hear but i think that it is probable that we shall also put forward candidates from among well known members of the late irish parliamentary party for the divisions of kirkdale loud cheers west toxteth cheers abercromby cheers and the bootle division of lancashire loud cheers these matters have not as yet been definitely decided they are still under consideration and we have of course from this time until close upon o'clock to morrow to make up our minds cheers we now have to consider our situation not only in liverpool but throughout the whole country an important manifesto was drawn up in consultation with me on saturday and issued to the irish electors of great britain that manifesto recommends the irish electors everywhere to vote for the conservative candidates against either the liberals or the radicals loud cheers i fully and cordially approve every word of that recommendation and i recognize in your faithful adherence to the terms of that recommendation the only safety for ireland and her people we considered the matter long and carefully and it was absolutely impossible for us in the face of facts and of past occurrences and future probabilities to give you any other recommendation cheers i trust that the irish electors of england and scotland will not be found wanting that they will cast aside every local consideration regardless of personal interests or predilections and that they will go solid we hope it will be the last time that we shall be obliged to call upon you for your help and that you will this time go solid against the oppressors of your country loud and prolonged cheers the manifesto that i have alluded to made some reference to exceptions i do not think there will be any exception in liverpool i do not think there will be no no and i know that there will be few if any exceptions throughout the whole country i think the exceptions in favour of any radicals might be counted in two figures throughout the whole of england and scotland cheers but if there should be any exception in liverpool the fact will be communicated to you before the polling day i do not know of any myself at the present moment let me remind you of the reasons which weighed upon us in coming to this decision we had on the one hand the fact that ireland during the last five years has been scourged in an unexampled fashion by the leaders of the liberal party hear hear and a voice bad luck to them for some two years under the first coercion act no man liberty in ireland was safe i and a thousand other respectable men in ireland were imprisoned without trial shame and while we were there when our mouths were shut and we were unable to defend ourselves our characters were taken away in parliament by the leaders of the liberal party hooting but they did not stop at the imprisonment of men they even ventured upon imprisoning ladies shame at one time a hundred cells had been prepared in a prison in dublin for the reception of the ladies of ireland shame who were carrying on the work the national work of the land league during the imprisonment of the men a voice bravo ladies three cheers for the ladies and in several instances they did not hesitate to arrest under an old and obsolete act of parliament ladies of the land league who were sustaining evicted tenants throughout the country doing in fact the work of charity however they were not satisfied with the coercion act immediately on or even before the expiration of the act they pressed parliament for further powers and they got them they got what they called the prevention of crimes act but which was commonly known afterwards as the crimes act i believe that there were more judicial murders more false imprisonment more crimes committed against the people under that act than all the crimes together which the people in their extremity committed during the whole of the land league movement cheers throughout the duration of that crimes act no man life was safe every man liberty was at stake many persons were arrested received the mockery of a trial and were condemned to death many other innocent persons a voice miles joyce were condemned to penal servitude and are still suffering that shame and a voice we will have them out and when the present government agreed to an inquiry into the misdeeds of their predecessors what was the action of the liberal party they rose up and attempted to intimidate lord carnarvon from carrying out his duty as a christian and as a ruler of the country they attempted to double lock the doors upon those innocent persons and at the very moment that we succeeded in hurling the late government from power loud and prolonged cheers by what i can only regard as a dispensation of providence or fortune so happy for ireland is in its results at that very moment fellow countrymen they were planning among themselves how they could best renew the worst features of the coercion act the jury packing clauses and the intimidation clauses a voice what did the conservative government do i do not care what any government does for ireland i want liberty for ireland loud and prolonged cheers our liberty was taken away by the liberals and it was partially restored to us by the tories and i am bound to say that i believe that the irishman in this election who votes for a liberal or radical candidate will be voting as much as lies in his power to hand us back into chains imprisonment and death loud cheers i will put the case before you at as much length as i think it well to do to night considering the terribly crowded state of this hall i ask you to disregard every terrible consideration that the particular trade to which you may belong may be benefited by the return of a particular candidate or that a particular candidate is a popular man i ask you to disregard every personal and local consideration except the one that it is our duty to weaken the liberal party at the present moment cheers i have every confidence that you will do this and that however much it may be against the grain of many of you to vote for the conservative for the tory that you will do it upon this occasion because i believe you have that confidence in us loud cheers i believe that too cheers it is no longer a question as to how much home rule or self government we shall get it is no longer a question whether we shall get home rule or the right of ruling ourselves the question is how much of it they will be able to cheat us out of a voice they won't cheat you out of much that is one consolation laughter mr gladstone hooting and hisses has plainly intimated that if he succeeds in getting into power with a big majority he will try and cheat us out of a good deal of it a voice it won't be done but nothing in the world would induce me to accept on behalf of the irish people anything but the fullest and completest control over our own affairs loud cheers i believe that a halting and inefficient measure would be fatal to the interests of both england and ireland it would leave room for further agitation england would be continually embroiled in our own disputes over there a voice she likes it but i believe that if advantage is taken of the present movement ireland will have it virtually in her power for the first time to return her own representatives men representing her feeling really and truly and able to offer a great settlement of the irish national question i believe that the result of that settlement will be to terminate the interminable strife of centuries and to bring prosperity and contentment to our country loud and prolonged cheers at the meeting in front of st george's hall mr parnell who spoke from a lorry said people of liverpool i cannot attempt to deliver an address to this vast assembly but i will take this opportunity of thanking you for your kindness in coming without notice in such vast numbers to welcome me at the commencement of my candidature cheers it is now just six years since i stood on this very spot and addressed a similar meeting at a time of great crisis in the affairs of our country cheers at that time i was just on the eve of my expedition to the great united states of america with john dillon where we laid the foundation of the great league movement which has done so much for ireland cheers that movement is continued to day in the organization of the national league i am here as the representative of that movement to ask the suffrages of the irish people in the exchange division cheers there will be a difficult and a tedious battle before us but with pluck energy and determination i believe that it is just possible to win it cheers and now i will say a word upon the general questions of the day you know that a manifesto has been issued by the leaders of the irish movement in england asking the irish electors everywhere to vote against the liberals and the radicals cheers and in favour of the tories loud cheers with that manifesto i heartily concur cheers it was drawn up with my approval and my sanction cheers and i will only say this with regard to it that i trust every irishman no matter what his personal interests may be will cast his vote against the liberal party cheers the liberals gave us chains imprisonment and death and the tories for the first time after five years when they came into power gave us some little measure of freedom i do not care what measures the liberal party passed what we want for ireland is that she shall have control over her own destinies what we want is that ireland shall have the power to make her own laws cheers without the bungling and fumbling and obstruction of the imperial parliament and that to our people at home shall be handed over the right of attending to their own concerns and managing their own business cheers believe me fellow countrymen if you at this momentous crisis in the affairs of ireland do what we have asked you to do you will be doing a most important service to us and an incalculable service to yourselves in obtaining a restitution of her national rights for ireland cheers i believe that if you do this service it will be the last time that we shall be obliged to call upon you to lay aside your own interests i am confident you will stand true to us and that by this the final service as we believe that we shall have to ask at your hands you will deliver a complete and crushing blow against the enemies of our country\n",

      "mr parnell on rising to speak was received with loud cheers he said mr chairman and men of plymouth i am indebted to our chairman as he has told you very much indebted for the invitation which he extended to me to visit this portion of the counties of cornwall and devonshire and it is a very great pleasure to me personally to have an opportunity of coming in contact with the stalwart population of the south west of england i have never been so far down in this direction before although some of the earlier years of my life were spent at a school in the neighbouring county of somerset and it is a curious fact that it was the school of plymouth brothers so that any mischief that you may be disposed to admit to me great laughter as well as some good some little good cheers that some of you may be disposed to admit i have done in the course of my life cheers you must in fairness attribute it or at all events a portion of it to the very excellent teaching which i received in my earlier years to which i shall always look back with the greatest reverence affection and respect from my pastors and masters in the neighbouring county of somerset your chairman has truly reminded you that this is a struggle of the democracies of the two countries england and ireland and it is the first time that it was possible for them to come together cheers and they have lost no time about it and it is to the credit of the innate perception and good feeling of the people of england and ireland that within a few months after they were enfranchised they have taken and shaken each other by the hand loud and prolonged cheering no sir the anglo irish quarrel has not been a quarrel between the democracies of the two countries the peoples of neither country have been responsible for it and we have never and i have never thought to attribute to the democracy of england or scotland any share in the blame for the misgovernment of ireland i recognize that the misgovernment has been the calculated engine of the privileged classes loud cheers against whom you have to struggle quite as much as we have and by whom the misrepresentation with which it is sought to overwhelm our cause has been sedulously propagated for their own purposes cheers no the responsibility does not rest upon the democracy of england but the responsibility will rest upon them if after full consideration and examination the democracy of england should reject the prayer of ireland cheers but i have no fear of such a result it has been a fortunate and a happy thing for my country that this question has fallen into the hands of that great man that greatest man cheers in whom we recognize the ability and the willingness to settle this question we believe that no other englishman could have been potent enough to settle it so i say it is a happy and a fortunate thing for ireland that she has found such a champion cheers in his older days at a time when other men would have sought repose his duty has been plainly pointed out to his conscience he has disregarded the claims of perhaps failing health and with an extraordinary vigour mental as well as physical which no other man could have equalled he has thrown his whole heart into this last effort of his to do justice to ireland and to settle for ever this long standing quarrel between the two nations and whether he succeeds or fails ireland will always be grateful to him cheers his words will have been left as a legacy for succeeding englishmen and they can never die cheers having opened the way even should he fail loud cheers for a man who has never failed in anything yet is not going to fail when he appeals to the newly enfranchised masses of great britain cheers he will i say in any case have pointed out the way for the english people that way will be clear and made open and our nation will be given that justice that it is mr gladstone desire she should have cheers now fellow countrymen cheers if this enormous and gigantic meeting can have patience with me let me go into a few disputed details of this question let me touch first of all upon the land question now the land question has interested us very much in ireland because it has been a case of life or death to our people we have not had the manufacturing industries upon which you have fallen back in great britain for your support but for these you would have had no nation if you had been left to the tender mercies of the landlords in england you would not have had as much of a nation in england as we have in ireland cheers as i go through the country and see the vast distances which intervene between the habitations of the people i am tempted to say that the hand of the landlord has been as heavy upon the people of england as it has been upon the people of ireland cheers but you have had some other resources to fall back upon interruptions and a voice phoenix park and you have not been drifting into deep sea as our people have been and consequently the land question has not attracted so much attention or been so pressing and prinching sic in england as it has been in ireland but the land has been the only resource of the irish people they have been obliged to stick to the land and when they have been driven off it they have died in the workhouse they have perished in rotten emigrant ships and the remainder of them have found that home beyond the atlantic which was denied to them in their own country well then the land question is a great and pressing question in ireland you know that mr gladstone sought to settle it by a land purchase bill this bill would have extended very favourable terms to the irish landlords a voice too favourable i agree with my friend that the terms would have been too favourable cheers but the irish people in return for the settlement of the national question would have permitted them to go to work in the direction of the development of the resources of their own country to open up their mines to drain their swamps to build their harbours and to make railways when necessary the irish people would have been willing to have given the landlords much too favourable terms in order to be quit of them and the only condition we had in our minds was this that the landlords should not be given so much as would render it impossible for the tenants to pay the annual instalments and so throw any loss upon the british taxpayer cheers we did not consider that we were entitled to ask the working men of england to share or to contribute one farthing towards the expense of getting rid of the irish landlords cheers we were willing to do it ourselves and we believe that by making sacrifices and under mr gladstone land purchase bill not a penny of the cost would ever have fallen upon the british taxpayer cheers now that was the principle i kept in my mind in dealing with mr gladstone land purchase bill i admit it was too good a settlement for the landlords but the landlords have saved any compunction of conscience on that score by being so idiotic as to reject it laughter and they will never hear anything more about that bill there are several ways of settling the irish land question besides giving or years purchase to the irish landlords i will tell you a way of settling it i will tell you a much better way of settling it than by handing or millions of money to the irish landlords let me carry you back for two or three years in parliamentary history you will remember that mr gladstone passed a land act for ireland and that great results were expected from that land act but two things happened one of them before the act was passed and another immediately afterwards which prevented me and my friends from having any expectation whatever that the land act would settle the irish question and bear this in mind for a moment because the thing is an argument in reference to the home rule bill of mr gladstone it is said that the irish have never been satisfied with any bill that was passed for them that they have never taken it as a final settlement that they did not take the land act as a final settlement and that they will not take the home rule bill as a final settlement i say in reply to that that the nationalists of ireland never accepted any bill coming from the english parliament as a final settlement of any question until this bill was introduced and that we come before you with clear consciences in that respect we have never given you to suppose that we would take any measure that was brought forward as a final settlement of any question until this measure was brought forward and at the time of the passing of the land act we expressly warned you that it could not settle the question we did more than that many of us sealed our belief in our own words by suffering imprisonment loud cheers well what were these two things which happened at the time of the passing of the land act which deprived us of any confidence in that enactment i will tell you shortly there was a clause which was introduced by the irish members into that act which provided that no rent should be charged upon any improvement made by a tenant or his predecessors in title that clause was passed by the house of commons but when the bill containing it went to the house of lords laughter and groans they said to themselves it will never do to allow this clause to pass into law it will be made a precedent with regard to english legislation and we landlords in england for of course the house of lords is a house of landlords cheers will by and by have the same measure meted out to us that the house of commons has meted out to the irish landlords the house of lords acting upon this consideration to a great extent emasculated that clause though it was not destroyed entirely it was sent back to the house of commons and the government very wisely as i think agreed to the amendment in a great portion at all events the clause by this amendment was to a large extent rendered valueless for the purpose of protecting the improvements of the irish tenant however it was not entirely useless there was a little good left in it but even that was entirely taken out of it shortly afterwards by an interpretation put upon the clause by the majority of the judges in the supreme court of appeal in dublin and the result of that interpretation combined with the previous mutilation of the measure in the house of lords was to render that important clause perfectly useless for its purpose and to destroy the utility of the act now if we knowing this to be so had failed to say so and to warn the english government and the irish people that the act would fail should we not have been dishonest and cowardly yes and cheers well the act failed i must tell you by way of remark in passing that there was a very close division on the judgment in the supreme court of appeal in dublin that it was only carried by a majority of one in a full bench of judges and that it so happened that all the tory judges voted on one side and all the liberals including the lord chancellor on the other but the tory judges were in a majority and they carried the appeal against the irish tenants and destroyed the land act now that is a short history of the irish land act and we had failed still to settle the irish land question i tell you this that speaking shortly one way to settle the irish land question would be to reduce the statutory term of tenure from years to five and to restore the improvements clause of the land act to the state in which it was left by the house of commons these two terms taken together would reduce the present judicial rents by at least or per cent from the standard fixed by the court a standard which the tenants are utterly unable to pay and live at the same time it is a measure which would not hurt the pockets of the english taxpayers but it is also a thing that the landlords would not like nearly so much as or millions of money however the irish landlords have put this matter out of court in respect to their feelings or ideas being taken into consideration the matter is now gone before the democracy of the two countries and it will have to be decided by them cheers and the position of the irish landlords will be something very like that which is depicted of the drowning crew in virgil line rari nantes in gurgite vasto when the ship had been shipwrecked a few of the mariners were seen swimming here and there a few of them struggling in the vast whirlpool and they were soon overwhelmed so it will be by the irish landlords who allowed the sands in the hour glass to run down and who rejected mr gladstone generous offer cheers and now i think i have shown you that you need not be apprehensive as regards this question of the or millions which has been brought forward by mr chamberlain groans and mr trevelyan groans mr trevelyan has been one of the gentlemen who has joined with mr chamberlain cheers and groans in protesting against this tax as they call it of millions being placed upon the english working classes but it is a remarkable fact that mr trevelyan himself in the last parliament brought forward a bill for the purpose of giving or millions i am not certain of which oh to the irish landlords at the expense of the british taxpayer and without any of the guarantees with which mr gladstone has surrounded his proposal but the question of giving money to the irish landlords is out of the matter altogether and you may dismiss it from your minds the point for you to come at is whether you will do as mr gladstone wants you to do no and yes whether you will give the right of self government to ireland or whether you will not cheers i believe that there will be every desire on the part of the irish people to give them more than they ought to get but it will be a settlement which cannot be so good as the settlement which was offered to them by mr gladstone i now come to the simple question of whether you will give to ireland the right to manage her own domestic business loud cheers i pointed out at portsmouth last night that imperial unity does not require or necessitate that there should be a union of parliaments i took for an example the case of your colonies who are united and who wish to be united in your empire not because they have not a separate legislatures sic not because they have got a representation in the imperial parliament but because they have got no representation in the imperial parliament hear hear i pointed out that rebellion in canada had been checked and that a feeling of disloyalty on the part of the french canadians had been changed into a feeling of loyalty by the concession of a constitution to them cheers i pointed out that there are many examples of separate legislatures with power over domestic business in the colonies within the british empire and that these separate legislatures so far from contributing to discontent had prevented discontent and created loyalty i pointed out the example of the great united states of america where there are separate legislatures i am remined by a friend on the platform that there is a 39th legislature which is now being born at the present moment then you have in the united states of america separate legislatures with powers in excess and largely in excess of those mr gladstone proposes to give us in this bill cheers the people of each state of the american union have the right of appointed their own governor by universal suffrage cheers we don't claim that right we leave the imperial parliament the duty of appointing the lord lieutenant of ireland each state of the american union has the right of appointing the judges of the state and paying them and dismissing them we shall not be able to appoint any judges until at least half the present judges and they are all fairly young men have either died or retired there are just twice too many judges in ireland for notwithstanding what you have been told the people are a very law abiding people cheers and there is very little litigation there we shall not i say have the power of appointing a single judge until half of the present judges have either retired or died we shall never have the right of dismissing a judge except with the consent of the protestant minority in ireland represented by the first order hear hear as regards the militia each state of the american union has the right of levying and controlling the militia of the state and of appointing the officers thereof we have no control whatever over the militia they would remain under the imperial authority as at present hear hear and then there are as many other points of difference of detail in favour of state rights in america which i should weary this great meeting by going into no no but this large concession of power to the states in america does not interfere with federal union which answers to the same thing as imperial union in this country on the contrary it strengthens and consolidates it hear hear when the southern states of america tried to leave the union the northern states had the conscience not only their own conscience but the conscience of the civilized world in approval of their course in keeping them within the union and it would be the same with you if after you have conceded state rights would be in comparison with those enjoyed by the states of america any demand were made to separate from england by force you would have that moral influence and authority in compelling ireland to remain within your imperial union which you have not now got loud cheers but you can never have this until you yield these concessions to irish opinions cheers a voice what about ulster cheers and counter cheers now men of plymouth i have shown you the examples of your colonies i will not trouble you by going over those presented in european countries where the relations were similar to those between england and ireland and where concessions of autonomy have settled the difficulty and strife between them i have shown you the example presented by the united states of america and i ask you who in the name of common sense prevents the english people from doing this small justice to ireland cheers you cannot you a great and a rich people over millions strong with colonies attached to you and ready to help you at the signal you cannot surely be afraid of little miserable ireland with her five millions of people loud cheers you cannot really fear that such a concession to ireland can possibly endanger your empire no no why to hear the talk that goes on one would think that ireland was inhabited by a people equally numerous and equally rich with yourselves instead of a people few in number reduced to the last stage of depression poverty and misery by long continued misgovernment cheers oh no sensible men do not really fear these things and the people of this country when the issue has been explained to them will not believe in these fears or any of them this battle is being waged against ireland by a class of landlords their loyalty that they boast of is loyalty to their own pockets loud cheers have they not repeatedly threatened not now for the first time that if the queen lords and commons of england pass a certain act they will rebel against the imperial authority is that loyalty no no much fight there is in them loud laughter and cheers i know these gentry well laughter the talk about the protestants of ireland of whom i am proud to be one cheers the protestants of ireland despise this miserable gang who trade upon the name of religion they despise them and appraise them at their full worth they threatened to rebel when the irish church was disestablished they threatened to rebel when the first land act of was passed and now they threatened to rebel again laughter all i can say is that men of the royal irish constabulary a soldier or the royal irish regiment cheers will be amply sufficient to cope with all the rebels that the orangemen of the north of ireland can produce hisses they would be just taken like corner boys and street rowdies and they would be locked up in the police barracks cheers this is another of the alarms that are raised that the protestant minority of ireland will be injured well now i wish to point out to you that this cry is not really raised by the protestants of ireland at all it is raised by a few fanatical orangemen in the north of ireland the protestants of ireland are not a bit afraid of either the pope or the papists cheers the great majority of them and i know them well are pretty much indifferent upon this question of the two things they would probably rather have matters left as they are but they have not any very strong feeling one way or the other there is a small minority strongly in favour of the bill and there is another minority larger in numbers but not much larger who represent the party of violent resistance so you need not regard this talk at all about the fear of the protestants of ireland we are not a bit afraid of the roman catholics i do not know whether there are any cornishmen here to night or not loud cries of yes i live and was born in a portion of the county of wicklow which is a mining county and a good many cornishmen have come over to that county within the last fifty years for the purpose of showing us how to work the mines they have been captains and managers and so forth and we have been very glad to have them they have been all protestants principally nonconformist protestants they have built their little churches over at wicklow where they worship god according to their own consciences wicklow is a catholic county nine tenths of the people are catholic many scores of these cornishmen must have come and gone in wicklow within the last years and i believe there is not one of them if you appeal to them who have lived among this catholic population who would not tell you that his right to worship god according to his own religion has been as secure in catholic wicklow and as little assailed by the catholics of that county as it would have been in cornwall loud cheers no protestant cornishman who has ever come to wicklow has been asked what his religion was they have been admired and respected as god serving and pious men as men attentive and conscientious in the discharge of their duty and they have been looked up to universally by their catholic neighbours as men of whom we would welcome among us many hundreds more besides hear hear now i am an employer i trust you will excuse me for alluding to a personal matter but i am an employer of labour to some extent in the county of wicklow i have got some quarries there and i have a great many men employed the majority of the men who work the quarries are catholics as is natural in a catholic county but we have many orangemen from the north of ireland working side by side with them and we have welshmen from wales but no single angry word has ever been given by any catholic workman to either orangeman or welshman or ever will be given loud cheers but this expression of panic and of fear on the part of the orangemen for it does not come from any other of the protestants comes from a place and part of ireland where the protestants are in the great majority it comes mainly from belfast and the north east corner of ulster hear but where the protestants are few in number where they are living all over ireland scattered about among their catholic fellow countrymen we do not hear any expressions of alarm or fear from them all the expressions of alarm or fear from them all the expressions of fear and of panic have been from the orangemen of the north of ireland and it reminds me of nothing so much as the wolf complaining that the lamb was muddying the water hear hear the lamb pointed out to the wolf that it was drinking lower down the stream than the wolf and could not possibly muddy the water that was being drunk by the wolf but that was not sufficient for the wolf and he turned on the lamb and rent it and this is the attitude of this small minority of protestants but i thank god as a protestant that it is a very small minority cheers these men seek to get their foot upon the necks of the majority in ireland it is not fair play and they know it well enough hear hear and if fair play were wanting on the part of the majority of irishmen then i say it would be just and right if irishmen so far forgot the honour of their country and the public opinion of the world as to revert to the bigoted sectarian oppressions of the middle ages for englishmen to step in and take away this great privilege which irishmen would then be proved to have abused now i turn from this question of protection for the minority with the remark that that protection for the minority with the remark that that protection is amply provided for under the provisions of the bill because not a single act of parliament can be passed without the consent of the first order which will be under the control of the minority if the first order refuses its consent that act will be hung up for three years and during that three years there would be ample opportunity given to the english people to decide whether that enactment was fair or unfair to the irish minority and if it were unfair to treat the matter accordingly now i have nearly come to the end of what i have to say to you i recognize how very fatiguing it must be for a crowded meeting such as this is to stand on their feet all the time during my long address and i shall finish up very quickly after i have made some reference to what is now known as the carnarvon incident laughter it is a very favourable device with politicians when they are accused of one thing to say not that they did not do that thing but that they did not do something else hear and when i stated that i had reason to believe that the tories if they had a majority at the polls would have given us a statutory legislature with a power of protecting irish industries against the products of british factories sir michael hicks beach contradicted me by saying that the cabinet had not agreed to do that laughter well i never said that the cabinet had agreed to do it from the very nature of the case the cabinet could not have agreed to do it because the matter was not ripe for final judgment and could not have become ripe until the result of the general election was known but what i say is this the leading man who was responsible in the cabinet for the government of ireland a man in the high position of lord lieutenant hear asked me to meet him in london for the purpose of consulting with me and learning my views and giving me his opinion with regard to a constitution for ireland cheers now a constitution for ireland can only have meant a parliamentary constitution and it has not been denied and cannot be denied secondly i say that during that interview i found that lord carnarvon groans do not hiss or hoot him he was the only gentleman in the late cabinet lord carnarvon agreed with me in the main lines on which a constitution for ireland might be granted by the giving of the statutory legislature hear hear lord carnarvon does not deny that but what he denies is this he says i do not agree with mr gladstone bill well i never said that lord carnarvon agreed with mr gladstone bill but i said that he agreed with me at the beginning of last august regarding the lines upon which the irish national question should be settled cheers it is very likely that he does not agree with all the points in mr gladstone bill i do not agree with all the points in mr gladstone bill a great many people on one side and another do not agree with all the points in mr gladstone bill i agree with mr gladstone bill in the main cheers and i know that if there had been a shorthand writer present at my conversation with lord carnarvon last august he would have been found also to have agreed with mr gladstone bill cheers there are important points of difference very probably but i do not wish to make any further disclosures cries of go on and cheers very probably lord carnarvon in his constitution would like to keep the irish members at westminster in order to vote down radical measures laughter but there is another assertion that i have made which has not been attempted to be denied and it is this lord carnarvon has not denied my assertion that he urged these views on the cabinet for six months and that although the time for the cabinet to take a final decision did not become ripe until after the result of the general election was known yet notwithstanding during the whole of those six months lord carnarvon was not opposed in the cabinet to any extent and i make another assertion now which lord carnarvon will not deny either if his views had been opposed in the cabinet during those six months so as to make him believe that he could not have carried them he would have resigned his office loud cheers and he never did resign office until the result of the general election and our failure to give the tories a majority swung the cabinet round into opposition to his views cheers now i think i may leave lord carnarvon with these two or three assertions after making a further statement lord carnarvon has stated that he spoke to me unofficially well he has been asked by mr gladstone to give his version of what he said to me and of what he said to lord salisbury afterwards this request has been made by mr gladstone not once but twice and the british public are entitled to have an answer cheers i have given my version of a portion of what took place at the interview let lord carnarvon give his cheers he says that he spoke to me unofficially i want to know how much of what i said to him he communicated to the cabinet lord carnarvon as the result of that interview and as the result of what passed between us gave me earnest of his official capacity during the interview and very good earnest too he gave me five millions of money cheers and groans i say he gave me earnest of his official capacity at that interview interruption caused by a squad of youths singing rule britannia which was met with overwhelming cheers for parnell ah these gentlemen are afraid of hearing the truth loud cheers he gave me earnest of his official capacity not for myself but for the irish landlords in the shape of five millions sterling money of the british taxpayers and within a week after that interview at my request made at that interview and at my strong recommendation he passed the land purchase act it would not otherwise have been passed giving five millions of your money to the irish landlords cheers was that an official act or not loud cries of yes arising out of that interview cheers did he communicate anything about my recommendation to pass that land purchase bill and a larger land purchase bill later on as a part of the national sentiment to lord salisbury cheers now i have made a few fresh revelations about lord carnarvon lord randolph churchill of course great groaning is a bird of another feather lord carnarvon is a sensible man and resigned his position when he found he could not carry out the expectations which he had held out to us but lord randolph churchill although he was up to the hilt in the thing too did not resign his office and has only turned right about face laughter he became a denouncer of the very policy for the relief of ireland that he had a month before determined to carry out and now men of plymouth i have expressed my belief that this cause is safe in your hands am i to measure the strength of the opposition by the contemptible interruptions to which i have been subjected hear hear if that is all the unionists of plymouth can do i feel very confident about the result loud cheers i believe that the great heart of the english people has been touched by this question in a way it has never been touched before and that the genius of the illustrious englishman who towers head and shoulders above all other living men cheers for who equal as a statesman and as a philanthropist we have to search the pages of history in vain cheers has shed a new light upon the blood stained pages of irish history that light strong as truth bright as the sun will never fail until you have thoroughly read the words written on those pages and when you have read that book you will come to the conclusion that neither landlord tyranny nor orange bigotry shall continue to blind you to the suffering of the sister nation or prevent you any longer from doing her that justice which she confidently asks from you loud and continued cheering mr parnell who was loudly cheered on rising to reply said i thank you most heartily for the kindness and general good order with which you have listened to me and i believe that this meeting will have good fruit and good result cheers as i have already said i leave this issue which is simply one of truth and justice and nothing else cheers with confidence in your hands that you will do justice to our nation as well as to your own great empire cheers i could have wished to have spent a longer time among so fine a people but the claims of the great election contest that is now pressing around us draw me elsewhere i trust however in happier and quieter times when the irish and english nations have learnt to understand each other and are bound together only by the terms of affection and respect loud cheers that i may have a further opportunity of making your acquaintance and of admiring some of the features of this beautiful county cheers for myself i can only say that it seemed when i came along in the train to day almost as if i was going back to the days of my boyhood i am pleased that i have had the opportunity of coming among you i am pleased glad and grateful that i have been able to state however imperfectly what the irish cause is and however great may have been the deficiencies in my speech and they undoubtedly exist to a large extent no no do not remember them against me and above all do not permit them to weigh against my countrymen cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with loud and prolonged cheering said i do not know whether at the commencement i ought not to render to you an apology for trespassing into the domain of english politics it is i believe about the first time that i have had the honour of addressing a mainly english audience and i have been induced to do so now because i rely greatly on the spirit of fairplay among the english masses cheers and because the issues for my country are so great and so vital at the present moment the irishman who remains silent when it might be possible to do something to help his country would be more unworthy than tongue could describe mr gladstone cheers was right when he said that this battle was the soldiers battle is not this great meeting a verification of his words it is the people battle it is the soldiers battle and upon the justice of the masses of the british people we rely hear hear i have in my career as a member of parliament never willingly injured the cause of the english working men cheers i have done something to show my sympathy for the masses of the people of this country to take as an illustration i will select for a moment the question of the abolition of flogging in the army hear hear seven or eight years ago it was my privilege to strike with english members a successful blow in favour of the abolition of flogging in the army and the navy we were then met with the very same arguments as we are met with to day and from the same class of persons it was said by the late lord beaconsfield hisses that the integrity of the british empire would be endangered if flogging were abolished laughter and he called a great meeting at one of the ministerial offices in london a great meeting of his supporters both in the lords and in the commons for the purpose of exhorting them to stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of the british empire against the abolition of flogging in the army laughter well we abolished flogging in the army and navy in spite of the tories and in spite of lord hartington and lord salisbury all of whom were then leagued together as defenders of the lash cheers and we shall win this battle too loud cheers i am here to night for the purpose of endeavouring with my poor voice which i am afraid hardly penetrates this great meeting to brush away some of the clouds of prejudice that have been cast before your eyes to prevent you if it were possible from seeing the truth now what is the settlement which mr gladstone and his government have offered us which we have accepted as a final settlement loud cheers and which five sixths of the irish people in a few days hence at the poll will accept as a final settlement you were told that not only the integrity of the empire but the supremacy of the imperial parliament would be endangered i shall show you neither one nor the other will be harmed the statutory legislature which we have accepted is not like grattan parliament a supreme co ordinate parliament but it is a subordinate one hear hear the legislature that we have accepted will have only power to deal with exclusively irish business hear hear grattan parliament had power to deal with imperial affairs and it repeatedly exercised that power it had power to object to foreign wars undertaken by great britain it had separate powers to address the crown against these wars it had power to refuse supplies for the maintenance of the army and navy the new legislature will have none of these powers but we shall have a more valuable power for our own interests exclusively apart from imperial affairs which grattan had not we shall have the power of appointing and controlling our own executive government hear hear and no legislature no parliament is worth a rush or can secure the respect of those whom it governs unless it has that power which it is proposed to be given to us under mr gladstone bill hear hear i have shown you that in some respects the irish settlement proposed by mr gladstone does not give a parliament with powers possessed by grattan parliament but on the other hand that as regards our own exclusively domestic business it gives larger powers more important powers more valuable powers for ireland itself than grattan parliament possessed hear hear therefore we think that this settlement proposed by mr gladstone will prove a more durable settlement than the restitution of grattan parliament or the repeal of the union would prove cheers now there is one point which it is very important that you should bear in your minds and carry away with you and that point is that imperial unity does not necessitate or require unity of parliaments cheers will you carry away with you and remember it because it is the keystone of our whole proceedings you have an example in your own colonies you have ever so many colonial legislatures and yet you have imperial unity there is no demand no fear of separation from the colonies although each one of them has an independent legislature so far as their own business is concerned take again the example of the united states of america there are legislatures in the united states each of them with more power than it is proposed to give to the irish legislature hear hear and yet there is no danger of the separation of one state from another or of the separation of all of the states from the central federal government which corresponds to the imperial authority in this country hear hear and you would have if you gave us this settlement and if separation were ever attempted in ireland as it was attempted by some of the states of the american union some years ago you would have that moral power to put down that separation which the people of america possessed and used successfully and which you have not now in your dealings with ireland well then so far as the united states are concerned separation of legislatures has brought about federal union and not only brought it about but has maintained it so far as your colonies are concerned separation of legislatures has brought about imperial unity at a time when imperial unity was in danger when a rebellion existed in canada you quenched that rebellion by giving a separate legislature to canada and you have continued on these lines from that day to this so that not only have separate colonial legislatures not brought about separation but they have prevented separation but really people of portsmouth this talk about separation is the hollowest and most absurd talk that was ever given utterance to cheers the men who raised this bogey this bugbear of separation before your eyes as a reason against conceding the just demands of the irish people know perfectly well that there is not the slightest danger or risk of separation how can ireland separate from england according to these loyal and patriotic unionists out of five millions of the irish people two millions are what they call loyal if they are loyal how can the remaining three millions even if you give mr gladstone settlement bring about separation not only against the two millions but against the millions of great britain cheers the thing is preposterous and absurd from beginning to end and it is an appeal to cowardice cheers it would be the verist cowardice for the great british people with dominions upon which the sun never sets to fear to do justice to a small people few in number like the irish merely on account of this ridiculous cry but then finding that the talk about separation does not hold water another cry is got up about the danger of the protestant minority i think some of their speakers go so far as to say that the lives and limbs of some of the protestant minority are in danger under the present state of affairs laughter as in belfast the other day when some orangemen began wrecking the houses of the catholics hisses and shame and came into collision with the police they found they were in danger but why were they in danger it was because they broke the law nobody in ireland who observes the law under the new order of things will find that they are in danger of either life or limb hear hear there are protestants in ireland of all denominations including those who have no religion at all i am a protestant myself cheers i know them very well i believe from experience that the truth of the matter about the feeling of the protestant minority is this that the great majority of them do not feel very strongly upon the question one way or the other they would rather i think of the two that things were left as they are but certainly they have no fear of the catholics of ireland there is a small minority of protestants strongly in favour of mr gladstone settlement cheers and there is another small minority of protestants of orangemen in the north of ireland who are strongly opposed to mr gladstone settlement hisses that is how the matter stands it is this small minority who are strongly opposed to mr gladstone settlement who have raised this question about the protestant minority who are strongly opposed to mr gladstone settlement who have raised this question about the protestant minority and they ask you either to reject the bill altogether or else to insert provisions in the bill which will give special protection to what they call the protestant minority well i do not see how their claim is to be successful unless you reject the bill altogether i do not see how you can insert any other provisions than those which already exist in the bill in the shape of the first order for the protection of the protestant minority cheers under the system of the first order it would be possible for the protestant minority to hang up any bill they objected to for three years before it could possibly pass into law and before the end of that three years if the irish legislature passed enactments oppressive to the protestants of ireland it would be possible for the imperial parliament to intervene and take away the settlement it would have given cheers if the irish legislature did pass enactments in the slightest degree oppressive of the protestants of ireland i should say that ireland would justly deserve to lose her privilege hear hear but the difficulties about protecting the protestant minority in any other way than those already existing in the bill are enormous one proposal was that there should be a separate legislature for ulster now a separate legislature for ulster would leave outside ulster without the protection of that legislature and only protestants within the province could possibly get that protection hear hear but in addition to this the nationalists are in a majority in the province of ulster cheers they have returned the majority of ulster members and will return them again cheers the result of the establishment of a separate legislature for ulster would be that the first the only and the last act that would be passed by that legislature would be one united itself with the rest of ireland cheers so that as you will see ulster cannot be protected as they want to have her protected by the establishment of a separate legislature they have seen themselves i speak of the opponents of the bill the fallacy of this and they now claim that the north east corner of ulster shall be protected i do not know whether there is light enough in this hall for you to see what i wish to show you but the map is one that represents ireland and this little yellow patch covered by my forefinger represents protestant ulster cheers and they say now that they want a separate parliament for this little yellow patch up in the north east laughter but the majority of the irish protestants live outside this little yellow patch only five twelfths of the protestants live inside it and the other seven twelfths live outside it so that it is these five twelfths who live inside this north east corner who want to have a legislature set up for themselves and to leave the majority of their fellow countrymen unprotected to us outside hear hear it would be like the garrison of a city which finding itself hardly beleaguered sought refuge within the citadel and left the rest of the population of the city to be massacred so you see take it as you will you will not protect them as they want you will not protect the minority in ireland by giving them a separate legislature for ulster unless you reject the bill altogether there is no way in which you can effectually yield to the wishes of the small minority of protestants i am very sorry for having detained you so long cries of go on for i am afraid that it has been impossible for me to make my voice heard to any but a very small proportion of this enormous meeting the largest indoor meeting i have ever addressed in my life cheers and a voice how about lord carnarvon but i should like to consider with you for a moment what are the alternatives to mr gladstone plan that offer of settlement cries of none there is one other alternative there is the alternative of coercion hisses coercion continued as lord salisbury has claimed groans for years well it has gone on for years already and things are not any better and you are not any nearer to the end of the irish question cries of we are so far as coercion is concerned it has not brought you any nearer to the end of the irish question but what sort of coercion must it be it must be all the acts of coercion that you ever employed against ireland rolled into one and sternly employed as lord salisbury has said for years groans but you must have a very good understanding with lord salisbury that when he gets into office he does not forget all about this talk about coercion laughter it is a great mistake to suppose that the coercion which has been used for ireland has been used against criminals and against the breakers of the law one great fault in english coercion of ireland has been that no matter what your intentions have been when you had commenced coercion you have never discriminated between political agitation and between the breaking up of the law hear hear ministers have got coercion acts from parliament as the late mr forster some hisses and cheers got his coercion act namely on the promise that they should only be used against cattle maimers and against doers of evil deeds and of violence but what did mr forster do he used it against his political opponents and against none other and as a proof of that i would remind you that the men who were arrested and kept many of them for months in prison without trial hardly two dozen of them were ever put upon their trial or accused of any offence cries of shame the cast majority of them were arrested for open speaking and for nothing else that has always been the experience of english coercion acts in ireland you pass them with the honest intention of using them only against the breakers of the law but excitement and political passion arise and under the influence of excitement an political passion no statesman however eminent is to be trusted to use exceptional laws these laws have always been abused and they always will be abused well you will have to go further in ireland than you have ever gone before i am not one of those who believe that you cannot put down political agitation for a time by years coercion as lord salisbury proposes to use it groans i believe that you can put down political agitation you can silence us in ireland by our silence in the house of commons and the only way in which coercion against political opponents which is after all what is really intended and really meant can be successful even for a time will be by the disenfranchisement of ireland and her exclusion from the english constitution cries of never well i do not know if lord salisbury is returned to power never and if he sticks to his guns two pretty big ifs if he is returned to power and if he keeps his promises cheers and laughter the tories did not keep their promises to us loud cheers and that is why i think that possibly they will not keep their promises against us i said there was only one alternative but i was wrong there is another alternative and that one is that if lord salisbury gets into power he will make lord carnarvon his lord lieutenant again and we will get a better bill than mr gladstone's cheers and cries of expose him no i am not going to tell you anything more about it than i have told you already you see we may be wanting to make a little treaty with these gentlemen by and by again and it does not do to split too much against your old pals laughter now without telling you all about it i just want to point out one thing that neither lord carnarvon nor lord salisbury has denied the two main features of my assertion cheers what was that assertion it was that when i made a speech at wicklow about protection and the statutory legislature i had reason to believe that if the conservatives got into power after the general election they would have given us a statutory legislature well now i had every reason to believe that and they do not deny it cheers what they deny is something else which i did not say at all laughter and a voice that is their policy sir m hicks beach hisses and groans and lord carnarvon say that the cabinet did not agree to give us a statutory legislature but what i said was this that lord carnarvon came to ireland and left everybody with whom he spoke on the question under the impression that he himself and more than one of his leading colleagues were determined to give ireland a statutory legislature traitor and cheers that has not been denied no no and it cannot be denied lord carnarvon will not deny that he was as strong a home ruler as i was last august cheers and that when he went over to ireland he became so stronger and stronger every day he lived in the country laughter there is another thing he has not denied he has not denied that he sought an interview with me in order to speak to me and consult with me about a constitution for ireland hear hear so without telling anything more about it loud cries of go on i think that i have proved what has not been denied and will not be denied and cannot be denied that lord carnarvon was strongly in favour last year of a statutory legislature for ireland cheers but lord salisbury was only too anxious to be convinced and lord carnarvon as lord lieutenant of ireland strongly urged this concession on the cabinet and it was not refused by the cabinet until two things had happened one of these was the failure to give the tories a majority at the polls hear hear and the other was the rumour from hawarden that mr gladstone was going to offer a settlement cheers then lord carnarvon resigned his seat and he behaved honourably cheers and the rest of the cabinet ministers behaved dishonourably for they turned right about face hear hear they saw that up to that moment during their five months tenure of office they had been only too anxious to give ireland a legislature because it would be good policy for them so to do they saw afterwards that it would be a better policy to turn right round and denounce mr gladstone as the betrayer of his country and the disrupter of the empire hear hear and three cheers for gladstone now you see there is another alternative besides the alternative of coercion though of course it comes to the same thing because if you allow yourselves to be bamboozled into giving the tories another chance of making a treaty with us it will be found that it will be made next time so that they will not be able to break it cheers no men of portsmouth i believe that summoned to the battle by your great leader mr gladstone loud cheers you will recognize the urgency of this question cheers it is not given to men every day to do so right and so good a thing as justice to a sister nation cheers what harm could poor little ireland do to great and rich england if you were to concede her ten times as much as this cheers it is only mr gladstone desire to conciliate prejudices that has made this settlement as small as it is but small as it is we cheerfully accept it as a final one cheers we will not take upon ourselves the responsibility of keeping open this dispute between the two nations cheers untold is the guilt of that man who for party purposes does not take advantage of the spirit that is abroad among the english to put together the hand of the irish nation and that of england to close the strife of centuries a strife that has been of no good no advantage to the people of either country a strife that has only been for the benefit of the money grabbing landlords hisses a strife that has impeded popular progress in england as well as in ireland and that must continue to impede it a strife which is fanned for the purpose of cheating you out of your right and to divert the energies of the newly enfranchised masses of great britain from the redress of their grievances for the odious desire of oppressing and keeping down the small sister country shame i believe as one man you will indignantly repudiate these deceivers hear hear that you will tell them that you are not to be led astray by lying tales which it is sought to thrust into your ears and that you see now before you like a star in the night the great principle of asserting that ireland shall govern herself as she is entitled to do cheers while she does not seek to interfere in any matter which can imperil the imperial crown and dynasty of england she is determined as generations of irishmen have been before and as generations of irishmen should need arise will be again to have this justice conceded to her and with that determination she confidently appeals to the generosity and to the spirit of justice of the english people loud cheers mr parnels sic who was once more received with enthusiastic cheers said i just wish to say a word and only a word in appreciation not only of your kind vote of thanks but also for the way in which you have listened to what i had to say to you this evening i should have liked in my speech to night to have spoken to you on many things in greater detail than i have been able to do in the case of so gigantic a meeting as this but it was really impossible for me in consequence of the enormous mass here assembled to go further into detail than i have done cheers i believe that the irish people when they hear that i have been received in the way i have been to night by an english meeting of this vast extent will think that the millennium has come cheers and laughter i hope and i confidently believe that as the result of the great election now about to take place in portsmouth and all over the rest of the country a happy day of prosperity will opened to the irish people such as they have never before enjoyed loud cheers mr parnell concluded amid enthusiastic cheering which was continued with the singing of he a jolly good fellow for several minutes after he had sat down\n",

      "mr parnell who on rising was again greeted with prolonged cheers said that now when the goal seemed to be drawing near and the hour of final conflict and as they believed of decisive victory appeared near at hand cheers he was glad to find his fellow countrymen in liverpool extended to him such a greeting as he had experienced cheers the irish people constituted an important factor in each of the divisions of liverpool and he believed they would hold aloof from all english political parties as irish members in the house of commons did and give their votes apart from local and personal considerations cheers he was there to ask them to do this a voice we will and to regard themselves solely as irishmen upon whom a great trust and a solemn responsibility rested a greater trust than had rested upon irishmen at any time in her past history he also believed that in recognizing that responsibility the irish people of liverpool would be equal to the emergency and do their duty to ireland cheers in one of the divisions of liverpool the irish seemed so far as had yet been gathered to be in a position to return a candidate of their own cheers inquiries had not yet proceeded to a definite and conclusive point with regard to the relative strength of parties beyond the scotland division in the case of the scotland division they were convinced that they had ample strength to beat both the two great political parties and it had been decided with his approbation to offer for their acceptance that night mr thomas p o'connor as the candidate for the division cheers and a voice what about dandy pat and disorder they were convinced that mr o'connor from his services and his signal ability was well qualified and able to carry their flag to victory in the scotland division and that he would poll every irish elector who was able to vote cheers in sending mr o'connor from ireland to liverpool they regarded him as a loss but they recognized that the irish in england were under difficulties greater than those they had to gave in ireland and that consequently it was their duty to offer the ablest and best man for the special and important services he would undertake in standing for the scotland division cheers there was for a short while before the public and before the irish electors another candidate namely mr patrick byrne hooting that gentleman had left the question of his candidature for the scotland division entirely in his hands and had expressed his great unwillingness to be any party to divide the national flag cheers and a voice he a hypocrite in the interests of the same unity he advised mr byrne to withdraw his candidature in favour of mr o'connor and mr byrne had commissioned him that night to say that he unreservedly withdrew his candidature cheers with regard to the other divisions of liverpool exchange abercromby west toxteth and kirkdale the irish vote was very strong and he could not absolutely say for certain whether in any one of them they were sufficiently strong to beat both the other contending parties but their inquiries were still proceeding and they hoped to have figures which would be conclusive one way or the other before them in a few days until then they did not consider it desirable to replace the vacancy which had been created by mr justin mccarthy forced removal to fight the city of derry with regard to his withdrawal from the candidature for the exchange division of liverpool that was forced upon them by the necessities of the situation they would all readily admit that the capture of derry would be if they succeeded in taking it and he believed they would cheers one of the most glorious events in their history it was thought that only two men of the irish parliamentary party could win derry one of them was mr sexton cheers the other was mr justin mccarthy mr sexton was asked to stand for the western division of belfast and it was represented to him that only mr sexton could succeed there so that they were in this predicament that if they wanted to capture one of the divisions of belfast orange belfast and to take derry they would have to do it with sexton and justin mccarthy they therefore detailed mr sexton for the duty in belfast and they were obliged very reluctantly to ask mr mccarthy to give his services in derry and in the same way he asked them that night to ratify mr mccarthy withdrawal from liverpool they did not propose to nominate or suggest for nomination any candidate for the exchange or any other division of this city until they saw exactly how they stood in each and when they had the information before them which would be materially strengthened by the school board elections they would be in a much better position to advise them as to what was best to be done passing to the general questions of the day mr parnell said that since he last had an opportunity of speaking upon the national question they had had two very important utterances from english ministers regarding it they had the utterances of lord hartington hisses a few days ago at belfast and they had reported that day the great speech of mr gladstone in scotland on the same subject he had already dealt elsewhere with the marquis of hartington speech on irish affairs but he could not help contrasting the very great difference between the tone and the attitude of those two statesmen the marquis of hartington appeared to him to approach the question with his mind embittered against ireland determined if he possibly could to prevent a settlement between the two nations mr gladstone on the other hand with that breadth of statesmanship for which his name was renowned had approached the question of irish government in an entirely different spirit hear hear undoubtedly the speech of mr gladstone although in many respects vague and unsatisfactory was the most important pronouncement upon the irish national question which had ever been delivered by any english minister but having said so much he mr parnell feared that he could not say anything more in terms of unqualified praise because he thought the speech seemed to fall short of the exigencies of the position hear hear mr gladstone commenced by impressing upon his hearers with that extraordinary wealth of language of which he was possessed the importance of the irish question above all other questions and in that perhaps he alone of all english politicians appeared to discern the truth cheers the irish question undoubtedly was the most important question for consideration at the present moment by english politicians cheers until the irish question was disposed of it would be utterly impossible for any english questions to proceed loud cheers therefore mr gladstone showed a true and a keen appreciation of the importance of the question when he impressed it upon his hearers but he afterwards seemed to take up a rather inconsistent position because he said the question was such an important one having regard to the maintenance of the supremacy of the crown and the authority of parliament in all matters appertaining to that supremacy that when the demands of ireland were presented to a new parliament it would be the duty of whatever government was in power and of parliament to give them the most serious consideration in another word mr gladstone declined or appeared to decline to make any proposition of his own to the electors of the kingdom with regard to the settlement of this question he mr parnell was speaking entirely from a practical point of view when he said that it appeared to him that if they took mr gladstone at his word voted for his candidates and gave him a large majority independent of the irish party which he claimed to be necessary for any english ministry before it could consider the irish national question they would find themselves in this position they would present their claims for consideration to mr gladstone and if he agreed with them he would probably bring in a bill which after passing the house of commons would go up to the lords who would say to mr gladstone you never submitted the principles or the details of the bill to the judgment of the electors at the general election and we consider it is right in a question of such enormous gravity as this of the national relations between england and ireland that the electors of england and scotland should have an opportunity of passing judgment upon it and we will throw out this bill and compel you to dissolve parliament hear hear that would be a very abortive result of the general election but under the circumstances it appeared to him that the house of lords would only be carrying out their constitutional right by rejecting a bill the details of which had not been before the country at the general election cheers mr gladstone could avoid all this trouble by simply bringing his great intellect to the promoting of a constitutional course there was no living man better able to do it and he mr parnell invited him with all seriousness to lay his views as to the largest amount of self government for ireland subject to the conditions and limitations which he had stipulated for regarding the supremacy of the crown and the maintenance of the unity of the empire before the public in order that the electors of the three kingdoms might have an opportunity of judging of them and passing a decisive verdict at the general election loud cheers he wished to notice a very infamous falsehood he did not exactly like to call it a falsehood but he would say a very glaring misstatement which appeared in the times of that day he should not have noticed the matter were it not that considerable injustice was inflicted by the statement in the shape of a letter from mr saunderson a north of ireland orangeman hisses upon a gentleman whom he believed to be perfectly innocent of the offence for which he was now serving penal servitude he referred to mr p nally who some days ago at the mayo convention was brought forward by a considerable section of the nationalists of the county mayo as a parliamentary representative of one of the divisions of mayo in his position as chairman of the convention and also leader he was obliged to refuse mr nall candidature which he did with very great reluctance because he believed him to be innocent and also because his friends had a very strong conviction that if he were returned for mayo it might have a beneficial effect in obtaining his release he was obliged to reject his candidature and his friends after a good humoured discussion finally withdrew his name and in referring to this at a public meeting afterwards he took occasion to say what he thought of mr nally and of his conviction and imprisonment the letter of mr saunderson in the times referred to his speech of another nally the celebrated or rather the notorious scrab nally quite a different man and an entirely different character in every respect they could see the abominable unfairness of writing to the times and making a deliberate misstatement for he would not call it a falsehood because he did not know whether this mr saunderson really knew that he was telling a lie and making a deliberate misstatement with regard to a person whose release they were attempting to obtain surely some caution might have been observed by the writer of the letter to ascertain whether mr patrick nally had ever made a speech like the one quoted he knew that mr patrick nally never made anything but the most moderate speeches during the course of the land league movement and that no single passage of any of his speeches could be picked out which could by any possibility be interpreted or twisted into any incitement to crime or violence the speech quoted in the times and commented on in a leader as an argument against the concession of the national rights of ireland was made by another nally altogether surely where important issues not only with regard to the fate of an individual but the relations between two nations are at stake public journals in the position of the times should hesitate for a moment before inserting every lie as gospel which was sent to them cheers at the commencement of his remarks he said they were near victory and he believed they could fulfil two conditions the first was that they should keep their people at home and abroad united and free from quarrels and dissensions among themselves that this united people should be true to the great traditions which they had inherited and that as it rested in their power to strike to day what they believed would be a successful and lasting blow for ireland they would not shrink from striking hard and striking home loud cheers the second condition was that those who were intrusted to bear their flag in the parliament of westminster should be men who would sink all personal considerations and maintain the same union in their ranks that the parliamentary party of ever maintained during the last parliament that they should crush down with an iron hand all dissensions in their midst cheers and above all that they should believe in themselves and in the work they had in hand if these two conditions were fulfilled and they had a determined body of men who believed in the right of ireland to obtain self government then the day would not be far off when they the irish people of liverpool living as they were in another country would have the gratification of witnessing the assembling of an irish parliament on irish soil with full power to guide the destinies of their nation great cheering\n",

      "mr parnell m p said i cannot describe to you the pleasure and the gratification which it gives me to be once more amongst you in liverpool applause you have many times gathered together in your thousands in this and other halls in this city for the purpose of cheering and sustaining me in the days gone by in the difficult work which we had in hand and now as the goal seems to be drawing near when the hour of conflict and as we believe of decisive victory is at hand i am glad to find my countrymen in liverpool extending to me such a greeting as i have experienced and do not think the less of me after so many years absence from them applause you are met together to consider a very grave and very important question the question of how your votes shall be given in the approaching contests for the divisions of liverpool cheers the irish people in liverpool constitute an important factor in each and all of these divisions and i believe that recognising that truth they will hold themselves aloof from all english political parties hear just as your irish members in the house of commons do and that you will give your votes apart from all local and personal considerations hear hear on the side on which it may seem that you may most advantage the cause of ireland applause that is what i am here to ask you to do that you should refrain from joining any english political party in liverpool hear hear a voice so we will cheers mr parnell and that you should yourselves solely as irishmen upon whom a great trust and solemn responsibility rests at this moment a greater trust i do not hesitate to say than has ever rested upon irishmen at any time in their past history hear hear and i believe that recognising that responsibility you the irish people of liverpool will upon this as upon every other emergency in your history be equal to the occasion and that you will do your duty by ireland cheers the irish vote i have said that the irish vote is an important factor in each of the divisions of liverpool in more than one of these divisions we seem as far as we have yet been able to gather materials to be in a position to return candidates of our own applause as members of the irish parliamentary party hear hear our inquiries however have not proceeded to a definite and conclusive point as yet with regard to the relative strength of the party beyond the scotland division in the case of the scotland division we are convinced we have ample strength enough to beat both the two great english political parties applause and it has been decided by my colleagues with my full consent and approbation to offer for your acceptance to night mr thomas power o'connor as a candidate loud and prolonged cheering we are convinced that this gentleman from his services his record and his signal ability is one who is well qualified and well able to carry your flag in the scotland division to victory cheers and that he will poll every irish elector who is able to come to vote cheers it is unnecessary for me to talk to you about mr o'connor he has been my colleague for five years in the house of commons and i have never found a more faithful friend or an abler comrade to fight by my side in the thick of the battle cheers in sending him over from ireland to you we regret his loss but we recognise that you in england contend under difficulties superior to those which we have now to face in ireland and that consequently it is our duty to offer to you the ablest and the best man we can find in the country for the special and the important services that he will undertake when he stands for the scotland division hear hear we have followed out in this practice which we have pursued with regard to difficult constituencies in the north of ireland the ablest men of the of the irish party have in every case been sent to fight the difficult northern constituencies cheers and in the same way we send mr o'connor over to england to wage war in the enemy camp applause and we are confident that he will wage a most successful war too applause now gentlemen there was for a short while before the public and before the irish electors another candidate mr patrick byrne groans and applause with reference to this division and mr byrne left the question of his candidature entirely in my hands cheers and expressed to me in terms the absolute sincerity of which i do not in the slightest degree doubt his great unwillingness to be any party to dividing the national strength cheers i ventured in the interest of that same unity to advise mr byrne to withdraw his candidature in favour of mr o'connor and he has commissioned me to night to say that he does unreservedly withdraw his candidature cheers i think that mr byrne has acted most properly in this matter laughter and applause he has followed the example which has been set him in many parts of ireland at the various conventions which have been held where candidates who have come forward finding that they had not the support of the majority and that their continued candidature was likely to prove a danger to the national strength consented to forego their claims and retired in favour of those who were selected one must therefore appreciate this action of mr byrne as fitting and worthy of the occasion applause now with regard to the other divisions of liverpool the exchange abercromy west toxteth and kirkdale divisions in all these four divisions the irish vote is very strong i can't absolutely say for certain whether in any one of them we are sufficiently strong to beat both the other two parties combined but our inquiries are still proceeding and we hope to have figures which will be conclusive one way or the other before us in a few days until then we do not consider it desirable to replace the vacancy which has been created by mr mccarthy forced removal to fight the city of derry the selection for ulster i may explain with regard to mr justin mccarthy withdrawal from candidature of the exchange division of liverpool that this was a matter forced upon him by the necessities of the situation you will all readily admit that the capture of derry if we succeed in taking it and i believe we shall succeed loud applause will be one of the most glorious events in our country cheers it was thought that only two men of the irish parliamentary party could win derry one of these was mr sexton applause and the other mr justin mccarthy cheers whose name has been previously mentioned for the exchange division of liverpool and who indeed had i understand consented to stand for that division mr sexton was asked to stand for the western division of belfast and it was represented to him and to us at the same time that only he could succeed in this division of belfast so we were in this predicament that if we wanted to capture one of the divisions of belfast orange belfast cheers and if we wanted to take derry that we would have to do it with sexton and mccarthy loud cheers we therefore detailed mr sexton for that duty in belfast and we were obliged very reluctantly to ask mr mccarthy to give us his services in derry and in the same way i ask you to night to ratify mr mccarthy withdrawal from your town and to forgive us for what undoubtedly was the very short notice we gave you when taking him away from your service in the exchange division cheers we do not propose to nominate or suggest for your nomination any candidate for the exchange or any other of the three divisions of liverpool until we see exactly how we stand in each of these divisions and shall have the figures which are now being collected and the collection of which will be very materially assisted by the school board elections which are now going on a laugh we shall then be in a very much better position to advise you as to what is best to be done with the other four divisions and meanwhile with regard to these four divisions a resolution will be submitted to you pledging you who are electers sic of those four divisions to hold yourselves entirely aloof from the english parties and to refrain from pledging yourselves to either whig or tory until we have an opportunity of going amongst you again and consulting with you further in reference to the matter applause challenge to mr gladstone i shall now pass from the local questions of elections to the general questions of the day which are of such surpassing interest to irishmen all the world over at the present moment since i last had an opportunity of speaking to you upon the national question we have had two very important utterances from english ministers regarding it we had the utterance of lord hartington groans a few days ago at belfast and we have reported to day the great speech of mr gladstone in scotland on the same subject some hisses and cries of order i have already dealt elsewhere with the marquis of hartington speech upon irish affairs hear hear but i can't help contrasting the very great difference between the tone and the attitude of these two statesmen the marquis of hartington appears to me to have approached the subject with a mind embittered against ireland hear hear and determined if he possible can to do what he can to prevent a settlement between the two nations hear hear mr gladstone on the other hand with that breadth of statesmanship for which his name is renowned has approached the question of irish autonomy of irish self government in an entirely different spirit hear hear undoubtedly the speech of mr gladstone although in many respects vague and unsatisfactory is the most important pronouncement upon the irish national question which has ever been delivered by any english minister hear hear but having said so much i fear that i cannot say anything more in terms of unqualified praise because i think that from the practical point of view from his own point of view for his speech was or professed to be entirely a speech of a practical nature upon the irish question from a practical point of view that speech seemed to me to fail entirely and to fall very short of the exigencies of the position mr gladstone commenced by impressing upon his hearers with that extraordinary wealth of language of which he is a possessor the importance of the irish question above all other question and in that he alone perhaps of english statesmen and english politicians at the present moment appears to discern the truth the irish question gentlemen is undoubtedly the most important question for consideration at the present moment by english politicians until the irish question is disposed of it will be utterly impossible i was going to say for progress to be made but if i was to make use of any expression like that i suppose i should be accused of threatening obstruction laughter and applause and i wish to guard myself at the outset against being supposed to have even the idea of a threat loud laughter much less any threat of obstruction but from the nature of things it is impossible until that great irish national question is put to rest and finally settled it is impossible for english questions to find room or to proceed laughter and loud cheers well then i say that mr gladstone showed a true and keep appreciation of the importance of the question appreciation of sic pressed it upon his hearers but he seemed to me in his speech afterwards to take up rather an inconsistent position because he said that question was such an important one that when the demands of ireland having regard to the supremacy of the crown and the authority of parliament were presented to the new parliament it would be the duty of whatever government was in power and of parliament to give them the most serious consideration in other words he proposes to decline to make any proposition of his own to the electors of the kingdom at the general election with regard to the settlement of this question now i am speaking entirely from a practical point of view when i say that it appears to me that if we take mr gladstone at his word and if the irish electors of england take him at his word and vote for his candidates at the next general election and give him the large majority independent of the irish party which he claims to be necessary for any english minister before he can consider the irish national question that we should find ourselves in this position we should present our claims for the consideration of mr gladstone with his large majority if mr gladstone agreed to them he would probably bring in a bill to carry them into law and that bill would after passing the house of commons go up to the house of lords and the house of lords would say to mr gladstone well you never submitted the principles of this bill or the details of this bill to the judgment of the electorate at the general election and we consider that it right on a question of such gravity as is this question of the settlement of national relations between england and ireland we consider it right that the electorate of england and scotland should have an opportunity of passing judgment upon the matter and we will throw out this bill and compel you to dissolve parliament now that would be a very abortive result of this great general election and the return of mr gladstone to power at the head of a large liberal majority if in the event of his acceptance of our propositions when we have brought them forward in the new parliament and the passage of a bill based on them through the house of commons it were to be found that the whole thing was going to be knocked on the head by the house of lords and under these circumstances it appears to me that the house of lords would be only carrying out their constitutional right by rejecting such a bill a bill the details of which had not been before the country at the general election now mr gladstone could avoid all this risk and all this useless trouble by simply bending his great intellect to the task of framing a constitution for ireland there is no man better able to do it hear hear no living man better able to do it and i invite him with all seriousness to lay his views as to the largest amount of self government subject to the conditions and limitations he has provided which he has stipulated for regarding the supremacy of the crown and the maintenance of the union of the empire i would invite him to lay his ideas upon the question before the public in order that the public of the three kingdoms may have an opportunity of judging and of passing a decisive verdict at the general election which is approaching upon them loud cheers a lie nailed now i wish to notice a very infamous falsehood well i don't exactly like to call it a falsehood because i am not in a position to judge and i have not sufficient evidence before me to know whether it was a premeditated falsehood or not but a very glaring misstatement which appeared in to day london times hisses i should not have noticed the matter were it not that considerable injustice is inflicted by the statement in the shape of a letter from mr saunderson a north of ireland orangeman groans upon a gentleman whom i believe to be perfectly innocent of the offence for which he is now suffering penal servitude i refer to mr patrick nally applause some days ago at the mayo convention a considerable section of the nationalists of the county mayo brought forward mr patrick nally as a candidate for the parliamentary representation of one of the divisions of mayo and in my position as chairman of the convention and also leader of the movement loud cheers i was obliged to refuse mr nally candidature which i did with very great regret because as i have already said i believe him to be perfectly innocent of the offence for which he was convicted and also because his friends had a very strong conviction that if he was returned for mayo it might have a beneficial effect in obtaining his release however i was obliged to object to his candidature and his friends after a great deal of good humoured discussion withdrew his name and in referring to this at the public meeting afterwards i took occasion to say what i thought of mr nally and of his conviction and of his imprisonment just as i have spoken to you to night well this letter of mr saunderson which appeared this morning in the times referred to my speech about mr nally and gave a quotation from a speech from another nally the celebrated or rather notorious scrab much laughter quite a different character in every respect hear hear well you can see the abominable unfairness of writing to the times and making a deliberate misstatement i won't call it a falsehood because i don't know whether this mr saunderson really knew that he was telling a lie or not of making a deliberate misstatement with regard to a prisoner whose release we are attempting to obtain applause surely some caution might have been observed by the writer of the letter to ascertain whether mr patrick nally had ever made a speech anything like the one quoted now i know that mr patrick nally never made anything by the most moderate speeches during the course of the land league movement and that no single passage of any of his speeches could be pointed out which could by any possibility be connected or twisted into any incitement to crime or violence of any kind whatever the speech which was quoted in the times this morning and which was commented on on sic in the leader of the times as an argument against the concession of the national rights of ireland was a speech which was made by another nally altogether and it just shows you some of the difficulties that we have to contend with i do not know whether the times knew that there was no foundation for this accusation against mr nally i do not know whether mr saunderson knew but surely where important issues not only regarding the fate of an individual but the relations between two nations are at stake applause public journalists in the position of the times should hesitate before they insert every lie as gospel which is sent to them loud cheers at the commencement of my remarks i said that i believed we were near victory i believe that we are near victory provided we can fulfil two conditions and these two conditions are firstly that we can keep our people at home and abroad united and free from quarrels and dissensions amongst themselves loud cheers that this united people should be true to the great traditions which they have inherited and as it rests in their power to strike to day what we believe will be a successful and a last blow for ireland cheers that they will not shrink from striking hard and striking home renewed cheering secondly we require that those who are entrusted to bear our flag in the parliament of westminster shall be men who shall sink all personal considerations who shall maintain the same union in their ranks that we the parliamentary party of have maintained during the last parliament hear hear that they shall crush down with an iron hand all dissension in their midst applause and above all that they shall believe in themselves and in the work that they have in hand applause and gentlemen if these two conditions are fulfilled if we have a united people and a determined body of men believing in their work showing by every act by every thought by every word that they believe in the right of ireland to obtain national self government then the day will not be very far off when you living as you are in another country will have the gratification of witnessing the assembly of an irish parliament on irish soil loud cheers with full power to guide and watch over the destinies of our nation continued

      "mr parnell turned to judge gildersleeve and said judge and ladies and gentlemen i have to thank you in the first place for the cordiality of your reception and in the second place to regret that the grand cause which i stand here to plead for to night was no intrusted to better hands but ladies and gentlemen i fear not for this cause it is so great in itself that it can safely be entrusted even to so feeble hands as my own at this point the audience cheered the speaker and hear hear was shouted in all parts of the great building the american people mr parnell said occupy to day a proud position they are virtually the arbiters of this irish question the american nation has been made so by the common consent of all nations i rejoice said mr parnell that an influential paper of this city has taken up the cause of the land owners of ireland a storm of hisses which lasted fully five minutes greeted this statement there is no occasion to hiss the paper in question said mr parnell when the excitement had subsided it has done our cause more good than it could have done by advocating it openly i rejoice that a man of the great ability of mr kavanagh has been put forward to make the best defense possible for the irish land owners and that the british aristocracy was forced to come to democratic america to find a paper to advocate its claims to the life blood of ireland peasantry the object of mr parnell in visiting this country was he said twofold originally he proposed only to address americans on the subject of the political organization which he represented and to solicit money for the purpose of furthering the aims of that organization but before he was ready to sail the famine came in ireland and he determined to ask for relief for the suffering poor as well as to apply for funds to sustain the political organization which it is hoped will ultimately effect the regeneration of ireland the funds for these purposes will be kept distinct and each person contributing can designate to which fund he wishes his money applied it had been suggested by the paper before referred to that the speaker should devote himself entirely to collected funds for the relief of the starving peasantry of ireland but the cause of the present distress was in the unequal and artificial tenure of land which prevails we want said mr parnell to relieve the people but we also want to sweep away the bad system which has led to the distress america has always come forward with unexampled liberality to relieve distress in ireland but all the charity of america cannot permanently relieve us we must shame the british government into doing us justice we don't want to come to you in the guise of mendicants every year the american people must not forget that our great point is to reach the british government by means of an open discussion of the irish land question before the nations of the earth the irish people now present a remarkable spectacle with death literally staring them in the face they stand within the law and the constitution of great britain we have saved lives of the landlords and we have saved the lives of the people the speaker continued that it would be impossible for him in the face of this numerous multitude to go into many details on this occasion he could only speak very generally in reference to many branches of this great question if asked what do you propose he would say generally that he proposed to make the cultivators of the soil its owners cheers he wished to do this he said with as little injury to what might be considered the vested interests as possible no physical violence no unconstitutional action was contemplated or was in his judgment necessary renewed cheers as he had repeatedly said american public opinion was one of their greatest weapons more cheers and the landlords themselves by invoking that public opinion had shown the very high value that they placed upon it cheers he felt that it was a great compliment to the american people that the proud british aristocracy should humble itself and appear as a suppliant before this great democracy loud cheers and he continued they have put forward a gentleman mr kavanagh a man of signal ability to plead their cause he would do him the justice to say that he had been the very best advocate that circumstances admitted that gentleman had a variety of objections to their plans he had told the public that the system of ownership would entail subdivision and sub letting he had pointed to the old history of ireland before the famine where subdivision and subletting did proceed to a very great and the speaker thought to an evil extent as the proof of the justness of his assertion but the condition of affairs which they sought to establish was very different from that which obtained before the famine before the famine the system of renting the system of renting the land was usually in force that system necessitated subdivision and subletting now they contemplated replacing that system by one of sale they desired to make land free so that everybody who had money to buy might buy as much as he needed of it loud cheers under the system of renting it was impossible to sell the difficulty of proving title was so great under the present laws that in the case of small holdings the cost of proving title exceeded very frequently the purchase value of the holding itself then as now the laws of entail and settlement were in full force they desired to abolish the laws of entail and settlement cheers and cries of hear hear which prevented the natural crumbling of their properties which a wise nature had ordained to prevent the property of the world from passing into a few hands they wanted a local registration of land title such as they had here in america so as to make it as easy to sell and buy land as to sell a hay stack or a bale of cotton cheers then as regards subdivision that was also produced by the system of letting he contended that no injurious subdivision would take place if they had a free system of selling land in ireland he believed that under such a system the size of the farms would be regulated by natural causes that a man would not care to buy a farm which was too large for profitable cultivation and in that way the size of irish farms by natural causes would immediately become suited to the method of cultivation and the crops grown mr parnell then remarked that he was told by mr kavanagh of the example of the lease in perpetuity of their farms to tenants with the result that they would pass into the hands of lot men if you select an estate in ireland and sell the farms to tenants to morrow if you leave the laws of entail and settlement as they now are if you render it impossible for a man to sell a small bit of land except at a cost which exceeds the purchase price then in the course of a generation or two you would undoubtedly have the farms all back in the hands of lot men and landlords they desired to have the laws changed so as to be suitable to the condition they contemplated he pointed to the laws of france and belgium for the very best examples of the truth of his reasoning and of the proposition he laid before them cheers this gentlemen sic kavanagh then proceeds to make certain statements or rather misstatements of a rather barefaced character it was a common saying in legal circles over in ireland if you have a bad cause abuse the plaintiff attorney and so he supposed mr kavanagh thought that the best thing he could do was to abuse him since he knew his cause was hopeless cheers he did not intend to follow mr kavanagh bad example in that respect he intended to treat him with the utmost courtesy and consideration and he hoped if possible to induce him to come before them again to give him an opportunity of replying to him again kavanagh tells us he said that i proposed to apply the money raised in america to buying out landlords he kavanagh need not be in the slightest degree uneasy for he could assure him that not one cent of their money would every go into his pockets laughter and cheers then kavanagh went on to say that none of it would go to the relief of the distressed irish and that he parnell proposed to organize an armed rebellion renewed laughter and cheers he said that he had no doubt that many of his fellow countrymen in america would like to organize an armed rebellion cheers but he regretted to disappoint them also cheers because he must honestly tell them however unpopular such a statement might be that not one cent of the money contributed and handed to him would ever go to organize any armed rebellion in ireland great applause kavanagh goes on to say that a large majority of the land was let at a fair value and he cited himself and his estate as an example of this fact he had remarked that he did not intend to abuse mr kavanagh but he was bound to admit that during the high prices of the last few years kavanagh estate was let at a fair value although he regretted to say that he like some other irish landlords had refused to grant the reasonable reduction of rents necessary to be in proportion to the extraordinary fall in prices caused in part by american competition cheers the fact that mr kavanagh land was rented out at a fair value during the last few years would not excuse the many rack renting irish landlords who had taken the last pound of flesh and the last drop of blood loud cheers he knew too well that a majority of irish land was rented high and that a very large proportion of it was rack rented until mr kavanagh proved by statistics that this was not the case they could not be expected to believe a negative under such evidence there was another point where he wished to put one landlord testimony against another he would choose the estate of an absentee landlord of a class as a rule who did not rack rent their lands he wished to adduce the testimony of a man of mr kavanagh own class and proclivities mr parnell then cited the testimony of mr stewart trench of an estate in county monaghan which in brought in a rental of per annum to day that same estate brought in an annual rental of per annum the added value he claimed had been all the work of the tenants and not at all the work of the landlord nothing that the landlord has done has added one penny to the value of this property the landlord was now in receipt of per annum for a property which years ago brought which had all been brought about by the exertions of those poor people who worked upon the land mr trench he said admitted that this was done by the exertions of the tenants and not by the acts of the landlords for the population had increased to souls this was a process which had been going on in every estate in ireland the example he had chosen was not a better landlord than a majority of irish landlords and yet you see said he that during this period the rent roll of this estate had been rolled up to this enormous amount entirely through the industry of these tenants in concluding his remarks as he said to give his honorable friend mr dillon an opportunity of addressing the audience mr parnell used these words i can only in conclusion express my conviction that the time has come when victory is bound to crown the exertions of the irish people in their great struggle for liberty loud cheers the handwriting has appeared upon the wall renewed cheers and cries of hear hear efforts have been made time after time to misdirect public opinion and bolster up an unjust system i confidently look forward to the time when the tiller of the soil in ireland as in many other countries shall reap the benefit of his toil cheers and hand that result down to his children i look forward to the time when instead of proscribing labor instead of offering an inducement to the tiller of the land to allow it to remain idle and barren the great exertions which our people have shown themselves capable of when opportunity offered and when they were allowed to work for themselves and not be as slaves will be spent upon their own farms then i believe that one great step toward the freedom of ireland will have been accomplished loud cheers then we shall have put the last nail in the coffin of the system of english misrule in ireland cheers and have removed one of the great impediments to the union of all classes and of all religions there renewed cheers and that we shall have the dreams of every irish patriot in all ages realized cheers and that the orange and the green will be united enthusiastic cheers and the protestant and the catholic shall be enabled to work together for the good of their country tremendous cheers and that no codes will exist to prevent any of our countrymen from doing their duty upon the land which has given them birth prolonged cheering\n",

      "mr chairman ladies and gentlemen i trust you will excuse me if i make my observations to night very brief indeed because i regret to say that i am suffering from a severe cold there are also other reasons why i should not trespass much upon your time because there are several distinguished men on this platform who are well entitled to speak upon the question before us and whom you will hear with greater pleasure than you will hear me cries of no no no now we have assembled here to night for perhaps the noblest of all objects to extend help to a suffering people the help the assistance of the people of america to those who are starving in ireland it is being extended silently and without publicity in many different ways i heard yesterday from a gentleman who is connected with one of the principal banks of new york that during the last twelve months he had remitted and chiefly to the poorest people in the west of ireland the sum of from their relatives in this country that is applause he told me also that the proportion of these remittances had been largely increased during the past five weeks so that you see the relatives and friends in this country of persons who are suffering in ireland are already coming forward and are relieving them in that way also throughout the whole union relief movements have been set on foot in almost every city of the united states organisations i am glad to say have been started for the purpose of joining in this movement and we have america as among the first of the nations to relieve irish distress applause for my part as one who knows only too well the terrible suffering that now exists in that country i wish to thank you here to night and the people of this great country for their spontaneous generosity i am glad to say that i have received a cheering telegram from ireland the news during the last few days had been looking very black but i have just received a cable from mr michael davitt applause it is dated at carraroe connemara county in the following terms i must explain to you before i repeat the telegram that carraroe is the place where the police had recently fired upon the people hisses and where one hundred and twenty four evictment processes had been placed in the hands of the sheriff officers for service the people were indignant at the threatened ejectments and they burned out and took the rifles from the police prolonged applause now this telegram that i have received from carraroe says the irish people have triumphed disturbances are over the people have triumphed the ejectment processes have been abandoned and the day for serving them has expired loud applause a voice we thank you for it mr parnell no i don't wish to claim any to credit for that result the credit belongs to the patient and brave people of connemara themselves applause and i think they are entitled to the thanks of the whole people of ireland for their courage and for the stand they have made on this the turning point of the irish campaign applause just as your forefathers at lexington are entitled to your thanks for what they did so i say the people of connemara are entitled to our thanks and to the thanks of ireland for the stand and i thank god successful stand that they have made on the present occasion applause now the irish land question is a very old question it is seven hundred years old various attempts have been made from time to time to bring it to a successful issue the landlords on their side have endeavored to solve it by sweeping the people out of the country the tenants on their side have endeavored to solve it in various ways by constitutional methods and by forcible methods but that question in ireland still remains unsolved it still remains engaging the situation of every person who desires to see a prosperous basis of living established in that country now this question could never have been settled if unusual advantages did not present themselves to us and in attempting to settle it we were chiefly guided by a desire to assist the natural forces that are now in operation in ireland and which are likely to lead to a successful issue so long as very high prices ruled for agricultural produce in ireland the tenantry were content to pay excessive rents but owing to the american competition the beef and mutton that you have been sending over in such plenty to england during the last year or two these prices have tumbled and the tenantry are placed to such a position that they can no longer venture to think of paying the demands upon them now a crisis is coming on in ireland similar to that which opened in in an organized attempt was made to direct the people and to show them how they might snatch safety out of the danger by which they were surrounded in or rather subsequently to the year a large quantity one third of the land in ireland came into the market if that land were now to come into the market the tenants could buy it upon very easy terms a very large number of the irish landed proprietors were ruined by the crisis of and they were obliged to sell their estates in the encumbered estates court now we are working with the object of course it is only a very small portion of our object but we are working among other things with the object of obtaining in the case of estates indecipherable to be sold to facilitate the purchase of those estates at a fair price by the occupying tenants if that had been done in the years following one third of the cultivated lands of ireland would be now owned by the tenants without any further need to pay but the opportunity was lost no attempt was made to take advantage of the indecipherable and consequently those lands which were sold were purchased by a class of men who had made money and who invested in these estates with the intention of obtaining as much interest on their investments as they possibly could these men raised the rents on the tenants in almost every case they proved themselves to be the most exacting of landlords far worse than the men who preceded them and instead of obtaining a partial settlement of the land question we had the evil of the situation intensified in a very extreme degree now we see that a very great many of the irish landlords are going to be ruined they cannot help it it is their own fault they have lived on their means and we don't consider that it is any part of our duty to bolster up such men by encouraging the tenants to pay them impossible rents applause what we have said to the irish tenantry is you must not pay a rent which the land has not earned this season you must go to your landlords and ask them for a regular statement and where this is not given you must refuse to pay any rent at all until your landlord comes to his senses and gives you an abatement applause now these are the recommendations we have made some of you will think me rather extreme but if they hadn't been made the people would have paid their rents as they paid them in and would have starved afterward we have advised them to claim a fair abatement and in the event of this abatement not being given we have recommended them to maintain a firm and determined attitude and the people of connemara have been the first to carry our lesson and teaching with practical effect applause well then what will follow i wish you to recollect that this is only a branch of the question it is only a portion of what we propose i propose only to tell you of this one branch to night because to go into the details of a question like the irish land question would be impossible in one single speech what will happen these landlords who have dipped their estates encumbered them and who have to pay large sums of money in interest every year cannot afford to give their tenants an abatement of rent they must rack rent their tenants and if the tenants are unable to pay these rack rents these landlords must be forced to sell in the encumbered estates court now the only result of such a thing as this must be that the tenants will now get an opportunity of buying their farms when these estates are sold up to the present time when these estates have been sold the landlords have refused to sell them to the tenants because they preferred to dispose of them to a single purchaser rather than to divide them up into a number of small lots and sell them to a great number of buyers it has been a matter of convenience with them to do this because it is more convenient to sell property to one man than to a great number of persons they have also acted from a statement which prevails among the owners of property in ireland and england vis a desire to keep up the feudal aristocracy by keeping the lands in the hands of large owners by preventing it from falling into the hands of large owners by preventing it from falling into the hands of small owners and they have therefore obstructed the attempts made by tenants to buy their farms now the land act of the bright clause of the land act of provides that the government may advance two thirds of the purchase money to the tenants to enable them to purchase their holdings when they are sold in court these clauses were proposed by john bright the eminent english reformer applause he proposed them as an experiment he believes with us that the land of the country ought to be owned by those who till it applause but he was in advance of his time that is eight or nine years ago and as he could only get the legislature to adopt his clauses as an experiment in this bill during the eight or nine years that these clauses have been in existence they have remained a dead letter because their operation has been obstructed by the landlords in the way that i have told you the tenants have not obtained an opportunity of taking advantage of the british clauses this continued up to the present year when estates were sold in ireland they were eagerly bid for by the neighbouring land owners who desired to add to their prestige and influence in their counties by increasing their slave interests and as a consequence the purchase prices of land in ireland appreciated very rapidly but as soon as the present movement commenced a very remarkable change took place no landlord is now willing to increase his interest in land and when an estate is to be put up for sale in the landed estates court the landlord is obliged to go down upon his knees to his tenants and ask them to buy it under the bright clauses applause so far then as we have worked in this direction we have produced this result that where estates are put into the market for sale voluntarily by the owners the tenants are now able to purchase them under the bright clause of the land act at a fair market price applause well ladies and gentlemen i think if we had only done this that we could claim that we had effected very good work but this is really only a small portion of our programme because we are determined never to rest satisfied until we have enabled every tenant in ireland where it is at all practicable or possible to become the owner in fee simple of his own farm applause how ownership is to be accomplished the means by which this can be accomplished are very various many plans have been proposed and the english liberal party is in sympathy with our project in this respect men like sir charles dilke mr chamberlain the member of manchester mr john bright mr mundella and advanced english reformers believe with us that the landlord system is an artificial system and that so long as it exists in the country so long will the soil be cultivated at a disadvantage they have assured us that they will help us in sweeping away this system consequently our prospects look very bright if we can succeed in keeping our people in ireland but a pinch is coming this winter and if we allow them to be swept away the opportunity now given for settling this question will be lost now ladies and gentlemen i said at the start that i did not wish to detain you and i must not allow myself to be carried away into the indecipherable of this land question i have simply desired to content myself with the statement of a portion of our case the ways and means that we have already for making a very large number of the tenant farmers of ireland owners of their own farms that portion of our undertaking is being worked out already land has been reduced enormously in value about forty per cent during the last six months and for the first time in the history of the question it is possible for the tenant farmers on such estates as come into the market to become the owners of their farms under the bright clause of the land act i will give you one example before i sit down to show you how the operation of working under these clauses has been obstructed by the owners of the land in only three years ago a very large property in ireland was put into the market called the harank estate a bid was made for it by an outsider a foreign landlord of seventy thousand points the tenants came in and offered seventy five thousand under the bright clause of the land act the other person came forward and offered eighty thousand pounds and the tenants again came forward and offered eighty one thousand the person who made the original offer would not increase his price but it was knocked down to him at eighty thousand pounds and those who offered the eighty one thousand were not given the preference this was because it was easier to sell the estate to one person than to sell it to a large number and of course it is perfectly natural that a man who is going to sell his property should desire to sell it with the least possible trouble and expense he would rather have his money even if it were somewhat less in a lump sum from one person than to wait for it from a large number and i believe that there were two or three hundred in this case well the tenants appealed against the decision of the landed estates court in this matter they said they were entitled to be declared the purchaser of this property and their appeal was allowed by the higher court but another appeal was taken by the person to whom the property had been knocked down and a still higher court decided in favor of him the tenants then took the case to the house of lords and they were beaten in the house of lords upon a technical point the farmers lost the opportunity of becoming owners of their farms they spent five or six thousand pounds in costs and are now many of them in the most extreme destitution well now by this movement we have brought things into such a shape that if the estate were to come into the market to morrow the owner of it would beg of his tenants to buy it and in all probability instead of getting eighty thousand pounds for it he would get either fifty or sixty thousand now you will have indecipherable from the drift of our remarks that our principal object in this matter is to make a settlement of this land question possible in order to obtain a settlement of any question in ireland from the imperial parliament you have to make it a burning question mr gladstone himself admitted the other day when speaking in mid lothian that it was not until a police constable had been shot at manchester in the discharge of his duty by the fenians and clerkenwell prison blown up that the irish church question came within the domain of practical english politics he admitted in that way that you have to direct english public opinion that you have to act upon it in some extraordinary and unusual way in order to obtain any consideration of the irish land question and this is only natural the english people have their own business to attend to they live in another country their affairs are not our affairs it is not natural to suppose that englishmen will turn aside from the consideration of their own domestic and political interests in order to interest themselves in any irish question we are in this unfortunate position that in ireland we are governed by a people who do not live in ireland who have no knowledge whatever of our affairs and who have no interest or inducement to make them acquire such a knowledge we are therefore in an exceptional position our difficulties are very great and you must therefore excuse us if in order to obtain a settlement we are obliged to make the stand we do applause this movement has been a constitutional one and has been carried on without violence on the part of the people but the english press has made vague assertions that landlords were being shot and cattle being mutilated but in no case have they ventured to bring forward any particular instance and it is a remarkable fact that during the whole agitation there has not been a single outrage of any consequence committed by the people and the only blood that has been shed is the blood of the peasants of connemara who were fired upon the other day by soldiers sent there by the landlords to aid the police applause a constitutional movement ladies and gentlemen this is a constitutional movement and we have a desire to retain it within the strict letter of the law we have told the people that they must retain an attitude of passive resistance and up to the present time they have maintained that attitude most cheerfully and we have assured them if they continue to do so their cause is won and their fortitude makes us hope we shall pass over this winter in safety and quiet and we have strong hopes without much bloodshed and without much suffering applause but let us not suppose that a great cause like this can be won without shedding a drop of blood but the whole tendency up to this time has been toward the restraining of useless suffering and as i said the other day we have saved the lives of the landlords and the lives of the people for if the people had been left to themselves as they were in then the landlordism was synonymous with evictions but up to the present time there have been no evictions i had the other day a letter from a gentleman who said that all he knew of the suffering in he had learned from the irish papers but he wished to thank the gentlemen engaged in the present land movement as he saw that while the papers of teemed with notices of evictions the papers of to day teemed with notices of reductions applause the people instead of being evicted have been in many cases successful in obtaining a very large reduction in their rent now we ask you to do your part in this great work we don't ask you to sent armed expeditions over to ireland a voice that is what we would like to do and applause i know that you would like to do that very much applause and right i think i know what you are going to say and what you would like to do and how willing you will be to help us all applause but we ask you to help us in preventing the people who have taken our advice and who are exhibiting an attitude of devotion which has never been surpassed what we ask you to do is to help us in preventing these people from being starved to death that you can do and while you are thus helping these people you will have the satisfaction of feeling that you are engaged in the noble work of charity and while you are doing that you will know that you are assisting in breaking down a system which has proved the ruin and destruction of ireland this is not a new enterprise this struggle has gone on for many centuries and it is bound to go on to the bitter end and in one way or another the irish people will insist upon having the land of ireland for themselves applause and the end of it will be that then the men who till the soil will also own it applause the high heart of our country remains unquelled the will and the courage of our race are unquenched and they are strengthened by the spectacle of the fine estate and by the great power of our people in this free land loud applause i feel confident that the day is very near at hand when we shall have struck the first blow the first vital blow at the land system as it now exists in ireland and when we shall have taken the first step to obtain for ireland that right to nationhood for which she has struggled so long and so well loud and continued applause\n",

      "mr parnell received the harp and expressing his sincere thanks added i will carry it back to my native county of wicklow where your ancestors the o'byrnes many years ago nobly fought for the freedom which was theirs by right i will cherish it as a harbinger of the success which is to attend the present efforts to ameliorate the condition of ireland address of mr parnell in opening the speaker expressed regret at the unavoidable absence of his colleague mr dillon who had been summoned to new york on business connected with their visit to this country and asked the generous indulgence of the audience for any of his shortcomings our mission to this country he said is two fold the appalling calamity of starvation is staring a quarter of a million of our people in the face and we are here to ask the people of america to assist in averting the danger and we also ask you to help break down that terrible system which has brought about this misery when we left england the government were unwilling to admit that there was famine either present or imminent in ireland but soon after our arrival in this country they awoke to a sense of the fact and began to acknowledge it of course you will send your contributions to relieve this distress for you began to send your offerings before we came but for the liberal aid sent by people in this country to their relatives abroad the distress would have been much greater it would be difficult for us to tell how far it will extend but we do not believe that it will be equal to the famine of in seven of the irish counties it will probably be equal to the famine of that year these counties represent a quarter of a million people in need of help and who will in a few weeks be without bread and there is much suffering among the small farmers all over the country we cannot assist them all but our desire is to send aid at once where it is most needed we have predicted this distress for eight months and have warned the tenant farmers to ward it of by withholding unjust rents from the landlords we have authority for believing that in seven counties in ireland half a million of people will suffer from a famine equal in severity to that of and the succeeding years in a month or six weeks they will be without bread or any means of subsistence in all ireland except in the extreme north great depression prevails but outside of these seven counties people will be able to exist they can procure one meal a day of coarse food america cannot relieve the whole of ireland let us then devote our charitable efforts to these particularly afflicted districts if we can hold out for a month we can perhaps we can do something towards shaming the english government into its duties if you will send what you can you will have done a good work for ireland and you can prevent much loss of life by sending help promptly the ten millions of irish people in this country will not let their fellow countrymen die of hunger there is plenty of food and cheap food in ireland but the people have no money to buy in former times much time had been lost in sending food but now money to purchase food can be cabled and reach mayo sligo or tipperary in five seconds arrangements have been made to have relief tickets honored by merchants in the needy districts and the most necessitous can be relieved at once it is unnecessary for me to explain the irish land question to an audience of irishmen or to say that the distress in that country is caused by the bad system of land tenure the landlords say it is not the fault of the system or its administration but the people are lazy there are too many of them and they ought to emigrate well if that is so and emigration is a cure ireland should to day be one of the most prosperous of countries mr parnell next read extracts from a letter by lord dunraven which was published a week previously in the new york herald each mention of which journal elicited hisses and groans in dissecting the letter the speaker figuratively handled the english lord without gloves and his comments on the different sentences were humorously sarcastic and provoked much laughter at the expense of the titled gentleman in question the speaker also made a few scathing allusions to a mr kavanagh who had got a letter into print on the subject as seen from the landlord side previous to the publication of lord dunraven's continuing the speaker referred to the case of prussia where in the king decreed that all tenants should be allowed to take as their own the land they occupied by paying an indemnity that landlords and tenants should have two years to agree upon terms and if it was not amicably settled by that time the state should do it he explained the system adopted and pointed out how a similar system would benefit ireland it is practically the taking by the government of all the land at a valuation and paying for it bonds or cash and allowing the tenants to repay the government by instalments extending over a period of thirty five years he said he would prefer to see the freedom of the tenants accomplished at once but except by violent revolutions this was impossible the change must be gradual it would be cheaper than a revolution and england could better afford to pay in settling the land question than in quelling an insurrection i am confident said he that the suffering people will receive your sympathy i believe the public sympathy of this country is in our favor and i am proud of the success already recorded i believe the heart of america is sound towards us and that we shall receive both moral and material aid in settling this great question although you cannot give us your physical aid you can give us money and strengthened public opinion which will compel england to do us justice applause i appeal to you ladies and gentlemen to do all in your power to aid this worthy and suffering people your ancestors here in america were prompt in assisting ireland in the hour of her need and you have that comforting reflection now i feel that it is not asking too much of you to do the same and you can have the proud privilege when our aim is accomplished to say that you contributed towards its realization\n",

      "i am happy to think that you have investigated the causes which have brought me to this city it would be useless for me to say that i am not worthy of the reception you have given me to night because of course it is evident that you have given it to the cause i represent the cause of a suffering and starving people i shall before proceeding to the main portion of my address endeavor to explain that we have changed somewhat from the original object for which we came to this country originally we came to this country for the purpose of enlisting your sympathy and support solely in behalf of our political movements in ireland but the immensity of the famine and the certainty that unless something is done very speedily in six or seven of the large counties in the west of ireland thousands will perish of the most horrible of all deaths famine so we have changed in obedience to the dictates of humanity and ask you to assist us in endeavoring to remove the distress in ireland now the irish land subject is a very complex question and it would be impossible for me or anybody else to treat of it of that whole question in a single speech i have since my arrival in this country examined this question from all points of view and we have placed before public opinion the object we have in view which is shortly to obtain for the tillers of the soil the sunshine of day in other words we desire to abolish the feudal land system which prevails in ireland it is a remarkable fact that no other country in europe save where british rule extends does the feudal system fully prevail the system in ireland originally was that of tribal under its regulations the chieftains of the tribes exercised a kind of sovereignty over the people who owned the land the people gave their services in the army and were prepared to defend the country in return for the occupation of the land the chiefs had no real ownership in the lands that were cultivated they belonged to the tribes according to the general system but when the english conquered ireland they brought this feudal land system in other words they took away the whole of the land from the people and they transferred it to the soldiers of fortune and others who had come over from england from time to time to assist them in their conquest of the country i may here observe that in doing this they laid the foundation of all the trouble that has been in ireland ever since after your civil war in this country you never thought of confiscating the land such an idea never entered your minds on the contrary you hastened to admit those with whom you had fought to the rights of citizenship you did not place those whom you had conquered under difficulties from which they could not recover nor did you curse them with a feudal land system recognizing therefore the feudal land system of ireland as the cause of all the misery we desire to abolish it and introduce some other system more humane more in accordance with justice and the pressing requirements of an industrious and oppressed people we are not seeking to introduce anything remarkably new for we have precedent for all we propose to do in changing that system which has been productive of so much injury we desire to abolish this feudal system of land tenure france abolished it by the revolution prussia abolished it by a system which i shall describe to you the system adopted by the king of prussia to enable tenants to hold land might be adopted to great advantage in ireland my object in coming amongst you is not to appeal to your passions but to give you as much information as i can with regard to the complex system of land tenure in ireland and to endeavor to remedy the evil applause the system of land tenure in prussia in was far better than the system in ireland the tenants in prussia had triple rights in the soil they had a system of tenant right which prevented intrusion intact and rendered it impossible to interfere with the occupation of the land but at the same time the system which gave the ownership to the classes which did not cultivate it awakened the king of prussia to devise at the conclusion of the war to make the tenants in prussia owners of the land in order to promote the peace and prosperity contentment and solidity of his kingdom the edict which the king of prussia made with the advice of his ministers is such a remarkable document that i shall trespass upon your time while i read the preamble to you we frederick william by the grace of god king of prussia having convinced ourselves by personal experience in our own domains and by that of many lords of the manors of the great advantages which have accrued both to the lord and to the peasant by the transformation of peasant holdings into property and the mutation of service and use into a fair indemnity and having consulted in regard to this weighty matter experienced farmers and skillful sic persons of all kinds belonging to our province and to all ranks of our subjects ordain and decree as follows amongst other things that all tenants of hereditary holdings whatever the size of the holding shall by the present edict become the owner of the holdings after paying to the landlord the indemnity fixed by this edict and lower down there is another clause which says we desire that the landlords and tenants should of themselves come to terms of agreement and give them two years to do so if within that time it is not done the state will undertake it the work was not done in two years the landlords and the tenants could not agree in the terms in which it should pass consequently the state stepped in and proceeded to make the transfer this way they established rent banks in all the different localities the laws for establishing banks provided the machinery for the wholesale redemption of the land and which was transferred to the tenant by this law and its instrumentality the state constituted itself a broker between landlord and tenant a bank established in each district was empowered to advance to the landlord a rent debenture by payment from per cent interest and the amount of the rent debenture advanced to each landlord was to be equal to years purchase what the state considered to be a fair rent the state undertook to vary the rent and it said to the landlord you will receive debenture or bonds amounting to years purchase of this rent these debentures will carry four per cent interest per annum until we redeem them now you will have observed that prussia was bankrupt they had just come out of a disastrous war without revenue or resources of any kind the state was not in a position to pay the landlord his money simply because they had no money or any credit to borrow the requisite sum consequently they offered to the landlord four per cent interest the tenant on the other hand had to repay the government for undertaking this obligation and this was the method by which it was paid the tenant was obliged to pay into the hands of the district tax collector each month a twelfth part of the rent calculated at five per cent of the capital sum issued in debentures and bonds to the landlord at the end of years the land became the property of the tenant without further charge you will observe that the position was this the landlords received debentures from the state in termination of their interest in the land the state paid the landlords four per cent per annum and the tenant paid the state five per cent for years upon the capital amount of this debenture in other words the state became the landlord now another principle has been adopted by the legislature in england with regard to this question of enabling the tenants to become the owners and we have been told that we were communists robbers of the irish landlords and that we were not worth the attention of this country i will explain to you the principle upon which the legislature of england has acted two acts of parliament provide for this one of these was the irish church act of the other the gladstone land act of the irish church as it is commonly called but rather the english church establishment in ireland was maintained by the rents of church members or tenants of land in ireland the state protected the life interest of these clergymen by making an annual payment during their life to take from the tenants who had become tenants of the state under the form called the irish church temporalities bill controlling property which was formerly managed by the church by the act of it was directed to sell all this land it was not considered a desirable thing that this land should continue to be the landlord or tenant for an indefinite time or that they should be in the ordinary sense of the word tenants at will the purchasing price arranged to be paid for this land was to be in this manner three fourths of it was to stand out for a period of years at a low rate of interest the principal was to be paid in installments sic during this period the remaining quarter was to be paid down by the tenants in cash of the tenants became the owners of their own farms paying one fourth in cash the remained being allowed to stand a period of or years i forget exactly and payable by installments sic well that was one of the ways in which the english recognized the desirability that tenants should become owners of the land that was done by mr gladstone under a liberal government great applause the other act was the land act of and john bright loud and continued cheers who is a firm believer in the principle that the land ought to be held by those who till it introduced into that act what were called the bright clauses by these clauses the state was empowered to advance to tenants desirous of purchasing of estates coming into the market voluntarily by the will of the landlords two thirds of the purchase money the tenant to find the remaining third himself the repayment of the two thirds to the state was spread over a period of years in installments sic of five per cent by the tenant to the state and at the end of years these payments were to cease principal and interest being discharged by them it is a remarkable fact that while the clauses of the church act which permitted tenants to purchase their holding succeeded in a remarkable manner out of having purchased their holdings the bright clauses remained practically a dead letter there is a reason for that in the operation of the bright clauses of the land act the landlords who were selling land obstructed their working with equal determination and to such an extent did that proceed that these bright clauses have remained almost inoperative during the nine years since the passing of that act the reason for the inoperation sic of the bright clauses was that the landlords had refused to sell to the tenants refused to break their estates up into small lots they have preferred to sell to large buyers instead of small ones the consequence has been that up to the present time a large number since have been unable to buy although willing to give more for farms than could be obtained from any other purchaser the land in england and ireland is handed down from generation to generation so that it remains unbroken and it is the desire of the owners to keep up the land system which enables them to maintain superiority through owning the land they have obstructed the tenants many times in their attempts to become owners these are the principles which the legislature of great britain under a liberal government followed i have already described the course in prussia and i ask you to say whether there is anything of communism in what i have said there is another reason why landlords arrested the movement the irish land as obtained that is to say the landlords interest in irish land has obtained a very fictitious value in recent years during the last eight or ten years owing to the great manufacturing prosperity in england the prices of beef and butter and other agricultural produce have advanced enormously the landlords took all benefit of this advantage and instead of sharing the advanced prices with their tenants have raised their rents you will have some idea of that when i say that the land of ireland is one the verge of per cent over the valuation the government have put upon it for paying price shame of course one of the results of our movement is to break this high price down the landlords made estimates at the commencement of the agitation as to the value of the land in ireland they value it at years purchase at a rental of per cent over the valuation of the government i would not value the landlords interest at more than years purchase upon the rental based upon the government valuation in other words it would reduce their interest into market value by something like ninety millions of pounds sterling of course it is natural the landlords should make a great struggle for owing to the land being put into the market in such large quantities the people of ireland get none of it but here again i would call your attention to the distress which exists i have pointed out the cause accounts as they continue to arrive show that distress is increasing even at what should be the glad holiday of the many partial starvation has commenced many in ireland only taste meat once in a year on christmas days and i regret to say that this christmas that custom was observed more in the breach than in the observance there were many thousands in mayo who had no meat even on christmas day and many of them could not even obtain meal we are charged with endeavoring to prevent the payment of rents that is not true in trying to faithfull represent the interests of the tenant farmers we bear in mind how they have been rack rented and in this time of terrible distress we want that some of the burden shall fall upon the landlords who have raised rents beyond the capabilities of tenants to pay is there communism in that loud applause we are perfectly willing in a case of this kind if landlords have not raised the rents that the fall in prices of agricultural produce should be fairly divided between the landlord and tenant i should be exceedingly sorry to utter any words of injustice between the landlord and his tenant i think we should strive to protect the interest of landlords who have let their lands at a fair rent as we endeavor to protect the interest of the tenants who have to pay rack rents well then it is now come to the question as to how much the landlords shall get whether they shall receive unfair rents in the presence of so much misery and suffering whether the small minority shall extort while the people starve or whether there shall be that even handed justice to which legislation in other european countries has pointed in relation to the ownership of the land and in the church temporalities bill and bright clauses of the land act in english parliament we feel that our efforts for the many are right we want the people to be benefitted by wise legislation to be rewarded for their labor we do not want the people to be driven away in short everybody admits except the landlords and they are hard to convince that they the landlords will have to go long and continued cheers the only point to decide is how they are to be got rid of in a fair manner that is the question but we feel strong in the belief that they will have to go and the land come into the possession of those who till it cheers the landlords admit that ireland is in a peculiar state both for themselves and the tenants they are candid and they kindly say the tenants ought to emigrate voice send them to england another voice send them out west if there was any choice and the people would receive them we might give them horace greely advice it is undoubtedly a very great compliment to our people to be told by the newspapers of this country that they are very anxious to have them here the american people say come over and we will give you land for nothing this is a great comfort to our people at home but i have not heard any such invitation from the landlords yet cheers on the contrary the new york herald hisses although anxious to give the landlords every opportunity for fair play does not invite them out here i think the most forcible commentary that can be made upon the irish land system is that a class of men educated and intelligent should be placed in position and power the irish landlords have occupied for a period of seven centuries and not be able to find anything better than extradition for the bone and sinew of ireland loud applause lord dunraven is a fair sample of the landlord class he addressed a long letter to the new york herald in which he recommends his feeble plan of emigration as a cure and he pitches into us irish people for not being willing to go he says there are two causes for the distress the want of capital continued increase of population and periodic times of famine he thinks emigration is the panacea for all the troubles of ireland but then even though he is a lord he may be mistaken cheers his lordship neglects to point out that the irish people do not govern themselves but are governed by the representatives of england which the irish people consider not only unfair but look upon as a disgrace would emigration cure the evils if emigration could have been any good to us in ireland we should have been the most prosperous nation on the face of the globe there has been more emigration from ireland than from any other european nation then he says we have given the irish tenants very poor advice not to pay their debts he calls it a patent parnell pill he says it is very deleterious in its consequences the very last advice i gave before leaving ireland to those present was to take all the money they had and pay their debts cheers in nine cases out of ten the tenant has not made enough for his family to live upon they tell the tenants to go and ask for an abatement for rent and the landlord refuses the abatement to people brought together we have given the advice that i have just told you and yet this lord is not ashamed to come before the american people and tell them a palpable lie he goes on to tell us that the proceedings of the parnellites are peculiar we propose that the settlement of the land question should be adopted which shall enable a tenant to hold his farm by paying rent to the government for a period of years we don't propose to pay lord dunraven all this we hold that they should hold the land they till and that no man should interfere with them in the efforts of their labor he further reviewed lord dunraven letter at length and then went on to say that the history of ireland has been one long continued struggle between the minority and the majority the minority have ruled the majority but the time is coming when the process should be reversed the time has come when if there has to be suffering it should be borne by the minority not by the majority we proclaim the right to govern ourselves we say that no government is constitutional except a government by the majority of the people of a country and that it is a systematic violation of that law which has led to all the trouble of ireland the minority have been settled down upon us and they have upheld their odious system when the majority have decided one way the minority have gone against it it is time that this rule should cease and that the same law which governs every civilized community should be had in ireland on this great principle the government must stand condemned we think the time will come when the british government will be as anxious to settle the question as the irish are themselves unless you act upon english public opinion by mere force make it inconvenient for them to do injustice we can never have a settlement there is only one way to show them that they must here mr parnell stamped his foot and there was great applause other methods have been tried various attempts have been made to show john bull that he must listen every attempt that has been made has been successful more or less although the time might have fallen in different periods gladstone attempted but not until a prison had been attacked at clerkenwell and the tragedy had occurred in manchester loud cheers we are not recommending a resort to physical force but in the troubles as years roll along it is impossible to say what may come if there is not some justice some redress for the wrongs of ireland we want to feel that we have our sympathy and aid for the people of ireland we want to feel as we go along in this agitation that you in this land sympathize in our endeavors we have to thank our sympathizing countrymen for the aid they have rendered and which we feel will still be rendered the people of the west of ireland are in a fearful condition they have had to endure a famine for three months and we have advised the tenants to keep their rents and save them for food for their children had it not been for this the famine would have commenced three months earlier and of them have been kept from starvation through the abatement of rent the famine instead of being confined to six or seven counties would have extended much farther we have therefore succeeded in two things in limiting the famine and postponing the date but the time has come when further postponement is not possible there is now no food left for people of that country we ask you in view of the facts to come to our assistance and help our people until we can shame the government into a sense of its duty i am sure that the people are very near starvation point there is distress and destruction all over ireland in most of the irish towns the laborers have only one meal a day consisting of course indian meal in omagh they have nothing left the testimony of bishops men of distinguished position and gentlemen of all ranks and classes of society of all political views tell us of the extent of the famine and ask you to come forward liberally with your sympathy and help in the removal of the causes it is useless to give charity unless you take some steps to put down the tyranny we think you ought to be proud of the opportunity given you to save a noble people they are too sic many of you kith and kindred and their present wants and future comforts should be well considered we wish to agitate in such a way that there may not arise the necessity for resort to force to accomplish the purpose which sarsfield enunciated on the field of limerick long and continued cheering i know after a lapse of two or three centuries we should take every opportunity afforded us for a settlement of this great question that we should break down the barriers between class and class in ireland and catholic of the south uniting with protestant of the north be united for one common purpose immense cheering it is possible to have the upper classes of ireland taking their position as leaders of the people as friends of the people when that comes and come it may we shall partly have realized the dream of true irishmen at all times during the history of the country which may yet been redeemed and you in this country may then look back with satisfaction to the part you have taken and bless your fortune that you have lived unto to day to assist us in the aim we have in view immense cheering which continued three or four minutes\n",

      "mr parnell was heartily received and expressed his thanks for the kind expressions and warm reception he had received at the hands of the citizens of lynn he apologized for not speaking at any great length but would be pleased to offer a few practical remarks he said that the present famine in ireland was not so serious as in but from the best information he could gather he was of the opinion that there would be starvation in some of the western counties before many weeks unless assistance was forthcoming the small farmers and laborers in old ireland are distressed they will not have enough to eat but they will have sufficient to enable them to support life until spring sets in in two or three weeks people will be without food and our duty is to send money where it is actually needed and allow those who can sustain life to shift for themselves the amount from america although large must be for temporary relief and we can send it forward in weekly instalments mr parnell then explained the land question and at the conclusion of his speech was heartily applauded the great leader speech mr parnell spoke as follows i feel exceedingly indebted for your kind reception and of course i understand and recognize it as due to the cause i represent and not to any personal merits of my own the land question is an old one dating from the conquest when ireland was conquered england brought her church and her land system he was glad to say that he had not to speak at the present time of the religious aspect there is now no religious inequality the feudal system was planted in an uncongenial soil of our country perhaps it would be well to describe very shortly what was the old system in ireland it was the tribal system which gave the soil to the people when that system was replaced the land was transferred to the conqueror as the spoil of conquest the feudal system was established so that property may be entailed upon unborn children to enable a privileged class to possess power the quantity of land in england and ireland is limited and the land owners have shaped the laws so that they may keep the property from generation to generation and hold it as a monopoly there are in ireland farmers who cultivate the soil and men who own it nine out of ten of those landlords live out of the country the rents leaving ireland amount to about paid by a small country whose wealth per capita is less than that of any other country if the cultivators of the soil in america were to pay out a year they would very soon find a way to remedy it this drainage however is only a very small portion of the grievance the climate is so good and the people so industrious that they would willingly pay it but they have a further trouble the system of tenure which prevents the people from making any outlay on their lands their charges against the landlords are that they have worked the system so badly that if the tenant wishes to improve his soil the landlord sees in that act an inducement to increase the rent to a point from which there is very little profit left to the tenant the system deals with a commodity of enormous value if the lands were held on proper conditions it would produce three times the amount of food it now produces it would produce three times the amount and professor baldwin an eminent authority on agriculture supports this view we are now endeavoring to improve the land system and the landlords do not like it the value of property in ireland has considerably decreased and this is done by american beef and other commodities sent to ireland and england we charge the irish landlords with maladministration the landlords of england have worked the system differently without waiting for agitation the english landlords decreased their rents we attempt to improve the condition of affairs and are called communists and lad robbers in france the revolution swept away the landlords without a penny compensation perhaps if the irish landlords do not heed the lessons another revolution may sweep them away in ireland the tenants propose to pay the government valuation and no more and taking that as a basis in twenty years they propose to pay twenty years purchase in annual instalments extending over thirty five years this is what the bright clauses contained mr parnell then described the bright clauses as at other meetings and read the edict of the king of prussia supporting such a settlement of the land question in that country the british legislature should now admit that the land system in ireland was a complete failure and should be compelled to see that the tenants become owners of the soil they have been told it would take to by the lands of ireland the lands have been considerably reduced and would now purchase them if the government cannot give the money let them give their obligations or console revolutions are often very costly remedies and a peaceful solution of the question would be better for landlord and tenant a peaceful solution should be offered they would have that independence which every man should have and then they could look forward as irishmen should if the land system is not improved the landlords will sooner or later feel it they are a defenceless people in ireland the right to carry arms is denied and that birthright of every freeman is punished in ireland with imprisonment for two years a large body of constabulary is employed with soldiers and the time may come when ireland will have a chance she is at war and beaten to her knees the idea of the irish nationalists may be realized in seven counties of the west there are thousands of men women and children who do not know if they will get a meal there is great destitution but it is not likely to reach the point of famine outside of these seven counties the funds started in ireland by the duchess of marlboro will be administered for political purposes and beware how you send any money to any fund in dublin unless you know all about it if the irish people are not broken down by physical suffering the victory will be theirs and they hope that they will live to remember that they helped their countrymen at home\n",

      "mr parnell said mr president gentlemen of the cork young ireland society ladies and gentlemen it was only in consultation yesterday with some of the leading members of this society that i decided upon the choice of subject which i have been announced to speak to you about this evening namely ireland and her parliaments cheers i have consequently had in the bustle and hurry of the numerous public engagements of the last day or two but little time to devote to adequate preparation of so important a subject as this i am therefore obliged to appeal to you in the commencement on account of my shortcomings and if i treat this great subject very inadequately as i know i shall be obliged to do you will i am sure excuse me and you will take the will for the deed i have thought it right to speak to you upon this question as the most suitable one because i think it is most desirable in the present aspect and with the present prospect of public affairs that the youth the young men and the young ireland of to day should have their minds directed to the parliamentary history and institutions of our country that by reference to this subject they should understand that ireland has had a parliamentary history that she has had many parliaments of different kinds some bad some indifferent and some good that consequently our claims to parliamentary government are ancient and well founded i have to say say sic to you this evening should induce any number of you to read the history of our country or turn your attention to the study of those books of reference to which you have access and of the doings of the constitution of the parliaments of ireland i shall at last have done some good service to the national cause applause the parliamentary system in ireland appears to have been introduced into ireland after the conquest of the country for english purposes under that system as it originally stood the power of granting supplies to the english king who also ruled ireland was vested in those parliaments they had also the power to make laws for the country it is remarkable that the occasions upon which the parliaments were summoned together in ireland were very few and far between in other words the english crown did without their supplies and contented themselves with the spoliation of the country and with the robbery of the land from her people and its settlement upon the english garrison and with attacks and confiscations and the obstruction of the privileges of the catholic clergy of this country the first parliament such as i have noticed appears to have been called in the reign of the henry viii on the 12th june during the course of the attempt at the conquest of the country for which that monarch reign was so remarkable this parliament was remarkable for the fact that a large number of irish chieftains for the first time recognised its position by sending representatives to its council chambers its proceedings however were of no advantage to the country it only aided the crown in its attempts at the conquest of the land the next irish parliament was called in the reign of elizabeth on the january and ten irish counties only were represented in it the remaining members being made up of those returned from boroughs created for the purpose and which were chiefly occupied by the english garrison they would observe however the crown was anxious to procure a parliament subservient to its purposes nine years later another parliament was summoned by sir henry sidney one of queen elizabeth deputies and this parliament was memorable above the others that preceded it for the unconstitutional and unscrupulous methods resorted to by the crown to obtain its subserviency this parliament in fact was a mere english faction the third elizabethan parliament was called by sir john perrott on the 26th april a strong irish party this appears to have been the first assembly to which a strong irish party was returned and it was remarkable for the strenuous opposition offered by that party against the english constitutional party in the reign of james another parliament was summoned in twenty seven years later you will see that the intervals between these parliament called in the way i have described composed of the english party the court party and returned by constituents in which the great majority of the people consisted of the english garrison the crown could not even trust that parliament called together to remain in session for a long period neither could they venture to call it together very often in order to secure that these parliaments should be subservient to england forty new boroughs were created right off a great contention them took place the irish party was very strong in this assembly and the great contention took place with regard to the election of a speaker the irish party were so strong that they succeeded in returning a speaker whereupon the english minority took the speaker of their own choice who had been beaten in the vote and voluntarily and by foce placed him in the lap of the speaker who had been elected to the chair by the irish party laughter in years later we hear of another parliament being summoned in which the court party were in a great majority the siege of derry now all the legislative assemblies all the parliaments which i have enumerated up to the present time were parliaments which had joined the english crown in persecuting the people acts of spoliation and confiscation were going on during all this period and so far as these parliaments did anything their acts consisted in the oppression and robbery of our people it was not until an english king james ii in driven out of his own kingdom by william of orange and his rebellious subjects sought refuge here that a free and independent and truly representative party was summoned owing to the exigencies of james for the first time it was during this parliament that the memorable siege of derry took place that parliament repealed the act of settlement which had been passed in the previous reign but james himself was thoroughly averse to the proceedings of the parliament on account of its freedom and its desire to undo the misdeeds of its predecessors applause ireland lost her independence in the reign of geo i ireland lost its independence owing to a dispute which arose between the irish house of lords of course the irish parliament consisted of a house of lords and a house of commons between the irish house of lords and the english house of lords on a question of appellate jurisdiction the irish house of lords was totally opposed to change and were undoubtedly right in their contention but the english house resolved not to allow itself to be beaten and they enacted a measure declaring that the king of england had power with the consent of the english parliament to make laws binding upon ireland and that the irish parliament had practically no representation whatever and so the irish parliament continued with power to do nothing except to vote supplies to the crown without power practically speaking to make laws for their own country without the previous consent of the english parliament resurgent so it continued until the reign of george iii when on the 27th of may applause the independence of the parliament of ireland was regained by the exertions of grattan and the volunteers of that period the parliament of grattan although there were many defects in its action and in its franchises yet undoubtedly had a constitution of a very sufficient character it had a constitution which would have enabled it to remedy all its own inherent defects in fact it had power over itself over its own formation and future as well as over the future of ireland it had power to vote or refuse to vote supplies to the english crown and it had power to make laws for ireland it had power to claim although it did not exert the power to claim that the ministers of the crown should be representative of the majority of the irish people taking all in all the history of that assembly consisting as it did only of a very small minority of the people namely the protestants of ireland was a noble and remarkable one hear hear the brief period of prosperity during the years of its existence ireland prospered and prospered by leaps and bounds and we have it on the testimony of lord clare that the progress of ireland in every material respect was most remarkable and there can be no doubt that if the destinies of the country had been left with that assembly if the constitution of had been maintained catholic emancipation would have been gained long before it was subsequently from the english parliament by o'connell applause it would have been also better for both the people and the owners of the land the landowners in ireland they would have been taught to conciliate the people towards them they would have learned to govern the people justly and uprightly and to give them by degrees those larger privileges the extension of the franchise to the masses of the people the right for all sections and religions to vote and take their places as members for constituencies which it has taken eighty four years of struggling to obtain hear hear i cannot doubt that much mischief would have been spared and that instead of occupying the humiliating position which the landlord class now do they would have a better and a happier one and as for the people their sufferings would have been largely mitigated our material resources would have been developed and increased our population would not have been banished from the country and we would be in a different position now from what we are in to day applause the green eyed monster but the great powers of the irish parliament of aroused the alarm of english statesmen and a determined attempt was set on foot to destroy its independence and rob ireland of her constitution and her parliamentary institutions by sapping the integrity of its members the means resorted to are a matter of history and you are all well acquainted with them namely the bribery and corruption amongst members representing the borough constituencies in the government the union in the legislative union between great britain and ireland was enacted by a vote of to members being absent it is very much to the credit of the minority of that they should have remained faithful but the discredit is great that must always attach to the representatives who basely surrendered the birthright of their country the legislative union as i say was enacted in and it has taken years to convince england that after all she has not made such a good bargain as she thought she would have made out of it applause she has disgraced herself in the eyes of the world by her misgovernment of this country hear hear and applause she has bungled and blundered beyond belief she has been cruel and vindictive to a point that would be incredible were it not a sad reality applause england failure but having every means and all means having tried the quarterings of the yeomanry and the pitch caps and triangles and the gibbets in cheers having tried her transportations and her penal servitude in cheers having tried her imprisonment and her penal servitude in loud cheers having tried her coercion in hisses she finds our people still unbroken cheers still presenting an united front to her misgovernment hear hear still determined and now in a position of more unconquerable force than ever to win back our lost rights cheers we stand on unapproachable ground no more and no less we are entitled to ask that that which has been stolen from us by means which nobody now seeks to defend for a moment shall be restored to us applause we might perhaps be unwise if we went further than that demand we should certainly be foolish if we asked for anything less loud cheers coming as i do amongst you in this year i can see no sign of a diminution in the determination of the people of cork to help in this great struggle applause on the contrary i find everywhere amongst all ranks and classes of society a great confidence belief and conviction in the success of our cause by remaining united by bearing with one another differences of opinion by refraining from straining at gnats and above all by the exercise of that courage and determination which has been the birthright of irishmen in all ages i believe that in the future we shall win our battle applause the new franchise the admission of the masses of the people to the franchise is a most important help it will be possible for them to say now for the first time beyond yea or nay what the real opinion of the irish people is upon this question cheers up to now there has been a fictitious representation of ireland the representatives of the people were in a minority and the representatives of the oligarchy were in the great majority the latter have had therefore an importance attached to their representations and claims which did not really belong to them and which they will be unable to find henceforward underlined when whigs and tories are practically stamped out when we have a united representation from ireland amounting to eighty five members it will be impossible for any people for any parliament even so intolerant and haughty an assembly as the english parliament and people long to withstand our claims underlined the greater ireland we have got helps we have a race greater than our own across the atlantic loud and prolonged applause it is no disparagement to you to say that there is a greater ireland in america we have a growing and an influential population in australia applause we have large contingents in england and in scotland with all these aids and all these helps surveying our position underlined i know that england has already in her own heart given upon the contest loud and continued applause underlined and that it only remains for you to be as determined and as true as your brothers and sisters in other parts of the world hear hear to enable us and you to gain that restitution which is our right and

thanking you for the honour which you have done my colleagues and myself in inviting us to meet this goodly company and i shall proceed though with some reluctance and great diffidence to face the consideration of the important toast which you have placed in my hands cheers the toast my lord mayor ladies and gentlemen of ireland a nation loud cheers it is one which recalls to our minds many recollections recollections of great men of a long and enduring struggle of many sufferings on the part of our people and of a survival to day of what is an irish nation cheers the survival of a people who have forced upon an unwilling opponent the recognition of an actual fact that ireland still lives cheers scotland has lost her nationality and has practically become merged in england but ireland has never done this cheers a voice and never will mr parnell and she never will cheers there are many reasons for this result reasons into which i do not propose to enter to night it is with facts with some accomplished facts we have to deal hear hear and with facts which we hope soon to see accomplished hear hear our right to nationhood our right to nationhood to day is practically undisputed hear hear in order that our people may be enabled to watch round the footsteps of our nation what is necessary it is necessary that we should exchange the dark terrible and suffering

is an impossibility that it is impossible for ireland to obtain the right of self government no no i believe that if it be sought to make it impossible for our country to obtain the right of administering her own affairs that we will make all other things impossible for those who so seek prolonged cheering during which a large body of those present rose to their feet and waved handkerchiefs and who is it that tells us these things are impossible it is the same man who said that local government for ireland was impossible without ample declarations on our part these statements come from the same lips as those that told us that equal electoral privileges that the concession of equal electoral privileges by england to ireland would be madness and we see that what was considered madness in the eyes of the man who now tells us that ireland right to self government is an impossibility has been now conceded without opposition and that self government which was then also denied to us from the same source is now offered to us the local self government then denied us from the same source is now offered to us by the same person with an humble entreaty that we may take it in order that we may educate ourselves for better things and further powers i do not propose however to dwell longer on this seeming impossibility there is nothing impossible to a united and determined country and for an honest representation of that country renewed applause of course lord hartington hisses doesn't enter into a consideration of the question with an evenly balanced mind he invites the other factions of which his party is composed the radicals the bradlaughites the local optionists mr healy m p the deceased wives sisters mr parnell the deceased wives sisters

wrestle with the young irish giant the shall be no legislation for england the lion and the lamb there is to be a kind of lion lying down with the lamb loud laughter there is to be absolute union between all english parties upon great and important home and imperial questions which will always engross their minds until they have squelshed sic us out laughter well gentlemen i am not much given to boasting hear hear and applause and i should be very unwilling to assume to myself the role italics of the prophet but i am obliged i suppose to night to give you my candid opinion upon this matter and it is this that if they have not succeeded in squelshing sic us during the last five years they are not likely to do it during the next five great cheering unless they brace themselves up to adopt one of two alternatives under the adoption of either one of which we should ultimately win and perhaps win a larger and greater share than we otherwise should the alternative underlined they will either have to grant to ireland the complete right to rule herself or they will have to take away from us the share the sham share in the english constitutional system which they extended to us at the union and govern us as a crown colony without any parliamentary representation whatever underlined applause the government of ireland suppose they adopt the second alternative will practically lead to the same thing as the adoption of the first one the government of ireland as a crown colony and it would be the government of a very large crown colony a much larger one than they possess or have attempted to govern from london up to the present would simply lead to the concession of a constitution similar to that which is enjoyed with the good will of england by each and all of the larger colonies and that is practically what we have been asking for ireland so that whether they chose directly to give us the right of self government in its fullest sense the right of national self government or whether they chose to govern us as a crown colony it will come to the same thing in the long run hear hear on the brink of victory i desire now to express my fullest conviction that the irish people are on the brink of victory in this struggle cheers there is nothing in the world humanly speaking that could prevent their success save immoderation on their own part hear hear i would entreat everybody every honest irishman to show that he and our country are worthy of self government hear we are far more likely to lose by attempting to do too much in the near future than we are likely to win by adopting such a course underlined outrage underlined i don't scarcely like to attach much importance to some recent events which have occurred down in the county of kerry and i will explain why i don't attach much importance to these events we have heard of houses being broken into one or two houses broken into and a recurrence of what was known in times past as moonlighting hear hear i don't attach too much importance to those occurrences for several reasons in the first place because the county of kerry has unhappily never at any time even during the height of the coercion act been free from such occurrences that kind of thing was always going on in that locality it is an especially impoverished district it is a district where the evils of landlordism magnified and intensified as they may have been in other parts of ireland have been reproduced to a most extraordinary extent it is a locality where it is scarcely possible for the people to live where they drag out a miserable existence and where practically speaking nothing but desperation and the impossibility of living drives them to such courses as these hear hear bad as has been the history of landlordism in these eastern districts of ireland it has been ten thousand times worse in such counties as kerry hear hear but i am bound my lord mayor and gentlemen in my position to express my conviction that such occurrences as these which have taken place in kerry recently are producing an enormous evil and mischief to the cause of irish nationality hear hear and applause transient as they may be confined to one particular locality as they may be i would ask the young men or the old men who may be taking part in such things if they be men within the reach of my voice if they be not the product of police management in ireland cheers if these actions be really undertaken by honest irishmen with the view to benefit their country i would ask them to pause to hearken to my voice applause to underlined such thought as those which spurred them into such actions are destructive so far as they can be destructive to the interest of our country and the life of our nation loud cheers underlined the other side and having said so much on one side i desire also to say something on the other side cheers this will be a very sore and cruel winter for the agricultural community it is a certainty that the land has undoubtedly not produced in any part of the country the rent which landlords are now seeking to exact hear hear there are many tenants who are able to pay their rents but they are able to pay their rents not out of any return of the soil during the last year but out of their frugal savings hear hear there are many others who are unable to pay their rents and who must lose their homes and the little property which they and their predecessors in title have created during many long struggles and years of toil if landlords are allowed by the government to assert their full right and if those full rights are asserted and if the tenants are not able to pay hear hear that was the leading principle of the old land league fight hear hear we pointed out that unless the tenants acted in a body unless those who were rich stood by those who were poor hear hear all in the long run must go down and the result was the land act of and the land purchase act of hear hear but we are now face to face with a situation in which forbearance is required and not alone upon one side but upon the other hear hear and applause if we are to urge moderation upon our people ought not the other side to set us an example applause or if they won't set us the example ought not they to follow our example hear hear and applause irish landlordism would appear to be almost an irretrievable plant it has had many chances but it has never been willing to take one the government have large forces of police and military at their disposal maintained at the cost of the british taxpayer to a very large extent are those forces to be used for the eviction of tenants during the coming winter months who are not able to pay their rents as well as for the eviction of those who are hear hear and no it is not now any longer a question of conspiracy or combination to refuse to pay rents hear hear that cannot be alleged as an excuse it is very easy to separate the wheat from the chaff it is very easy for those in authority to decide who are able to pay and who are not hear hear all we ask is that our people shall not be banished from their country applause the people must be kept at home we cannot hope to maintain a nation without maintaining our people and if the slow and silent process of extermination is to go on we are bound to take our stand by the side of our people loud cheers so then while i preach and while i hope all of you coming as you do from many different localities in ireland will each in your own station preach moderation so i think that we ought to expect moderation from the other side hear hear discrimination is easy under the present circumstances but we should be untrue to our suffering fellow countrymen if we did not endeavour to do what in us lay to shield the helpless tiller of the soil from extermination and from banishment during the coming winter hear and cheers the outlook in all other respects is hopeful for ireland but undoubtedly the great depression of prices the agricultural depression introduces a new and very great difficulty it will be for irish landlordism to show of what it is made during the coming winter hear hear and if it exacts its full pound of flesh i am confident that the result will be that landlordism will be left with very little flesh to exact in the future cheers and for the rest gentlemen outside the land question which is the real question of ireland at present outside that great question let us hope and i am sure you all hope with me and that you feel the same confidence that i do that our nation surviving her long trial and her terrible sufferings will join the other nations of the earth in that march towards prosperity and towards freedom which we all hope for her and are determined to secure for her enthusiastic plaudits again and again renewed mr parnell mr parnell said he desired now to trespass somewhat on the order of the proceedings to ask them to drink the health of the lord mayor applause they had been reminded that night of the time when the corporation of dublin had refused the freedom of the city to mr john dillon and himself and they had also been reminded that the freedom was refused by the casting vote of the lord mayor it was a great and an enormous change which had enabled them to meet there to night after a short interval of four years on the invitation of the lord mayor to witness as they hoped and believed under such auspices the commencement of a new era for ireland they had gone through in these five years suffering danger doubt and uncertainty the citizens of dublin had chased from their midst every element of unsoundness and the lord mayor was enabled to night for the first time to entertain himself and his colleagues the irish party of and applause he hoped he did not claim too much when he said that this occasion would be a historic one he might rest the fame of his colleagues upon what had already happened applause if they did not even anticipate a near and a greater future it was only he who worked amongst that party in times of difficulty and trouble who had seen the energy and the belief with which they had attacked every angle and knot and cord which enchained their nation it was only a man who could feel what he could not express what a debt was due from ireland to that parliamentary party applause and he was glad that standing there that night on the second place of dignity in the country the highest and the first being worthily filled by the lord mayor it had fallen to his lost under such auspices to express his sense of what the country owed and what he owed to that party in his task of aiding his country in her work of regeneration applause he had to thank the lord mayor for inviting his colleagues and himself to the magnificent banquet to meet the wealth the talent and the courage of the country applause he begged to give them the health of the lord mayor\n",

      "the wicklow convention weekly freeman october mr parnell in replying said i am glad to have an opportunity at this impromptu meeting of expressing my thanks to the national league of this town for the very kind address which they have presented to me and i shall also express to you the great satisfaction and the great encouragement which the proceedings at the convention to day afforded to my colleagues and to myself at a convention of this country attended by of the clergy of the county and elected delegates from all parts of the county the candidature of mr corbet your tried representative cheers and of mr garrett byrne cheers who won his spurs in the service of the great neighbouring county of wexford the candidature of these two gentlemen was unanimously adopted without a single note of dissension or disunion therefore i think i am entitled to congratulate you and myself upon the proceedings of our convention and to trust that they will serve as a model to the rest of ireland cheers in the very important series of meetings which will shortly be held for the purpose of fulfilling a similar duty to that which has been so satisfactorily and so patriotically discharged to day by your delegates cheers of the merits of your candidates it is unnecessary for me to speak you have known mr corbet for so many years you have known him as your representative and you join with us in declaring that no more trusted no abler no more satisfactory member ever entered the halls of the british house of commons to represent an irish constituency cheers we his colleagues can testify to his merits merits which have been demonstrated to us over and over again upon many trying occasions whenever we have called upon him we have never found him wanting and we have been taught by the experience of the last five years to look upon mr corbet as a man who will be always at his post when duty requires his presence cheers as a man who will be always be foremost in maintaining the union and the integrity of the party and the voice of its majority and we have every confidence that in the future in the new parliament that is to come in the great crisis which we feel confident will result in the obtaining of our liberties he will continue to add to these constant proofs of his merits and his fidelity which he has already placed before us hear hear for mr garrett byrne your second selected candidate i have also to say that during three years of great trial until his health broke down we found him at his post constantly by day and night faithful amongst the most faithful cheers when renegades left us groans influenced by intimidation and by self seeking garrett byrne stood firm and he showed that he had in him the material of which his great ancestor the garrett byrne of ballymanus was possessed loud cheers we shall then welcome him back again to our ranks with love and with confidence that in him we shall again find a suitable upholder of the honour of our country of wicklow and of ireland cheers and now gentlemen having dealt with the proceedings of the convention to day i may perhaps be permitted to touch upon one or two matters of great public and general interest and importance at the present moment hear hear when i last spoke in public in ireland i expressed my conviction that in the new parliament we should be able to form our platform of a single plank and that plank the plank of legislative independence cheers and that we should carry that plank to a successful issue in the same way as during the last parliament we have carried other subordinate planks such as the extension of the franchise and so forth cheers underlined my declaration has been received by the english press and by some although not by all the english leaders with a storm of disapproval and they have told us that the yielding of an independent parliament to ireland is a matter of impossibility but nothing that has been said in this interval has in the slightest degree diminished my confidence in the near success of our efforts underlined loud cheers on the contrary very much that has been said by our enemies in reference to this claim of ours has very much increased my confidence cheers they practically admit that things cannot be allowed to go on as they are that it is impossible to keep an unwilling people and unwilling representatives in forced legislative connection with the other two kingdoms hear hear they admit that there must be some change but the two conditions that they put forward in regard to this change and as a condition of this change are firstly that the separation of ireland from england shall not be a consequence of the grant of legislative independence to ireland and in the second place they claim that we shall not be allowed to protect our manufactures at the cost of those of england now i shall deal very briefly with both of these points we have had mr gladstone the greatest of living english statesmen in the remarkable manifesto issued by him a week or two since declaring that he is willing to consider our demands provided the granting of them does not involve the first of these considerations namely the separation of ireland from england and we have had mr chamberlain on the other hand although not so distinguished a statesman as mr gladstone although not so able a man yet undoubtedly a very great force in the english liberal party declaring that he is willing to give us a legislative body of some kind provided it has not power to protect our manufactures against those of england to take the last point first and to deal with the question of the protection of irish manufactures i have claimed for ireland a parliament that shall have power to protect these irish manufactures cheers if it be the will of the parliament and of the irish people that they should be protected cheers but it is not for me to say beforehand what the action of such a freely elected irish assembly would be i may have my own opinion as to the best course for that assembly to take but i have claimed that no parliamentary assembly will work satisfactorily which has not free power over irish affairs applause which has not free power to raise a revenue for the purpose of government in ireland as shall seem fit and best to that assembly applause i am of the opinion an opinion that i had expressed before now that it would be wise to protect certain irish industries at all events for a time hear hear that it is impossible for us to make up for the loss of the start in the manufacturing race which we have experienced owing to adverse legislation in times past against irish industries by england unless we do protect these industries not many in number which are capable of thriving in ireland applause i am not of the opinion that it would be necessary for us to protect these industries very long possibly protection continued for two or three years would give us that start which we have lost owing to the nefarious legislative action of england in times past hear hear i think also that ireland could never be a manufacturing nation of such importance as to compete to any great extent with england i believe there are several industries which would thrive and could be made to thrive in ireland but i think that as regards many other branches of manufacture of which we have now to seek our supply from the english markets we should still have to go to their markets for supply on account of natural reasons which i have not time to enter into at the present moment but i claim this for ireland that if the irish parliament of the future considers that there are certain industries in ireland which could be benefited by protection and which could be placed in such a position as to enable them to compete with similar industries in other countries by a course of protection extending over a few years the parliament ought to have power to carry out that policy cheers it is not for me to predict the extent to which that power should be used but i tell english radicals and english liberals that it is useless for them to talk of their desire to do justice to ireland when from motives of selfishness they refused to repair that most manifest injustice of all namely the destruction of our manufactures by england in times past when they refused to repair that injustice by giving us the power which we think would be sufficient to enable us to build up these comparatively few industries which ireland is adapted by her circumstances to excel in applause i will proceed a little further and i will deal with the claim that has been put forward that some guarantee should be given that the granting of legislative powers to ireland should not lead to the separation of ireland from england this claim is one which at first sight may seem a fair one it may appear preposterous to ask england to concede to us an engine which we announced our intention of using to bring about either separation of the two countries or which we accepted silently with the intention of so using it but there is a great difference between having such an intention or announcing such an intention and giving counter guarantees against such an intention it is not possible for human intelligence to forecast the future in these matters but we can point to this we can point to the fact that under years of parliamentary connection with england ireland has become intensely disloyal and intensely disaffected applause that notwithstanding the whig policy of so called conciliation alternate conciliation and coercion and ameliorative measures that disaffection has broadened deepened and intensified from day to day cheers am i not then entitled to assume that one of the roots of this disaffection and feeling of disloyalty is the assumption by england of the management of our affairs cheers it is admitted that the present system can't go on and what are you going to put in its place cries of home rule my advice to english statesmen considering this question would be this trust the irish people altogether or trust them not at all cheers give with a full and open hand give our people the power to legislate upon all their domestic concerns and you may depend upon one thing that the desire for separation the means of winning separation at least will not be increased or intensified cheers whatever chance the english rulers may have of drawing to themselves the affection of the irish people lies in destroying the abominable system of legislative union between the two countries by conceding fully and freely to ireland the right to manage her own affairs it is impossible for us to give guarantees but we can point to the past we can show that the record of english rule is a constant series of steps from bad to worse cheers that the condition of english power is more insecure and more unstable at the present moment than it has ever been applause we can point to the example of other countries of austria and of hungary to the fact that hungary having been conceded self government became one of the strongest actors in the austrian empire we can show the powers that have been freely conceded to the colonies to the greater colonies including this very power to protect their own industries against and at the expense of those of england we can show that disaffection has disappeared in al the greater english colonies that while the irishman who foes to the united states of america carries with him a burning hatred of english rule cheers that while that burning hatred constantly lives in his heart never leaves him and is bequeathed to his children the irishman coming from the same village from the same parish and from the same townland equally maltreated cast out on the road by the relentless landlord who goes to one of the colonies of canada or one of the colonies of australia and finds there another and a different system of english rule to that which he has been accustomed to at home becomes to a great extent a loyal citizen and a strength and prop to the community amongst whom his lot has been cast that he forgets the little memories of his experience of england at home and that he no longer continues to look upon the name of england as a symbol of oppression and the badge of the misfortunes of his country cheers i say that it is possible and that is the duty of english statesmen at the present day to inquire and examine into those facts for themselves with their eyes open and to cease the impossible of going forward in the continued misgovernment of ireland and persisting in the government our people by a people outside herself who know not her real wants cheers and if these lessons be learned i am convinced that the english statesman who is great enough and who is powerful enough to carry out these teachings to enforce them on the acceptance of his countrymen to give to ireland full legislative independence full power to manage her own domestic concerns will be regarded in the future as one who has removed the greatest peril to the english empire hear hear a peril i firmly believe which if not removed will find some day perhaps not in our time some year perhaps not for many years to come but will certainly find sooner or later and it may be sooner than later an opportunity of revenging itself loud cheers underlined to the destruction of the british empire for the misfortunes the oppressions and the misgovernment of our country underlined loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with prolonged cheering said in reply the four patriotic members of the hierarchy who are now your guests the numerous array of the clergy of your county whom i see around me afford indubitable tokens that the union of priests and people has been cemented cheers has been cemented afresh in kildare never to be broken cheers i could dwell for long upon that illustrious character the illustrious position of the dignitaries who are now present in your town hear hear i could remined you of the thrill of joy with which the appointmet sic of his grace of dublin was received by irishmen all the world over cheers i could allude to his great learning and to the profound ability with which he has dealt with the political and the religious questions of the day i welcome him loud cheers as one of the strongest supporters that providence has ever vouchsafed to your cause cheers i could remind you of the long services to ireland undertaken in times of great risk and peril and especially of grave risk and peril so high an ecclesiastic by his grace the great archbishop of the south the archbishop of cashel cheers in him the land league has its strongest and most stalwart defender cheers underlined and when after the suppression of the land league to take up its work and more than its work underlined cries of bravo that great man was the first to come forward and give his adhesion to the movement to defend its constitutional character from its detractors and to prove that the people of ireland banded together in this great organisation were banded together peaceably and constitutionally and not for the purpose of crime outrage and disrespect of the law a voice three cheers for parnell and success to davitt cheers mr parnell these four years have achieved many things you triumphed over and broke down coercion cheers you have snaffled landlordism cheers we will put the curb in their mouths by and by cheers the labourers in the labourers enactment have received the first earnest of the intention of the legislature to recognise some portion of their birthright in the soil a voice it is time mr parnell your parliamentary representatives have turned what had been before our time a mockery and a dishonest delusion into a reality and by good and honest services they have attracted to themselves the confidence the sympathy and the respect of every irishman from the highest to the lowest from the archbishop to the humblest peasant in his cabin cheers i am entitled to say then that never within the same short period has any nation by constitutional action only by peaceable means made such enormous and gigantic strides cheers you have achieved as much in that time as many other nations have only gained after a long and bloodthirsty struggle but it is rather concerning the future that i have come to speak to you to day cheers the great and all absorbing topic in ireland agricultural country as she is and depending upon the soil for her very existence is the land question the land question is at the root of all other questions hear hear the land is the only dependence of the people and what is the present position of the land question in my judgment the landlords are standing on the brink of a precipice and they are doing their best to get themselves pushed over it they are engaged at present in their congenial and accustomed operation of endeavouring to draw blood out of a stone laughter and groans the land during the last year or two has not earned any rent i doubt very much whether during the last year it has earned anything at all it certainly has not earned the judicial rents so far as we can see the irish landlords are about to enter into a conspiracy to extract the present rents out of the tenants whether they can pay them or not we saw the other day that the cork landlords had met and come to a resolution that they regarded the judicial rents as the rents which they were going to extract if they could underlined well i do not regard the judicial rents as being any more sacred than any other rent cheers we never compromised our position by accepting either the land act of cheers or the judicial rents cheers and we are in this position that we are able to say that nobody can point to any word of ours which gave away the right of the irish people to turn upon the judicial rents if their rents proved to be such that they were unable to pay them in the future that is one portion of the conspiracy underlined the conspiracy to exact which have not been made and there is another conspiracy or rather another part of the same conspiracy they are using the land purchase act in many cases through the country to intimidate their tenants who are in arrear to buy their farms at a price which it will be impossible for them to maintain hereafter that is to say they are endeavouring to make a dishonest bargain with the tenants to give them the landlords more than the land is worth in order that they may get out of their position and substitute the state and the english taxpayer as the landlord and leave the new landlord to bear the loss which otherwise should fall to the lot of the old one i said a while ago that the landlords were standing at the brink of a precipice underlined there can be no shadow of doubt that the land act will be amended in the very near future either by an english or an irish parliament cheers so as to bring about a further reduction of the judicial rents of at least or per cent cheers underliend there can be no shadow of doubt about that the english parliament would do it let alone an irish parliament the new democratic parliament won't be at all so tender of the rights of landlords as the last one was even supposing the settlement of the question is to be left to them which i do not think it will be cheers and i don't suppose that the new democratic parliament elected by household suffrage in england will continue to go on paying twelve thousand policemen irish policemen for what not to preserve the peace not to arrest stray donkeys that may be trespassing on the roadside laughter not even to bring an odd young man who may have taken perhaps a sup too much after a fair not even to bring such an odd young man to the barracks no they are paying all these men for the purpose of extracting rackrents for irish landlords but it is not that alone they have to keep thirty thousand soldiers in the country as well and at the time of the land league they had to keep forty thousand cheers so that practically speaking you have an expenditure of five or six millions of pounds sterling a year nearly all of it paid by the english taxpayers and all for the purpose of screwing rackrents out of irish tenants i am very sure that that sort of thing will not be allowed to go on would not it be a very wise thing for the irish landlords to recognise the situation in time to see that if they don't be reasonable they will be chucked overboard altogether cheers the best advice that i could give to them would be this i would say to them use this irish land purchase act that has been passed in a just and equitable spirit towards your tenants sell to them as far as the six millions of money will go at a fair value underlined don't be standing out for a high price because you won't get it and perhaps the day will come when you will get nothing at all laughter underlined refrain from using this act as an engine of intimidation take it as it was offered to you as we offered it to you when we helped in its passage take it as a golden bridge to escape from an untenable position hear hear and cheers and be thankful to the tenants i would say on the other hand that where a fair offer is made to them by a landlord to sell there is nothing to be got either for themselves or for the country by refusing or holding out against it we have had some definitions of what is or what would be a fair price for the tenants to give there have been different opinions given as to the number of years purchase which a tenant ought to give and which he ought not to exceed i should not like owing to the very varying circumstances affecting land in ireland to lay down any hard and fast rule as to the number of years purchase to be given by a tenant at the present judicial rents but i would say this to you that where an estate is for sale the tenants of that estate should meet together and make up their minds what rent they can afford to pay for the future from year to year what rent they would be able to pay their landlords if their present landlords continued in this position what rent they would be able to pay while fulfilling their obligations to their family and the community at large and i would say that in my judgment the judicial rent much exceeds that rent when you have decided upon this you should deduct from that fair rent the various charges annual charges which the landlord has to pay now and which you will have to pay if you become your own landlord for instance you should deduct half the poor rate you should deduct half the county cess in those cases where the landlord at present allows half the county cess you should deduct the income tax which the landlord now has to pay and which you would have to pay if you took his place you should deduct the tithe rent charge and you should deduct the agent fees and costs of collection laughter you should deduct an allowance for bad debts for even irish landlords very seldom in these years get the whole of a rackrent and you should further deduct an allowance for the additional taxation which will certainly in the near future be placed on the land for the purpose of developing the education of the country cheers you should add these deductions together and deduct the total of that from the fair rent and when you have made these deductions you will arrive at the net amount which the landlord is in the habit of getting and probably very much more than the net amount which he will be in the habit of getting if he continues to be a landlord you will then be able to give him a liberal number of years purchase on the net amount that he is likely to get i wish to say a few words with regard to the position of the present government the present government are at all events entitled to this consideration from you that they have resolved during the interval between the old parliament and the new to rely on the capacity for self government of the irish people to restrain the minority amongst them from the commission of offences against the law from crime or outrage of any description they deliberately refrained from renewing the coercion act and the fact that they have taken up this position i don't say that they could have done anything else laughter the fact that they have taken up this position is being used as an engine against them i consider most meanly by the english radical and liberal party cries of chamberlain i think men of kildare you should bear that in mind and you should resolve that as far as in you lies nothing that you do or advise should be such as to make the present government regret the position they have taken cheers i was pleased to see that agrarian offences in ireland in the month after the lapse of the crimes act showed a considerable diminution upon the month prior to the lapse of the crimes act is not that a token of the power in the irish people when they resolve that there shall be no crime in their midst cheers underlined and i hope that next month will show a still further diminution underlined there was a great conspiracy another conspiracy raised amongst the english newspapers to exaggerate the amount of crime in this country they failed in proving that there was any increase in outrages agrarian offences although they unblushingly asserted that that there was their assertion that there is has been naied sic as a lie by lord salisbury in his recent speech cheers and they now fall back upon talk about boycotting they say there is a boycotting conspiracy in this country and that it is impossible for any honest man to live there by the honest man they mean the rack renting landlord laughter now in former times i remember the late chief secretary cries of buckshot my late lamented friend mr forster used when he was talking about boycotting to say that he would not mind the boycotting but that it was the sanction of the boycotting that he objected to that without the sanction of this boycotting the boycotting itself would fail in its effect and the sanctions of the boycotting according to him were the outrages very lamentable and very deplorable outrages which i am glad to say have disappeared from out midst moonlighting and maiming of cattle in some instances and the shooting of obnoxious individuals in others i hope they will never return to us cries of never according to mr forster it was these deplorable occurrences that made the sanction of boycotting but in the present case i call the world to witness that the public opinion of the people amongst whom wrong doers exist the public opinion of the honest people of every locality has asserted itself that has on the one hand kept down outrages and on the other hand it has kept down that worst form of felony the stealing of one man land by his neighbours cheers so that they are obliged to admit that public opinion has been sufficient to deter the evil doer on the one hand and on the other and now i wish to say kildare claims this much from the present government and i claim no more i claim that where a combination and i have not advised such a combination i have in no case during the last few years advised any combination amongst tenants against even rackrents any combination that may exist in the country is a combination of an isolated character it is confined to the tenants of individual estates who of their own accord without any incitement from us on the contrary kept back by us without any urging on our part without any advice on our part but stung by necessity and the terrible realities of their position may have formed some combination amongst themselves to secure such a reduction of rent as will enable them to live in their own home cheers now i claim from the government that if such a combination exists they should treat it as they would treat a combination in england amongst workmen against an unjust employer of labour or an unjust capitalist and if they put their weight into the scales against the irish people if they unjustly come to the assistance of the oppressor then all i can say is that i believe that the strength of determination of our people will survive this further unjust conspiracy between the government of england and the rackrenting landlords of ireland and that at the close of our struggle our people will not be the defeated one loud and prolonged cheering\n",

      "men of historic clare it is now a little over four years since in this town of ennis we practically consecrated the movement of the great land league cheers it is true that before that meeting

galway but it was reserved for the people of clare at ennis at the time which i have mentioned to set an example to the rest of ireland which resulted in the spread of our organisation and movement

again come together that they should again vow their fealty to the cause of ireland cheers that they should again give that support and assistance to their national leaders cheers which they have always been willing to render cheers it is also right that we should take this opportunity of looking back over the interval and see what we have gained and what we have suffered and to consider what

groans you remember how he came one day into your midst with his panoply of horsemen and footmen about him by the way we didn't see any of them here to day cheers a voice we don't want them another voice they are in the pawnoffice to day laughter mr parnell and in a single night by arbitrary and unconstitutional violence tore from their homes twenty two respectable men the heads of families the merchants the traders the tenant farmers of your district hear hear and having hurried them off to prison without charge or accusation of crime kept them in prison for many long months however you have again in your midst every one of these men cheers still without charge and without accusation having been brought against them and they will remain as many others in other parts of ireland will remain monuments of the most vicious cowardly and cruel system of misrule under which a country has ever laboured cheers you have suffered a great deal but you are here still monuments to the truth of the old saying that all things are possible to those who wait cheers you have gained something also the land act the land act was passed as the consequence of your exertions and those of other men like you throughout the country in speaking of this land act i regret that it was not so framed and so administered as to secure a lasting and final settlement of the great irish question it was not our fault that the act failed to secure a final settlement of the question on the floor of the house of commons we pointed out its defects and showed in what way it was bound to fail hear but we were to a great extent disregarded in this country we warned the tenants of ireland not to put too implicit faith in it and we were put in prison for giving that warning cheers have not our words and our action been justified by the results cheers i deeply regret i say that the act was not so fashioned and administered as to prove a permanent settlement of the land question we all desire to get this question out of our way we all desire to see it settled it has failed because the remonstrances and opinions of the irish members during its passage through parliament were to a great extent disregarded cheers the healy clause the only part of the act which is worth a straw is the healy clause that clause if it had been fairly administered would have gone a long way by itself and it was only four lines long to have settled the question but that clause was mutilated in the administration of the act by the machinations of the lawyers and in addition unfortunately the head commission was composed partly of weak colourless men without soul and without mind groans and its other part was composed of the representatives of the landlords and their paid agent cheers this head commission has shown by its vacillating and contradictory course that where it has not been dishonest it has been timid and cowardly cheers and it has lost the great opportunity it had in its important position of doing much for the final settlement of this great question hear hear so here we are to day cheers a voice you're welcome mr parnell once more after having given a patient as i recommended you to do a too patient trial to the land act after having by bitter experience proved it valueless we are met here again to day to put our shoulders to the wheel cheers to take counsel together as to what we shall do and to encourage each other by mutual consultation and in all those other ways in which the assembly of a vast meeting constitutes so potent an agent what have we to do now what have we further to do in order to enable the tenant farmer to occupy his holding and to enjoy his improvements and those of his predecessors in title free from crushing imposition of rack rents your representatives in parliament will be able to do much they will be able to insist that the healy clause shall be amended in such a way as to carry out the words of mr gladstone when the act was being passed they will be enabled to insist that the labourer shall have fair play the allocation of a portion of land and a good house as his own but very much remains for you to do besides within the strict limits of the constitution you can see that the evicted tenants victims of the last land way are properly supported by your exertions i tell you the farmers of clare that every shilling you contribute to the support of evicted tenants men who have gone out on principle sooner than surrender to felonius sic landlordism that every penny spent in the support and maintenance of these men will be worth thousands of pounds to you in the ultimate settlement of this question applause underlined you have not done your duty in this respect i must tell you during the last four years and had it not been for the money we received from australia and from america these victims the wounded in war would have been trampled upon by the landlords underlined cheers the longest purse however i am happy to say that we have been able to protect them and that we have proved in our struggle with the emergency committee hisses and the land corporation of ireland that our purse is still the longest and that for every pound that we have had to spend we have made them spend two laughter and cheers but there is another class scarcely indeed a class a few misguided individuals amongst the nation to whom i would also address an appeal the land grabbers i would address myself specially to those poor weak men misguided creatures who where a landlord has evicted a tenant owing to his failure to pay an unjust rent feel themselves tempted by the father of evil to go in and take possession of the evicted farm pity rather than denunciation or illfeeling sic is needed from us and from you towards such persons and i trust that when any individual and i am happy to say there are none such i believe amongst you feels disposed to violate the divine commandment by taking possession under such circumstances of that which does not belong to him he will listen to what i have to say to him now that he will feel within him the promptings of patriotism and of religion cheers and that he will turn away from the temptation and act as an honest irishman cheers let him remember that he is doing a great injustice to his country and his class that though he may perhaps benefit materially for a little while yet that ill gotten gains cannot prosper let him feel within himself the instincts of patriotism and let him put the great bulk of his fellow countrymen in the position to say that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repenteth than over ninety nine just men who need no repentance cheers to hell or connaught and now men of clare i have come to the conclusion of what i have to say to you i hope you will find yourselves encouraged and strengthened by coming together to day as i undoubtedly shall find myself encouraged and strengthened by meet you cheers you are assembled here the relics of a noble race almost at the brink of almost driven into the atlantic but yet not quite driven into the atlantic cheers and laughter you are the descendants of men whom cromwell tried to send to hell or to connaught and he only succeeded in sending them as far as connaught cheers during many centuries you have baffled and defeated the attempts of the english enemy to drive you from the soil of sacred ireland and i believe that it is to you and to the men of this west coast of our country to show such an example to the irish race as will enable us to stand shoulder to shoulder to march from the west to the east cheers and to recover inch by inch slowly but surely every rood of land which has been robbed from us\n",

      "mr mccarthy and comrades i shall not venture to follow you sir in your kind words regarding myself and the feelings of the party towards myself but i will only say that in my experience of our parliamentary movement during epoch we have just closed i have always considered of the party that i ought to think a great deal more and to value my colleagues a great deal more highly than they should value me for my services no in looking back upon these years we might perhaps to night be tempted to refer to our legislative achievements but i feel convinced that i interprete sic your sentiments best and most fully as i certainly express my own when i say that each and all of us have only looked upon the acts the legislative enactments which we have been able to wring from an unwilling parliament as means towards an end hear and cheers that we would have at any time in the hours of our deepest depression and the greatest discouragement that we would have spurned and rejected any measure however tempting and however apparent for the benefit of our people if we had been able to detect that behind it lurked any danger to the legislative independence of our land loud and prolonged cheering the abounding feeling and although during this parliament which has just expired we may have said very little about home rule very little was said about legislative independence very little about repeal of the union cheers yet i know well that through each of your hearts the thought of how those great things might be best forwarded was never for a moment absent loud cheers and that no body of irishmen ever met together who have more consistently worked and worked with a greater effect for that which always must be the hope of our nation until its realisation arrives loud cheers we might i say refer to those legislative achievements we might refer to the land act an admirable measure in its way even an unthought of measure since many of us have come into political life even within the time of the political life of many of us an unthought of measure cheers we might dwell on the franchise act under which almost manhood suffrage has been conceded to ireland we might recall to our recollection the redistribution act under which despite the open hostility of one party and the hardly concealed envy of the other we succeeded in getting in the new parliament the full representation of ireland without the loss of a single man cheers but these things although important in themselves are not as i have said the end and aim of our existence as a party hear hear and although we have always and wisely i think made it part of our programme to gain for ireland such concessions as might be got at the while provided we did not sacrifice greater and more enduring national interests yet we have always got before us that we were sent from this country not to remain long in westminster laughter and cheers but to remember that it was for us to look upon our presence but to remember that it was for us to look upon our presence there as a voluntary one and to regard our future our legislative future as belonging to our own native country of ireland loud cheers i therefore prefer gentlemen not to dwell upon these important legislative enactments as i have said all of them means to an end but to consider two things which are even more pleasing to my mind than any such matters the achievements of the party i look back with fondness upon your actions during the past five years cheers i look back with admiration upon the position that the party has achieved for itself mr mccarthy was good enough to say that to my leadership i think that term it was he used that to me was due the credit and the honour i cannot endorse that statement mr arthur o'connor but we do mr parnell they say a bad workman finds fault with his instruments but certainly i have not been able to find fault with my assistants a laugh i don't wish to imply in any respect that i claim for myself the position of a good workman hear hear by no means the goodness of the work is due to my colleagues i think that few can estimate the extraordinary ability the wonderful industry the genius the discipline the absolute self negation the unselfishness the courage the devotion that has been displayed by each one of you and it would require a knowledge such as i can only have and it would require a tongue or a pen far beyond my power to hand down to history my opinion of your services to your country i cannot attempt the task of describing or estimating the enormous task of describing or estimating the enormous important value of what you have done during the five years which are now about to close i can only say as regards myself that it has been a constant that those services have been my constant admiration that i have marvelled that it was possible for any nation for any country to get together such a body of men under any circumstances but that it should have been possible for ireland in her position with all her talent her supposed best talent divorced from her with the terrible engines and means which have been used to terrify to cajole and to persuade her sons to enlist under another flag than her own hear hear it is a marvel to me it seems to me that it must have been a dispensation of providence that it could have been possible for our country to have found such sons and to have been served as she has been served during the five years of the parliament of to the present position and what is our present position it is admitted by all parties that you have brought the question of irish legislative independence to the point of solution hear hear and cheers it is not now a question of self government for ireland it is only a question as to how much of the self government they will be able to cheat us out of hear hear it is not now a question of whether the irish people shall decide their own destinies and their own future but it is a question with i was going to say our english masters but i am afraid we cannot call them masters in ireland it is a question with them as to how far the day that they consider the evil day shall be deferred you are therefore entitled to say that so far you have done well you have done miraculously well and we hand to our successors an unsullied flag a battle more than half won and a brilliant history hear hear and cheers the future we now come to the question of the future i won't say that we come to the question of the choice of your successors because i hope none of us will have any successors laughter but we come to the choice of our future colleagues i suppose it will be necessary for each one of us to take a future colleague under his wing in the new parliament we shall each be mated we shall each have a new member to induct into the mysteries of the alien assembly laughter but gentlemen undoubtedly upon the choice of our future colleagues and their future action will in all human probability depend without exaggeration the future of ierland sic and the fate of the nation at all events in our time hear there is therefore a great responsibility an unprecedented responsibility now thrown upon the constituencies in regard to this question of the choice of our future colleagues and there is a considerable responsibility upon us too the new men we ought not to be very modest in the present position of affairs we shall require undoubtedly in the new men of the irish party the best ability the sturdiest honesty and inflexibility the truest judgment and the most absolute self negation that the country can supply hear hear these are the qualities however difficult to obtain that are specially difficult to secure in the hurly burly of a general election and looking on the matter from every point of view and having due regard to the undoubted right of constituents to judge and to judge very largely for themselves in these matters desirous as we are to divide the responsibility if necessary as it is for us to divide the responsibility with the constituents of ireland a voice in the selection i think we may fairly claim in reference to this selection of candidates i may fairly claim loud applause for you renewed applause and for myself the right of consultation with the constituents cheers that is not a matter that could be said to be trespassing upon any right which belongs to the nation at large hear hear the general and the officers of an army are entitled to some voice in the choice of their colleagues and comrades hear hear and they usually exercise a very much larger voice than any which we claim or ever have claimed hear hear we claim therefore and it is a very modest claim we claim the right of consulting with the constituencies so as to provide a safeguard for the preservation of the party and of the country too hear hear from men prejudicial to that united harmonious sagacious and upright course without which the party instead of winning the national battle would run a very great risk of losing it hear hear i shall now go further a little underlined the programme underlined i have already spoken of the past and of the immediate future and i shall ask you to accompany me for a moment a little beyond that to the time when ireland having prudently and sagaciously selected her eighty or eighty five representatives will have sent them over to the battle and as we all hope and believe the final battle the last battle cheers what will be the new programme we have had conventions and conferences and it has been the custom to include a number of measures in addition to the great measure of all the restoration of an irish parliament the concession of legislative independence cheers we have had resolutions about land acts franchise acts municipal acts labourers acts and so forth all pointing to the belief in our minds as those who are primarily responsible for the drafting of our programme that it would be necessary for us to pay attention as well to remedial measures in fact that there would be time to pay attention to remedial measures before winning the final and great and ultimate measure of all cheers now that undoubtedly although it cannot be described as putting the cart before the horse yet i hope that it may not be necessary for us in the new parliament to devote our attention to subsidiary measures cheers underlined and that it may be possible for us to have a programme and a platform with only one plank cheers and that one the plank of national independence renewed cheers underlined i feel convinced mr mccarthy and comrades that our great work and our sole work in the new parliament will be underlined the restoration of our parliament underlined hear hear and loud cheering and when we have obtained it what will be its functions and what will be its powers underlined we shall require our new parliament to do those things which we have been asking the british parliament to do for us we shall require them to develop the healy clause of the land act to abolish evictions landlord oppression and rackrenting hear hear to make every tenant farmer the owner of his holding upon fair terms we shall require that power to do this shall be given to our parliament hear hear we shall require our new parliament to secure to the labourers a share in the heritage of the land and comfortable houses underlined we shall not have to depend upon the halting action of ex officio boards of guardians underlined we shall require our own parliament to build up the industries of ireland hear hear to see that not only the agricultural labourers but that the artisans hear hear the workingmen and the mechanics of the towns shall be enabled to live and thereby we shall endeavour to keep our people at home hear hear to afford profitable employment to look after the educational interests of the youth of ireland and to train them up in the way they should go both from a religious and a national point of view hear hear underlined we have therefore gentlemen a great work before us both in the english house of commons for a while and also in the irish chamber underlined i hope it will be a single chamber loud applause and that we shall not have a house of lords to cumber us renewed applause underlined but undoubtedly at this time we are entering upon a most important and serious part of our mission because it is a most critical part the reinforced party may the next party contain if possible still greater elements of energy and sagacity honesty and of courage as that which fought through the epoch which has just expired may i find colleagues so generous to their leader and so loyal to each other hear hear but it is the people of ireland on whom the result of this struggle finally depends hear hear i believe the next body of irish members sent to westminster will be well chosen that they will fight and that they will win their battle so far as they can win it but it is undoubtedly upon our people at home that the main burden rests hear hear it is they and they alone who can now defeat the irish cause if they maintain the fixity of purpose and the union of the last five years no power on earth can resist them applause i confide in the judgment and in the patriotism of our people applause and in the new electorate applause i believe that they will not be wanting applause that the great masses now brought within the constitution will do their duty to the fullest extent applause underlined and i therefore feel assured that the next irish party that will be assembled shall be the last in the english and the first in the restored irish parliament loud applause underlined\n",

      "i think that the example which mr harrington has just alluded to and the result of our policy and exertions with regard to the tenants on colonel tottenham estate shows the justness of the line that the national league took up when as successor of the land league it endeavoured and with considerable success to carry on the work of that body the policy which we pursued with regard to the case of the evicted tenants was this whenever we found an estate the tenants on which had stood together and had been evicted or whenever we found any considerable number of tenants who had stood together and been evicted for the sake of principle on the lines of the land league we determined to support those tenants to the utmost extent of our resources hear hear we believe that in doing so we were performing a most valuable work for the rest of the irish tenantry hear hear that the result of sufficient support on our part of such tenants who had held out and been evicted on principle could not fail to be of enormous gain to the rest of the tenants throughout the country hear hear and i am glad to say that our policy has been both directly and indirectly successful because of the estates which we took three years ago on to our list for support underlined estates which required an annual contribution from the league of fully one half have in underlined the interval obtained satisfactory settlements hear hear we were in the habit of making grants to the tenants on colonel tottenham property to the amount of something like or a month annual grants of about and they have now obtained a successful settlement the tottenham estate is one of several estates which have obtained these successful settlements there have been restored to their original holdings families after they had been supported by the irish national league for three years and after they had been supported by the ladies league and the land league previously for about a year or eighteen months underlined these forty nine families have been restored to their homes all the arrears have been wiped off applause four or five years arrears of rent have been wiped off and they have obtained i believe a permanent reduction of rent amounting to some fifteen or twenty per cent per annum underlined but it is not only as regards the direct results in the case of these tenants that our attitude and action is to be commended we have achieved by this action beneficial results enormously beneficial results of an indirect character for the rest of the irish tenantry wherever a landlord saw the tenantry on an evicted estate supported by the funds of the league that estate was a sign and a mark to the rest of the landlords of ireland that if they did likewise if they unjustly evicted their tenants those tenants would be maintained by the league and that in the long run the landlord would get the worst of the transaction applause and i believe that this policy which we have pursued has enabled hundreds of thousands certainly a hundred thousand irish tenants to make settlements out of the land court with their landlords and that it has saved many thousands of families from the eviction which would have been otherwise their cruel fate i regret that we have not been able to awaken in the minds of the tenant farmers of ireland a sufficient sense of the importance of supporting the victims of the land war it would have been very much better for them if they aided our exertions exertions which were sustained by money from australia chiefly applause if they had aided our exertions in this direction the chairman continued it would have been of untold benefit for the farmers of ireland generally if they had shown themselves sensible of the importance of supporting the tenants on evicted estates and i trust that the example of the settlement that the tottenham tenants and other tenants have obtained by standing together in a body will instruct the rest of the irish tenantry and that they will come forward suitably at the commencement of this winter and subscribe to the funds of the league which are mainly used for the relief of evicted tenants and so show the landlords that in the present depression of prices they do not intend to allow themselves to be trampled upon applause now gentlemen we have held to day a very important meeting of the irish party i think quite the largest meeting of that body which has ever had a session in dublin and we have arrived at very vital important resolutions with regard to the question of the selection of candidates during the next two or three months for the general election these resolutions will be published in the press to morrow and i do not intend to read them or to refer to them in detail but i may tell you that generally the resolutions invite the country to select as candidates men of approved worth and reliable character hear hear men who are well fitted for the work in hand and who may be depended upon to maintain and secure the unity of the party and of the country hear the resolutions further advise the constituencies to select their candidates in consultation with my colleagues and myself hear hear at conventions to be duly summoned for the purpose hear hear a pledge has been further formulated in detail loud cheers and the constituencies and the conventions are urged to refuse to consider the candidature of any candidate who refuses to take the pledge loud laughter and applause with regard to the calling of conventions for the purpose of making the selection of candidates for the different constituencies i propose when the proper time arrives and it is not desirable that the conventions in many of the more important districts should be held until we are able to approximate more closely to the result of the revisions than we can now do i propose when the proper time arrives to take steps from this office to enter myself into communication as the chairman of the irish parliamentary party with the different constituencies throughout the country in order to fix suitable and convenient dates dates in sequence to each other for the holding of these very important delegate assemblies i have said that the dates for holding the conventions will not be during the next two or three weeks but after that interval i trust that we shall be able to arrange mr parnell continuing i trust that we shall be able to arrange for several important conventions as a lead off throughout the country and the mode of procedure adopted at the proceedings of these bodies will be a guide to the other assemblies of a similar nature which will have to be convened in the various constituencies for the important work in hand i desire to take the opportunity which has been afforded to me in the presence of such a very large and representative gathering as this composed of the members of the central branch of the league many of whom have come from different parts of ireland to express to you my conviction which has become if possible more firm than ever of the very near approach of the speedy triumph of the national cause loud applause underlined there can be no shadow of doubt gentlemen that if you use your recent victory with judgment and with moderation you will have the two english parties vying with each other in the settlement of the irish question hear hear underlined i believe that we will get a settlement of the national question from whichever government or whichever party may be in power whether it be whig or whether it be tory hear hear there may be slight variations in the terms which we may succeed in securing from the one body or the other underlined but i believe that the settlement which we shall be able to obtain from the tories will be as valuable and as important for the interests of ireland and for the prosperity of the nation as the settlement that we shall be able to obtain from the whigs or the radicals applause underlined we are therefore in the position that no matter which of the english sides loses or which of them wins we are bound to win cheers we ask gentlemen from you in return that you should insist in your different districts upon absolute unity of purpose hear hear and i think that we are entitled to claim for ourselves and we claim nothing more the right of consultation and of advising with the different constituencies throughout the country cries of quite right a general has always some voice in the choice of his officers loud cheers none of us desire to dictate to the constituencies hear hear we should be only too glad to have the difficult burden of selection lightened by the judgment and experience of the different localities interested in this very important question but we do think that there should be absolute union in our ranks hear hear and that if we have shown ourselves in any way worthy of your regard that you should continue to depend upon us cries of we will until we show that we are unfit for the trust we have held up to the present cries of never i thank you gentlemen for the patience with which you have listened to me i desire nothing more than to place in the power of irishmen and of the people of ireland the right to govern themselves and to manage their own affairs when we have restored to us our own parliament it will be possible for you to discuss and thresh out every question every man of different ideas will then have a stage on which he will be able to exemplify and enlarge his views but for the present solidity is necessary in our ranks loud cheers our desire is to restore to you the power of making for yourself and working out your own destiny cheers when you have got that power gentlemen i believe you will use it rightly and bravely and that the irish nation will prosper and be perpetual loud cheers mr parnell rising again said i don't think it is necessary for me to introduce to you your old friend t p o'connor

      "my lord mayor ladies and gentlemen i do not know how adequately to express my feelings with regard not only to your lordship address not only to the address of the parnell national tribute but also regarding this magnificent demonstration for i can call it nothing else but my lord i prefer to leave to the historian the description of to night and the expression of an opinion as regards the result which to night must produce hear hear you my lord have recalled to our memories the historical occasion of the assemblage years ago in this hall i trust that those who come after us i not only trust but i feel sure that those who come after us at the centennial anniversary of to day will occupy a brighter a higher and a greater position and will see their country occupy a greater and a higher position than we are fated to see to day cheers i shall not attempt to reply in any way to your lordship eulogy speaking as an irishman to an assembly of irishmen and irishwomen applause i shall only say that i believe and i think that the result of the great movement of the last few years shows that i am right in that belief cheers that there must have been many irishmen who thought and felt as i did and many undoubtedly more able and more willing than i was no no to give effect to my thoughts and my wishes as an irishman i have no doubt in common with many thousands of my countrymen i looked around me i saw the artizan sic in the towns struggling for a precarious existence with a torpid trade with everything against him i saw the irish tenant farmer trembling before the eye of his landlord hear hear with the knowledge that in that landlord power rested the whole of the future of himself and of his family that his position was literally no better physically not so good as the lot of the south african negro hear hear that he was endeavouring to make both ends meet that his life was a constant struggle to keep the roof over his head and over the head of his family by the most grinding and pinching self denial i saw as you have all seen the irish labourer whose lot even to this day has been but very little improved hear hear but for whom there is now also i trust a ray of light and hope dawning cheers and cries of t p o'connor i saw the irish labourer the lowest of the low the slave of the slave with not even a dry roof over his head with the rain from heaven dripping upon the couch on which he was forced to lie dressed in rags subsisting upon the meanest food and whether i looked upon one side of the social system or upon the other side irresistible conviction was borne back upon me that here was a nation carrying on its life striving for existence striving for nationhood under such difficulties as had never beset any other people on the face of europe hear hear many of us saw these things to many of us these same thoughts occurred and some three years ago we resolved and i am proud and happy to say that at this board to night there are many present who joined in that resolve that these things should no longer be if we could help it and the historian of the future will say for the land league movement if he be unprejudiced and faithful that never was thee a movement formed to contend against such an infamous and horrible system a system which even the british parliament and the influence and laws of england have already partially admitted to be a gigantic system of robbery and fraud cheers that never was there a movement formed to contend against such a system with so much odds against it in the carrying out of which i will not even say in connection with which underlined but in association with which there was so much moderation and discretion and such an utter absence of crime underlined and of the strong passions which agitate men cheers in which the closing words of the sentence were lost ireland is not in a normal condition if she had been we never should have had the system of landlordism that my friend mr davitt has devoted his life and vowed his future to the extermination of cheers we never should have had it and we certainly should not have it now were it not that this system is upheld by a stronger nation and a stronger power than our own we always have to take into account that no matter how we may strive to keep within the limits of the constitution this strong people outside of us and practically opposed to us will always meet us with the rule of force and in striving for and obtaining the partial justice that we have yet obtained we have been met with this rule of force look about you on every side you see over soldiers of the regular army retained in ireland you see another and more efficient army of policemen for the same purpose you have seen the law the ancient law of habeas corpus repeatedly thrown away in regard to ireland and the most signal example of this particular breach of the constitution out of many breaches which are being constantly made in the british constitution in ireland laughter was when one thousand irishmen were thrown into prison by the late lamented buckshot forster groans and laughter we are now living under a coercion which is the combined result of the irish question and how to meet it by coercion by lawyers and statesmen of england groans well gentlemen in face of all this in face of the fact that no man life much less his liberty is at the present moment safe lord hartington has the coolness to tell us that the liberal party will co operate with the irish party laughter a voice if he gets a chance mr parnell when we abandon our unconstitutional ways and use only constitutional methods laughter i would rather have preferred to say that until the liberal party abandon their unconstitutional methods and betake themselves to the observance of even the british constitution there can be no co operation between english liberals and irishmen cheers in respect to those matters connected with the advancement of popular liberties and the progress of general reform to which such co operation would be fairly permissible under normal conditions loud cheers to enable such a co operation and i don't know whether such co operation will ever take place it does not look likely at the present moment i must confess to enable such co operation as would be consistent and permissible with our present position as an independent irish party there must be no more coercion and there must be no more emigration loud and continued cheers we regard any system of emigration which has yet been tried in this country as a murderous blow loud cheers against the life of our nation renewed cheers accompanied by untold sufferings to the unhappy individuals on whom the experiment is made cheers it is useless for the tuke committee to present us with their carefully selected cases of certain individuals who have been prosperous in their new home beyond the atlantic we know enough from better experience what must be the fate of the unfortunate man who has emigrated with his family at the rate of per head including the passage money hear hear and we have irresistible proof to show that three fourths of the emigrants who have been sent out from ireland during the last year or two have been compelled to find their homes in the miserable garrets of new york boston and montreal cheers whatever mr tuke individual motives may be and he may be a philanthropist of the purest water for all i know the proceedings of his committee stand exposed as an indecent attempt to assist the government to get rid of the irish difficulty by getting rid of the irish people and to shield them from the responsibility which rightly belonged to them of providing for the welfare of the irish people so long as they insist upon the right of governing us we can hold no parley with emigrationists or coercionists applause if we are to be emigrated and coerced we prefer to have the dose administered by our natural enemies the tories hear hear rather than by those wolves in sheep clothing the whigs hisses if emigration must be tried if it such a wonderfully good thing for the poor people why should they not try it upon some of those congested districts in london applause if i mistake not any attempt to bring into practical operation the theories of lord spencer and lord derby hisses with regard to emigration would lead and by the way we never heard of lord spencer hisses carrying any child out of the slums of st giles on board an emigrant ship in the thames any such attempt i say upon their part would lead to the opening up of questions and the suggestion of principles by no means palatable to the landed proprietors of england hear hear now gentlemen we have not arrived at our present position without having to submit to and to suffer a very great deal it is the history of every measure of reform of every advance for public liberties in ireland that it has to be accompanied by great suffering for the people by great sacrifices on the part of individuals and by relatively very small gains in proportion to the exertions which have been made who can doubt what would have happened to landlordism in ireland if any other european country was face to face with the movement of the last few years it would no longer have troubled us but we have in our country hard facts to meet with and to grapple with underlined we have such individuals as lord spencer and mr trevelyan groans underlined and i do not think i exaggerate when i say that although these two individuals have been vastly helped by the coercion act of which they have made such liberal use i do not think i exaggerate when i say that the present irish executive is probably characterised by greater meanness and by greater incapacity hear hear than any other of its predecessors that it is certain just as certain as that our poor friend mr forster groans and laughter was obliged to retire precipitately from this country or rather was not allowed to come back to erin laughter that it is just as certain that this present government of ireland will prove sooner or later and probably much sooner than later as great and as conspicuous a failure as any of its predecessors applause for lord spencer there is of course some excuse he does not owe his position to the fact that he has distinguished himself in the walks of literature laughter or to the fact that he is even a representative of the people renewed laughter he has been distinguished by none of those qualities which go to make a statesman laughter he simply came over to ireland as the assistant of mr forster groans and it is most desirable since it is so often dinned into our ears about the mingled gentleness and firmness i think that is most desirable that we should always remember that we should never forget that the present lord lieutenant of ireland simply came over as a very inferior bottle holder to mr forster loud and prolonged applause underlined it was therefore to be expected that lord spencer should distinguish himself by the administration of the new coercion not by his refusal to spare that pillar of english rule in ireland mr marwood from any of the duties of his office hisses by his imprisonment and his tortures by his fines and police quartered upon an unoffending and guiltless people underlined we are not surprised i say that lord spencer should do his little best to imitate the biggest of the big coercionists who ever came to ireland and that he should desire to give full play to the unbridled insolence and passion of the foreign garrison in ireland applause but what can we say of mr trevelyan groans a distinguished radical the good nephew of his great grand uncle laughter mr forster used to have a trick of overwhelming us all by saying that his great ambition was to enable everybody in ireland to do what they had a legal right to do laughter but mr trevelyan great ambition seemed to be to prevent anybody in ireland from doing what they had a legal right to do laughter and prolonged cheers take for instance three salient examples of mr trevelyan in ireland his imprisonment of my honourable friend mr harrington a simple young creature laughter thought that he might tell some of his tenant farmer constituents that if they did not do something for the labourers the irish members in the house of commons would stop exerting themselves for the purpose of amending the act by the admission of leaseholders within the land act the amendment of the healy clause and so forth mr harrington of course has a perfectly legal right to do this over in westminster but he had not a legal right to tell his constituents in ireland that he was going to do it in westminster and accordingly he was put into prison and he was taught on the plank bed that although he might have a legal right in westminster he had no legal right at all in ireland hear hear take the second example the proceedings in reference to the suppression of the kerry sentinel mr harrington brother was engaged in the perfectly legal occupation of bringing out a country newspaper a country weekly newspaper it was not a newspaper that had set any large portion of the west of ireland on fire i am not aware that he had set even a large portion of the county on fire at all events mr harrington brother had been engaged in bringing out this weekly newspaper for twenty months during the existence of mr forster coercion act without ever having been reasonably suspected of a single thing laughter ah yes but mr trevelyan was going to change all that he knew better he knew that the brothers harrington were very dangerous men applause and one day when the printer devil who had by some misfortune got into mr harrington employment took it into his head to beguile an idle hour by snatching a proof purporting to be an invincible notices from mr harrington type the great excuse was framed and the printing press of the kerry sentinel was seized the type was destroyed the newspaper was suppressed they were all sent off to dublin castle the boy admitted that he had done this thing and without the knowledge of the editor or of any responsible person about the place the notice in question presented all the internal and external evidence of want of genuineness and want of authenticity no child even would have said for a moment that it really was what it purported to be as well might you flog the schoolmaster because an idle schoolboy drew a picture upon his slate but mr harrington was made to suffer in person and in property for the fault of the boy in his employment and as we are sitting around this banquet board i think no greater example in a small way can be found of the utter unscrupulousness of our rulers or their utter want of common interest applause than the fact that mr harrington is still detained as a common felon within a prison walls lying on a prison bed and eating prison fare shame underlined for an offence of which it must be perfectly well known to those men in dublin castle that he is as absolutely innocent as i am applause underlined a voice we will have revenge mr parnell my friend says we will have revenge all i can say is that he will have to have lots of patience before he has his revenge i now come to the last example of this most pernicious and extraordinary government the suppression of the northern meetings mr trevelyan may be able to cross the water and hoodwink the simple people of the galashiels but he is not going to throw dust on any section of the irish people either irish nationalists or irish orangemen cheers and i can hardly believe that mr trevelyan does himself the honour of believing what he told them hear hear all through his speech it is easy to detect the self satisfied chuckle of the man who exaggerates for his own purpose the danger likely to arise from the action of a few poor wretched orangemen and who deliberately exaggerates for the same purpose the resources for mischief of the landlords who hire them cheers he admits the illegality of these proceedings from the top to the bottom he describes them in the most forcible language while he enormously magnifies the results likely to arise to them cheers and what is his excuse for the action of the government an action you must remember exactly in accord with the wishes and demands of the law breakers his excuse was that it would take infantry and cavalry to protect the constitutional right of public meeting and enable those seeking an alteration in the law to do what they had a legal right to do if nationalists meet together to obtain an alteration of the land act if my lord mayor goes to derry to deliver a lecture cheers on the excuse for proclaiming the meeting in the one case and for at best winking at the designs of the assassins who fired at him was that it would take infantry and cavalry to do anything else did the government hesitate to protect the lough mask expedition in because it took infantry and cavalry to protect them did they ever refuse protection to any landlord engaged in the eviction of his tenants or to any sheriff engaged in forestalling the land act by selling out the interest of the tenant did the english government was it ever know to refuse all the arms and all the men that might be necessary for such a purpose no did the government shrink from holding untried men in prison for twelve long months in and lest any impediment would be offered to the legal rights of the landlord class no all our experience of english force in ireland results in this that they are always willing to employ that force to the fullest extent while it is a question of protecting the so classed rights of the minority against the majority cheers the proceedings in the north teach us this lesson that the law in ireland is only powerful when the minority applies for protection it is then quick to strike is very vengeful and unmerciful but when after great struggling it may happen that a statute of beneficial import to the people of ireland survives in a mutilated condition the two houses of parliament we find that the operation of the law in putting in force that statute is slow halting and ineffectual and until the english liberals and radicals learn the first lesson of their political creed that every nation every country has a right to be governed according to the will of the majority of that country they will fail as they have always failed in their self imposed task of governing the irish people cheers gentlemen we are told about the franchise the liberal party is going we hear to extend the franchise to ireland i am very much inclined to believe that were it not that there exists in the house of commons a solid band of solid men cheers who would vote steadily against any extension of the suffrage in england if ireland were left out we would see very little of the inclusion of ireland in the forthcoming bill we can survey these contests between the english parties with perfect equanimity our position is a strong and a winning one underlined whether they extend the franchise to ireland or not we will return i believe between seventy or eighty members cheers underlined our cause is undoubtedly a winning cause and though the progress we may be making at present in the face of coercion must be slow yet still we are progressing we are keeping up and even adding to the impetus that was given to the national cause in the days of the irish national land league movement and although it is hard although ones blood often boils at witnessing the indignities and suffering and persecutions which the people of this country are obliged to submit to every day and night we must be patient we have every reason to be patient we shall win if we are patient cheers the miserable character of the shifts and evasions which the irish executive have daily resorted to show that we must win cheers coercion cannot last for ever cheers and there is one thing to be said as this coercion act is running out and as we are living it down there is one thing we must remember and remind the english people of namely that if there is one fact more certain than another it is that if we are to be coerced even if the present coercion act or any part of it is to be renewed if the constitution is not to be restored to us these things shall be done by the tory government and not by the liberal government cheers and shall carry with them in the shape of increased taxation the fruits and penalties inflicted upon us beyond a shadow of a doubt it will be for the irish people in england poorly as they are supported and isolated as they are and for your independent members to determine at the next general election whether the tory or liberal ministries shall rule england this is a great force and a great power if we may not rule ourselves we can at least cause them to be ruled as we choose cheers this force has already gained for ireland inclusion in the coming franchise bill and we have reason to be proud hopeful and energetic determined that this generation shall not pass away until it has bequeathed to those who come after us the great birthright of national independence and prosperity loud cheers i have had the honour and pleasure of the acquaintance of the lord mayor for many years i have watched his progress in public life and i have never ceased to felicitate ireland and myself that we were fortunate enough to have in the chair of the chief magistracy of ireland such a man as the present lord mayor cheers a gentleman of moderate politics the lord mayor can bind a firm and unyielding devotion to principle hear hear of unequal courage he withstood all the fascinations and influences of the viceregal court cheers he was neither ashamed nor afraid but he was proud to take his stand by his country when she was in trouble and by his countrymen when they were in prison i cannot express to you the magnitude of the services of the right hon the lord mayor it would be utterly impossible for me with my feeble powers of speech to tell you what i think regarding the importance of the fact that we have had him to fill the chair of the dublin mayoralty he has encouraged the irish municipalities to enter upon a new future he has shown them the importance and the weight and the power which they undoubtedly possess he has stimulated the corporations and the town commissioners in every part of ireland to claim for the majority of the people their due share in the management of their local affairs and i cannot doubt that to the dignity which he has added to the mayor chair in dublin to the lustre which he has shed over the great office which he holds will be due very much of the success which we hope to obtain in the near future of local self government and municiyal sic privileges in ireland cheers contrast the position of the dublin corporation to day with what it was even in the memory of many of us no such change could have been expected in so short a time undoubtedly the power of national self government and the capacity of a nation to govern itself springs from the perfection of local and municipal institutions the lord mayor has always shown himself alive to the means of securing the suffrage for the people in order that the franchise which in cork is only exercised by persons rated at and in other cities is equally restricted may be extended to what it is in england i trust though i fear that we never can have another lord mayor like the present occupant of the chair i trust and believe and feel certain that his successor will happily and gallantly carry the banner which he hands to him and that he will not allow those traditions and those principles to deteriorate or to be tarnished i have great pleasure in asking you to drink the health of our gallant lord mayor

      "mr mayor ladies and gentlemen i feel exceedingly indebted to you for the honourable and kind way in which you have received the toast of my health although the good time which was predicted for drogheda and ireland upon the advent of a certain politician here laughter has not yet arrived i think i am entitled to say with mr sexton that we may expect the good time a comparatively good time or if you like it a less bad time and one which seemed during the last year or two becoming better we may expect to see the time approaching drogheda to which the genius of her children and the heroism of her struggle entitles her applause the prospects i hope are bright and brilliant for ireland at present for four years the comparative advance of which i have spoken has been marked by constant and repeated victories four years ago the people of ireland that is such of them as are entrusted with the vote returned at short notice and in the face of very great difficulties of every kind returned for the first time to parliament an independent united party pledged to keep aloof from both the english parties and for four sessions that party for the first time in the history of parliamentary relations between england and ireland has kept its pledges has remained unbroken has continually added to its strength its discipline and its knowledge applause and has constantly extracted from its enemies testimony of its worth and its power the giant assaults following the comparative triumph at the polls in the giant assaults of the land league against irish landlordism had resulted in the passage of a land act which though imperfect very important in many of its details and though administered with a feebleness which has still further impaired its useful character applause though crippled by the interpretation placed upon the healy clause cheers by the superior courts this land act i say passed as a consequence of the giant agitation of the land league undoubtedly recognised and contained within itself the principles which the land league was founded to carry out let me remind you what these principles were referring for a moment to the constitution of the land league i find that the two main planks in the platform of that constitution were firstly the abolition of rack renting eviction and landlord oppression and secondly that every tenant farmer should be enabled to become owner of his holding upon fair terms both of these principles are contained in the land act of subject to qualifications the very important and almost fatal qualifications i have just alluded to in the session of and you have again a further advance some of the impediments in the way of an occupying ownership were removed while the first legislative sanction was given to the principle of the migration of the irish people from congested districts to other less populous portions as opposed to the principle of emigration of the irish people out of ireland cheers and in addition an attempt has been made to secure decent holdings for that long suffering and deserving class the labourers of ireland cheers and although in this last regard unforeseen obstacles have intervened so far that but little practical good has been done as regards result yet i trust this session we will be able to have legislation which will obtain some fairer and better treatment of the irish labourer cheers so far as we have gone this session although not a very brilliant one is promising good and we hope and that hope has been much deepened by recent events that before long over of the men of ireland who have been kept outside the gates of the constitution may receive the franchise and may be in a position to aid effectively the rest of their countrymen in regaining national rights for their country neither am i altogether without hope that some further advance may be made this session in reference to the land question cheers now sir i think i have given some reasons why at all events we should not be discouraged why we should have every confidence that we are upon the right track and that the principles and methods of action which have been adopted by the people and their representatives during the last few years are well calculated to attain the end we have in view underlined it is necessary me us at the same time to take advantage of this occasion to warn you against elements of future difficulty elements of possible future difficulty and possibilities of grave disunion in our ranks which may be obviated by my timely declaration underlined i refer to the project termed the nationalisation of land and in dealing with this question i don't wish to intrude upon anything of a personal character i prefer as i have always done in public life and history to deal with principles and not with men hear hear i have read for you the two planks of the platform of the land league the destruction of rack rents and of landlord oppression and evictions of the facilitation of the occupying ownership by the tiller of the soil well unmindful of this fact underlined we have been recently informed upon distinguished authority at a meeting in dublin that we have been false to the spirit of the land league that we are unmindful of its principles because we refused to desert that which has been our programme up to the present moment and to follow this new craze underlined ownership of land by anybody we are told is theft whether that anybody be landlord or tenant it is equally a crime and a robbery and because we refuse to agree with this sweeping assertion we are condemned as slack and as yielding basely to the present coercion act applause the desire to acquire land is everywhere one of the strongest instincts of human nature and that instinct is never stronger and never more developed than in a country such as ireland where land is limited and those who desire to acquire it are numerous in number i submit further that this desire to acquire landed property and the further desire to be released from the crushing impositions of rack rents was the very basis and foundation of the movement of the national league and that without it although not solely owing to it they never could have progressed or been successful as reasonably might they have supposed that they could have persuaded the poor man that it was with him a crime to endeavour to hope for the ownership of the holding he tilled underlined no more absurd or preposterous proposition was ever made to a people than after having declared on a thousand platforms by a million of voices that the tenant should be the owner of his holding that after this declaration had been agreed to by a million of our countrymen in england america and australia after having with unexampled success proceeded forward on these lines for five years we should quietly turn round retrace our steps to the starting post and commence anew a movement which should be wanting in every element and prospect of success and of the successful working of which even its supporters could not afford us any single example applause sir i say possible disunion might arise out of this new movement this new policy and programme i don't think it is at all likely there may be a design to forge out of the newly enfranchised artisans and working men of the towns and cities of ireland a sort of battering ram to propel against the tenant farmers underlined but i am confident that if any such design of that kind exists there is far too much patriotism amongst the artisans and working men of ireland to allow our movement to be stranded and that the artisan or factory hand would prefer to see his own interest sink to the dust rather than that he should for a single moment paralyse the force and the strength of his country cheers now sir this doctrine is even in the eyes of its most ardent supporters so utterly devoid of any hope of success so entirely destitute of any attraction that it is necessary to invest it with something which does not exclusively belong to it underlined and the cry of no compensation to the landlords has been raised underlined now sir i think i can more particularly speak on this matter because i have been entirely consistent upon it from the beginning i have neither advanced nor receded from the position which i took up in cheers it was a position which i thought you would be able to carry upon every platform in this country or in america underlined i laid down the principle of purchase at a fair and reasonable and what people in those days would have considered a low price underlined i said in new york in when i landed there what i say to you to night underlined that you must either pay for the land or fight for it loud cheers underlined there is no use in thinking that you can get it for nothing by talking about it on any number of platforms you must either pay for it or fight for it and in the land league deliberately adopted the principle of payment as being most likely to be the cheapest in the long run and possibly the most successful laughter i admit as i admitted then that the amount to be paid was a matter for considerable discussion and arrangement and negotiation and even agitation constitutional agitation and organisation can do a great deal to whittle down the price that the landlord asks for his land but it must be paid for unless you adopt the other alternative which i say nothing about laughter and cheers we are told of some great wave of english democracy which is now to come over here to poor ireland and assist the irish democracy cheers the poor irish democracy will have i fear to rely upon themselves in the future as they have had to do up to the present moment hear hear i have not seen any evidence of this movement which has started in england the hard question of ireland must be settled by the irish people at home applause by their own exertions and by the exertions of those men whom they depend upon in the house of commons if it is to be settled at all now sir there is another point i have explained to you that i believe this new movement is hopeless and one impossible of success it possibly may tend to disunion in our ranks but i have another and greater reason which has always influenced me in my action upon the land question underlined in my judgment the irish land question if it is to be settled by constitutional means will have to be settled before the national question can be settled by constitutional means underlined i do not express any opinion as to whether either of these questions is likely to be or can be settled by constitutional means but my proposition is this that the irish land question must be settled before the national question if constitutional measures are adopted hear hear and why is this carry your mind back to the history of the two great national movements since the union the history of the repeal agitation and the history of the home rule agitation both of those movements proceeded on the basis of an attempt to conciliate the landlords and that attempt proved equally futile in each case the landlords of ireland will have to be got rid of before we can hope to unite north and south catholic and protestant in such a way as to present our demands for national self government constitutionally in an overwhelming fashion in the english parliament great cheering as long as you have owners of land et hoc genus omne men like lord crichton deluding their unfortunate countrymen into the belief that the size and the weight of the landlord person such as they is a vital necessity in order to maintain the freedom of the protestant religion in ireland you cannot do this cheers that has been the principle upon which we have proceeded we appeared to lay aside all reference to the home rule movement in the last four years the word was never used we appeared to have simply turned ourselves into so many land reformers and that was made the occasion for complain and carping against us more than once well sir why did we do this because i believe that if this irish land question was once definitely settled upon a certain sure foundation and upon an immovable one underlined and it is very far from being so very far from being so settled at present underlined there should be no class interest in ireland of sufficient strength capable of offering an obstacle to the triumphant march of our people towards national self government and we have proceeded upon that assumption no sir i don't mean to say that the price of land has touched bottom in ireland as yet or anything like it but i do ask the people of ireland as rational beings not to be turned aside from the idea they have followed and followed successfully for the years of the land league agitation underlined not to be turned aside to the pursuit of a will of the wisp which is an impossibility and which may lead to serious disunion and which undoubtedly will postpone the settlement of the land question and make the heart grow sick regarding the probability of the restoration of an irish parliament cheers underlined i would ask the tenant farmers of ireland to turn to another part of my subject and to consider how they are likely to be affected when the labourers obtain the vote i would ask each tenant farmer to reflect whether he has altogether treated his labourers as he thinks he would like to have treated them if he knew they were going to be entitled to equal constitutional power with himself i believe the tenant farmers to be a very important class upon their courage probity and patriotism much of the future of ireland depends recollect this in a very short time these labourers who some of you show you think so little of will have equal rights with yourselves in the ballot box underlined and now is the time before they have a right to your consideration now is the time for you to refrain from obstructing the working of that important measure the labourers act underlined i think it would not be to your interest or to the cause of ireland that this important though long suffering and badly treated class should be further neglected cheers now let me ask you another question a great movement for a revival of home industry originated a year or two ago in ireland how are you supporting that movement at the present moment how many of you in any of your occupations wear some article of irish manufacture what have each of you done to provide employment in the mills at home this is a matter which should be always present to our mind we may have to pay a little more for blarney or navan tweed but its wear will abundantly recompense us in the end it is possible for each of us whether man or woman or child to do something to afford employment to irishmen or irishwomen at home and i would entreat of you to consider that in the absence of a parliament such as that which is enjoyed in australia and endowed with a power to protect native manufactures it is in our hopes that a very little self sacrifice to day will restore the ancient fame of ireland as a manufacturing nation applause the political situation is undoubtedly full of encouragement and of hope we have a people who in the face of every discouragement and disadvantage have gradually forced their way up until their attitude has come to be regarded by both friend and foe alike as sound their position is impregnable if you have progressed with a limited suffrage and in the face of the worst coercion acts ever inflicted upon a country what will you not do when coercion has been blotted out hear hear and when you have the security which will enable you to press on for the liberty and security of our country applause mr parnell m p in proposing the health of the mayor of drogheda said he esteemed it as most fortunate that the freedom of the borough should have been conferred on him while the municipality was presided over by their present mayor cheers as regards the public importance of the presence of their chief magistrate it was a matter which had been alluded to agare sic and again during the course of the day proceedings and he did not wish to enlarge upon it but it was remarkable that these years these times had undoubtedly produced more than one man amongst the magistrates or chief magistrates of irish municipalities who had been worthy of the times and the occasion cheers\n",

      "mr parnell m p who was received with waving hats and cheering renewed again and again said he regretted that he had not had an earlier opportunity to thank them for the distinguished honour which they had conferred upon him in electing him at a moment notice as the representative of their noble county cheers this delay on his part had not been wilful it had arisen from causes connected with the public service elsewhere and he was sure they would therefore readily excuse him they knew also that two other great constituencies in ireland had conferred upon him a similar honour the county of meath and the city of cork cheers to the county of meath he was under special obligations it was the first constituency which elected him and so enabled him to devote himself to the cause of his country it had also placed him at the head of the poll on the other hand he also felt that that county had special claims upon him from a personal point of view mayo was the birthplace of the great land movement which had since swept like an ocean wave over ireland there he learned his first practical lesson in the irish land question and mayo was the county which stood by him and followed out the teachings which they taught the people of ireland last spring but he was sure that they would agree with him that in approaching the consideration the question as to which constituency he should sit for they and he ought to be guided by motives of the public good no personal motives no local considerations ought to come between them and a conclusion which would be for the general good of the whole country if he were to consult his own prosonal sic feelings he confessed he should prefer the safe seat of meath or mayo rather than the troublous sic waters of rebel cork laughter but they could not as he had said look at these matters only from a personal point of view and all his friends in cork all those best acquainted with the situation in that constituency assured him that if retired from cork the magnificent victory that they had won there the result of that victory over both whig and tory would be lost and that a whig or a tory would assuredly represent that city what was he to do under these circumstances he wished to rely on the support and patriotism of the counties of meath and mayo and he wished to ask them to leave him free to act as he might be advised in the interests of the public good cries of certainly a voice please yourself and you will please us another voice send us nelson cheers a third voice no dictation from any man mr parnell the resolution he had to propose was in the following terms that we hail with the utmost satisfaction the overthrow of the late government and regard the defeat of the landlord candidates as the general election as heralding the proximate downfall of irish landlordism and the establishment of a national propriety for ireland the freeman journal italics in its issue of saturday commenced a leader on this subject in the following way we have no desire to appear antagonistic to those land reformers who dream that it is possible at a single sweep to buy out all the landlords in the county and resell their estates to the tenants the freeman journal italics in supposing that this sentence conveyed generally the programme of the land league made not for the first time a mistake with regard to their programme their aims and objects and the means by which they sought to carry out those aims and objects they did not desire to buy out at a single sweep all the landlords in the country and resell their estates to tenants at twenty years purchase of the government valuation or at any other valuation and there was not a shadow of foundation in any resolution passed at the land conference the other day which could convey such an impression the programme of the national land league had been to a great extent and would be to effect a reduction in the rack rents which were pressing upon the tenantry of ireland and driving them into starvation and he would point out that the freeman journal italics which now gave them such very excellent advice had from the very commencement impeded and obstructed the national land league in carrying out this object he could recollect that the land meeting of which this was the anniversary and the subsequent meeting at westport at which he first appeared and taught them to hold a firm grip upon their holdings cheers were denounced in the leading articles of this same freeman journal italics as communistic cries of down with the whig freeman italics and furthermore in addition to the reduction of rents for the tenantry which he said they had been successful in obtaining wherever the tenantry of ireland had had the courage to follow their advice they desired to bring about a gradual transfer of the land of ireland to the tenant farmers of ireland they believed that the people of a country should own the land but they had never said that they were willing that the tenantry should give at one sweep twenty years purchase on the government valuation for their holdings that would be forecasting the future in a way that no man and nobody had a right to forecast it who could tell that the land of ireland next year or the year after that would be worth years purchase of the valuation hear hear a few years ago land was selling in the landed estates court at an average of ½ years purchase of the rental the rental on an average being about or percent over the government valuation to day land could not be sold in some places at years purchase of the rental cheers and hear hear and it would be a folly and madness for any man to recommend the tenant farmers of ireland as a mass to give years purchase of the government valuation to day for their lands hear hear now they had recommended as one of the means to effect a gradual transfer of the land of this country to those who tilled it and as a further means of obtaining an abatement of rack rents which would press upon many parts of this country the appointment by the government of a commission with power to do certain things power to improve and carry out the bright clauses of the land act power to the department to acquire the ownership of any estate upon tendering to the owner thereof a sum equal to years of the poor law valuation of such estate and to let said estate to the tenants at a rent equal to ½ per cent of the purchase money thereof the speaker continued this is the clause which has evidently misled the freeman journal italics but this clause does not contemplate a wholesale purchase of the land of ireland by this department upon these terms by no means it contemplates that this commission shall be empowered to purchase those estates where landlords were rack renting their tenants to acquire those estates at twenty years purchase of the valuation and to put in the tenants either as crown tenants paying a rent of ½ per cent per annum on the purchase money or as peasant proprietors paying a rent of five per cent on the purchase money for years now he claimed and felt convinced that the appointment of a commission composed of men who meant to do right by the tenant farmers of ireland with or millions of money at their command with power to pounce down upon any rackrenting or exterminating landlord in any part of ireland and to put an end to his rights over his tenants by giving him years purchase upon the valuation was a far better means and a far more workable means for protecting the irish tenant than the cloud of legal fiction contained in the late mr butt fixity of tenure bill cheers and as for the rest this irish land question had now attained such proportions that it must be settled and it could only be settled in one way by the transfer of the land to the people who occupied it there was no other precedent for the settlement than the settlement which they proposed they had dozens of precedents in all the great european countries in the united states of america in canada and in prince edward island for the settlement which they had urged during the last twelve months and which they urged to day there was no precedent anywhere for the settlement recommended by the freeman journal italics but said the freeman journal at the end of a laborious and ungrammatical article of two columns we shall deal on some future occasion with the objections urged in the scheme under consideration to the plan of fixity of tenure laid down by mr butt we shall only at present say that we think they are capable of being met now he would remind them that these few lines were all the notice devoted by this newspaper to the grave and fatal objections which had been urged against mr butt bill and that it was fully ten days since those objections were first published and if the freeman journal italics really believed what it said in the tail of this article that they thought these objections were capable of being met he said they would have adopted a far more sensible course in devoting these two long columns of a leader to meeting these objections rather than in putting forward objections to their plan which had no foundation whatever in fact hear hear and which were based entirely upon a false hypothesis twelve months ago he said in the county mayo that the settlement of this land question would depend mainly upon the courage and determination of the people themselves hear hear he said that in far darker days than the present time with government reporters at his elbow taking down every word that he uttered and every exclamation that was made by the people in response with famine fast coming upon the people of ireland and with apparently no help from the responsible promoters of the famine they had appealed to the government of england they had told them the state of the case and in response to their cry for work and for bread the government sent them police bayonets police buts and extra taxes to pay for these men groans now they were not afraid then with this dark prospect before them to exhibit some courage and determination and those of them who followed the advice given and kept sufficient money out of their rents to feed themselves their wives and children during the winter were not compelled to sink to the degraded level of pauperism hear hear if under these circumstances with this dark prospect before them they had courage and determination enough to stand by their rights surely when the sun was rising on their land when there was a prospect of emerging from the clouds which had beset them so long surely they would now with the goal almost within sight be as brave as they were twelve months ago hear hear surely they would to day renew the pledge which they made twelve months ago upon those historic plains that they would keep a firm grip on their holdings that they would refuse to pay any unjust rent and that they would stand by this struggle until the land of the country had passed into the possession of the people of the country hear hear if they did this to day he could promise them victory hear hear the irish national land league was known all over the world australia america canada were pouring money into their coffers to help their defence of the tenant farmers of ireland cheers they would give the people millions to break down this land system hear hear but let them not attempt to pay unjust rents this coming summer and autumn and compel the league again to appear as beggars for them in all parts of the world for charity hear hear they were willing to send the league money to help people in this fight but they thought that the people should do something for themselves that they should not wilfully plunge themselves into poverty and famine by continuing to pay those rack rents cries of no we will not and this was a reasonable position they had taken up the land of ireland was amply sufficient to feed all her population but if the people persisted in ending every ready penny they had in selling all the food of the country to procure that ready penny and in sending all their money out of the country to support the landlords in luxury they could not in future expect the sympathies of the civilised world hear hear but he was sure that warned by the teaching of the past they would renew their determination to stand by their rights it was impossible for even the tenant farmers of a single county to be thrust out if they combined together the league would protect the tenants in the courts by fighting points of law cheers and out of the courts by creating an irresistible public sentiment against the landlord exterminators who might venture to trespass on their rights and if by chance in any place a landlord should get the upper hand of a tenant they would see that a better and happier home was provided for him to take the place of that he had lost but in order to do all this they must take the advice of the league they must stand firm they must give good notice whenever anyone of them was threatened with eviction or disturbance from his holding and above all things they must form local organisations which would be able to investigate these cases and to see how and in what direction the exertions of the land league might be best applied up to the time of going to press we had not received the conclusion of the above report\n",

      "mr parnell m p in proposing that we hereby endorse the programme of land reform for ireland which has been prepared by the national land league and adopted at the conference of land reformers held in dublin on thursday last and pledge ourselves to do all in our power to have that programme applied to the amelioration of the agricultural and industrial classes of our country said in conclusion it is impossible for the six hundred thousand tenant farmers to be overwhelmed if they combine together it is impossible for even the tenant farmers of a single county to be thrust out if they combine together we will protect you in the courts by fighting points of law cheers out of the courts by creating a public sentiment an irresistible public sentiment against the landlord exterminators who may venture to trespass on your rights and if by chance in any place the landlord should get the upper hand of his tenant we will see that a better and a happier home is provided him in place of that he has lost but in order to do all this you must take our advice you must stand firm you must give good notice whenever any one of you is threatened with eviction or disturbance from his holding and above all things you must form local organisations which will be able to investigate these cases and to see how and in what direction the exertions of the land league may be best applied i leave this cause then for it is your own cause confidently in your hands believing that the spirit of the county mayo has not been deteriorated by the suffering of last winter and that we are commencing a renewal of agitation on this land question of tenfold great intensity than that which has signalised the past winter cheers\n",

      "he said fellow countrymen and people of kerry allow me to congratulate you upon this magnificent meeting it is the largest meeting which i have had the honour of attending since in the county of mayo cheers for mayo just twelve months ago we initiated the movement at irishtown which will sweep the feudal stem of landlordism from its hollow basis in this country i have also to apologise to you for keeping you for two long hours a voice you are welcome mr parnell after the time announced for this meeting to commence i can only say that circumstances connected with the public service prevented me from appearing any sooner and no one felt greater annoyance than i did myself at being so late now the people of ireland are engaged at the present time in a great movement perhaps the greatest or one of the greatest undertakings that any nation could engage in the task of obtaining for our people the land of their native country cheers such is a task worthy of the energies of our people you have struggled right nobly in the past but in this great work you have been beset by difficulties and dangers of no ordinary character here an attempt was made by some persons on the platform to remove head constable doherty of killarney who was taking notes of mr parnell speech the interuption sic caused by the proceeding which was unsuccessful lasted for some minutes mr parnell on resuming said the laws the landlords made gave them the right to exact any rent that they please to seize the food upon which the tenant has to depend for his existence in satisfaction of that rent and finally to drive out the tenant from his holding if he fails or is incapable to pay that rent these laws are unjust and although our members of parliament can do and will do a great deal to alter them depend upon it that you can do a great deal the power of organisation amongst the people is immense there are six hundred thousand tenant farmers in ireland there are ten thousand landlords and i say that no law can give the ten thousand landlords a right to rack rent and drive from their homes these six hundred thousand tenant farmers cheers now there has been a dispute or rather a difference of opinion as to the ultimate way in which this land question must be settled we believe that the land question will never be settled so long as the institution of landlordism survives in ireland cheers you may patch and cobble the system as you please but you will never make it anything but a bad system and it is your duty in laying down the lines for settlement of this question to see that those lines are laid on right and on true and not false foundations cheers we have put our demands before the english nation and we shall assuredly put them before the english parliament we shall point out that in no other country save in england scotland and ireland has this feudal system of landlordism survived and we shall ask what steps shall be taken to abolish it in ireland cheers it is exceedingly likely that as in the past something else which we have not asked for will be offered us in settlement of the question hints have been already thrown out that mr gladstone is going to extend the ulster custom to the rest of ireland a voice it would not be bad now mr parnell i shall not object to such a measure while at the same time we cannot accept it as a final solution of the irish land question cheers the ulster custom is good where the tenant has property in the land is protecting that property in a series of years the ulster custom would undoubtedly create a proprietary for the tenant but if a period of depression comes the property of the tenants is no longer protected we see that by the example of the north of ireland where the tenant right of the tenant has disappeared in the face of the bad times and where the tenants are groaning just as loudly and as much as you are groaning under the oppressive and rack rents which have been inflicted on you we must have then some temporary measure which will prevent the eviction of the smaller classes of the tenantry and we must have some measure which taking a general average on the government valuation the only standard of rent which is afforded to us will prevent the landlords from exacting upon any holding any higher rent than such government valuation cheers in proposing that eviction should be suspended for a period of two years in holdings valued at under we have been charged with a desire to confiscate the rent of the landlord for two years but we will leave the landlord for two years but we will leave the landlord many other ways of recovering as the tradesman has for debts we will put him in the same position as the banks and shopkeeping class of the country if the legislature refuses to do cheers we have recommended amongst other things that a commission should be appointed with powers of compulsory expropriations in certain cases some people have said that we ought to expropriate absentee landlords and london companies corporations drawing vast revenues from ireland and returning nothing is correct but at the same time i cannot help saying that many of the absentee landlords and some of the london companies own the lower rented estates in ireland and i should prefer to see a measure of compulsory expropriation first sanctioned in the case of rack renting landlords i would empower the government commission to give every rack renting landlord in ireland or the most rack renting amongst the number twenty years purchase of the government valuation and i believe that if such a law were enacted and eight or ten millions of money given to this commission you would see rents in ireland coming down at such a run as has never entered the mind of men at the present moment mr parnell urged them to organise themselves against the oppressive land law as the day was dawning when they would have taken the first step to strike down british misrule in ireland when the dreams of grattan of emmet of fitzgerald and of every patriotic irishmen at all times would be brought to a triumphant realisation cheers he concluded by proposing the following resolution that in the opinion of this meeting the eviction of occupiers of land for non payment of a rent arbitrarily fixed by the landlord is unjust subversive of the true interests of the country and calls for the emphatic condemnation of all lovers of justice\n",

      "referring to the question whether the farmers should give evidence before the land commission mr parnell said that his opinion decidedly was that whatever harm they may do to the cause by going before the commission they will certainly be able to do it no good speaking on the subject of landgrabbing he used the following words what are you to do to a tenant who bids for a farm from which his neighbour was evicted shouts and cries of kill him shoot him now i think i heard somebody say shoot him but i wish to point out to you a very much better way a more christian and a more charitable way which will give the lost sinner an opportunity of repenting you must show him when you meet him in the streets of the town at the shop counter in the fair or market place and even in the house of worship by leaving him severly sic alone by putting him into a moral coventry by isolating him as if he was a leper of old and you may depend upon it that if the population of a county in ireland carry out this doctrine there will be no man as to dare public opinion and transgress your unwritten code of laws cheers how would the english government like it if some day we told the people not to pay any rent until this land question was settled we have not told them that yet if it should not be settled it will be for wiser heads than mine whether we shall not be obliged to tell the people of ireland to strike against all rent until the question has been settled and if the tenant farmers struck against the landlords i should like to see where they would get police and soldiers enough to preserve the peace cheers\n",

      "fellow countrymen and american citizens it is very gratifying to me to see here to night such an inspiring object as a body of irishmen armed and disciplined as men should be applause this is a right that should never be denied but which the legislature of england our oppressor has taken from us and which too is the cause of hundreds of ireland children rushing madly on the points of english bayonets thank god my dear friends that such a sight as this i have lived to see applause thank god for such freedom and may god in his kindness grant that we may yet see ireland great and glorious like your own great america loud applause mr chairman ladies and gentlemen you have done me far too much honour both by the cordiality of your reception and by the character of your address i claim to be nothing but a very humble worker in the national ranks who desires to do his best to forward the great movement which is now progressing in ireland applause since my arrival in this country i regret to say that a lurid light has been thrown upon that movement the cable yesterday evening flashed to us the news that the british government unable to deal with us unable to cope with the strength of public opinion in that country unable to check and control the movement which is about to sweep away the infamous system has resorted to its old policy of massacre and violence hisses in galway county the police the guardians of order in their country hisses have been the first to violate law and order and to fire upon a peaceable crowd hisses we read that a woman has been the first victim of the courage of these soldiers of great britain hisses now ladies and gentlemen such occurrences show us how terrible must be the situation in ireland these events were brought about by the determination of the landlords to drive the people from their homes and to use the armed force of power for that purpose these poor peasants i suppose came to the conclusion that a quick and speedy death upon the bayonets of the troops was better than the slow and lingering torture of cold and starvation because picture to yourselves what an eviction means it means that the house of the unhappy being is forcibly broken into the furniture the little humble furniture demolished by sledge hammers the roof torn from over the head of young and old alike the father the mother the child even the presence of death does not avail to postpone this terrible trial and frightful moment well thrust out from their homes at this time in the middle of winter with no food to eat what resource is there before the peasant of the west what better resource than that fate that they have met even yesterday i confess ladies and gentlemen although i am not an advocate of violence although i am no advocate of physical resistance against the force the overwhelming force the force which england can bring to bear against us in ireland yet at the same time such deeds as those of which we have heard are enough to stir the heart of the most patient people to physical violence applause great attempts have been made from time to time by the english press to represent the state of ireland as being most disorderly and lawless at the present moment they have told you of atrocities that have been committed by the tenant farmers they have told you of landlords who have been shot of cattle that have been disabled but they have never ventured to substantiate any such assertion by naming any particular instance and now we find that during the course of this great movement which has been marked by the most extraordinary forbearance on the part of the people we find that the british government is the first to shed blood there has been during the eight months that this agrarian movement has lasted there has been no bloodshed there has been no outrage there has no sic been violence until yesterday when the police drew the first blood by firing on the people in the county of galway and what was the conduct of the people on that occasion the cable tells us it tells us that although they got the commanding officer of the troops into their power the were contented with disarming him and letting him go unharmed though they had seen their brothers and sisters stricken down murdered i say it fearlessly and i shall repeat the words in the house of commons upon my return home great applause after they had approved the courage and devotion of the irish race by rushing an unarmed crowd of men and women upon the troops and taking the weapons the weapons of precision martini henry rifles with which they are armed from their hands they allowed them to retire in peace now i think this is noble conduct on the part of any people and it is conduct that deserves our recognition here in america surrounded as we are by free institutions it is hard for me to depict to you the noble attitude of these people i must leave it to you to imagine for yourselves applause now i fear that statements that i may make to night will scarcely be believed it seems so impossible so incredible that human nature could be so cruel and for so little purpose of advantage but we know that during the time of the irish famine the corn seized by the landlords for rent was burned by the landlords in the sight of the starving people the men who did such things as that will do anything what should have been the duty of the government under those circumstances with famine before us what would your government have done in this country suppose one of your western states instead of being full of plenty at this moment was devastated by famine what do you think they would have done they would have sent train loads of provisions to feed those people but instead of any such thing the british government simply send police and soldiers to shoot the people down hisses they desire to bolster up their land system they desire to help the irish landlords collect rents which are not in existence they desire to help the landlords to take the food upon which the people have to depend for their existence during the coming winter and i say that they have forfeited all claim to be considered an established government and one deserving of the respect which everybody ought to pay to an established government which seeks to maintain order in a community applause we are warring against the land system in ireland it is a system which stands self condemned by its results it is also as i hope to be able to prove an unnatural and artificial system and one which is likely even if well and properly administered to work harm now the land systems in ireland and england are very similar but the system in ireland has been very badly administered by the landlords and in england it has been very well administered and so while we work alongside the english land reformers we go a little farther than they do for we consider that the pressure is so great in ireland the evils that resulted from it are so intense that we require more radical remedies than those necessary in england we desire to make the tillers of the soil the people who cultivate it the tenant farmers we desire to make them the owners we believe that the land system which introduced a class of men between those who work the land and those who own it is an artificial and a bad system and we desire to abolish that we desire to make the people who till the ground its owners now this great reform has been carried out in other european countries in different ways you have never had the landlords in america and you may be very thankful for it and take my advice and never have any applause i am told that in the state of new york in you did have such persons as landlords and you went a great deal further than we go in your desire to get rid of them because you started an anti rent movement and said that until landlords ceased to exist as landlords in new york state no more rent should be paid and your rough and ready method was very effective and the system ceased in france the landlords were abolished by the revolution and did not get a penny for compensation and a good many of them were hung up to a lamp post applause mr parnell next referred to the abolition of the system in prussia and then explained his plans in much the same language as that used at madison square garden on sunday night the bright clauses in the land act by which the government had been authorised to loan to tenants wishing to buy up a foreclosed estate two thirds of the purchase money was practically inoperative but the result of the present agitation had been to make it available and to enable farmers to buy up land on much more favourable terms than was possible before applause mr parnell then continued there has been a regular competition between the moneyed classes to attain the position of landlords we have stopped all that and if you help us we will make that stoppage a permanent one applause he then explained how he wished to raise two funds one for the relief of the destitute the other for the political organisation which is working to uproot the land system he cautioned the people not to give their money to the duchess of marlborough fund for it would only be paid to those tenants who had obediently paid the last penny for rent to their landlords you remember the last famine when the catholic who refused to change his religion was allowed to starve there were very few of them i speak as a protestant and i am thankful for it great applause if money for relief is intrusted to the hands of the english governing classes it will be inevitably used for the purpose of demoralising the people and checking our movement any money put into our hands will be distributed without distinction or creed or colour we could have obtained sufficient money for our purposes at home but the process would have been very much slower i wish to express my particular pleasure in witnessing the military display that accompanied us to the hall applause we in ireland are not permitted to carry arms if any of us keeps in his house anything more dangerous than a popgun laughter we are sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labour we are not permitted to have a single regiment of volunteers there the government knew very well that if there were irish volunteers in ireland the land system would not be in existence laughter and applause and the police and soldiers would not be allowed to shoot down women and children we ask you to help us to free ourselves from the necessity of appearing as beggars before you applause ireland is very fertile we are told that the people ought to emigrate but the people won't emigrate applause and i think they are right great applause there is plenty of land in ireland for everybody if the fertile lands were divided among the tenant farmers there would be forty acres for every farmer that is not an over abundant population it is not as much as you have in the state of massachussets sic and i am sure that its climate is not better than ours help us to abolish that system we need your moral support far more than we need any pecuniary support no irish question ever enters into the domain of practical english politics until the attention of england is forcibly drawn to the necessity of doing something looking to amelioration unhappy and terrible as has been the loss of life the day before yesterday i believe that the lives of these poor people will not have been thrown away in vain this occurrence may awaken the attention of the english people to the transaction it gives me the greatest pleasure to come to this country and see so many of my countrymen prosperous it strikes my eyes strangely to see such evidences of prosperity in this country and it only quickens my desire and firm resolve not to cease fighting until we have abolished the last relics of the irish land system which has done so much to destroy and enslave our country applause\n",

your kind permission i will read it and from it you will get the latest news of how matters are progressing at home new york jan charles s parnell at parnell meeting the following cablegram to the irish world has been received from davitt patrick ford special cable to the irish world dublin jan the conference of the home rule members of parliament in dublin yesterday was given to electioneering speeches the o'donoughue sic proposed a resolution of sympathy with the farmers of the west of ireland for their resistance to landlordism edward dwyer gray mr shaw and mitchell henry home rulers opposed the passage of the o'donoughue sic resolution but it was carried despite their opposition at a public meeting last night of the citizens of dublin a series of resolutions returning thanks to parnell and dillon for their efforts were passed unanimously and with enthusiasm a rumor whose source is the carlton club prevails that the government intend introducing a bill on the coming session of parliament on the irish land agitation mr parnell i wonder what sort of a bill that is whether a bill to suppress coercion of the tenants or furnish more bullets and guns to shoot down defenceless women i think it is rather uncertain what this is the fact but the nature is not told process serving which has created such commotion for weeks has ceased distress is extending approvals are flowing in from every direction the land league disbursed the amount received up to wednesday and is now at work distributing that received since the land league just received six thousand dollars from new york mr parnell that makes sent since i arrived in this country and i expect to send another in a few days shaw and gray and the dublin freeman journal were severely denounced at the williamston and curry meetings last sunday land league branches are rapidly extending projected anti rent meetings in south fermanagh phoenix park dublin and all through galway mayo sligo roscommon and antrim michael davitt mr parnell i have an additional cable dispatch showing that riots of frequent occurrence in ireland on one occasion the constabulary refused to fire on the peasantry etc etc but really i have said so much since i have been in this country that it seems scarcely necessary to go over the same ground again i will make however a brief recapitulation of what i have said the obnoxious land system most of you are familiar with how in ireland about persons hold the land while till it the owners live out of the country and draw annually from the country which they spend abroad this is not the only or the greatest evil ireland has to suffer from the existing land laws what is more oppressive than all is that the laws give the land owner such power that they can terminate the tenancy or raise the tent at the dictate of arbitrary will the monopoly of any article that is limited in extent where the demand is enormous must needs be oppressive so it is with the lands of ireland it is for this reason that the tenant fears to invest his earnings on the land or make any improvements thereon whenever a tenant beautifies or improve sic his small patch of land then so certain does the landlord raise the rent i know it for a fact that the average rental in ireland is fifty per cent over the valuation placed by the government on the land for the purposes of taxation in many cases it is from to per cent over this valuation in addition to the rack rents the uncertainty of tenure you can readily see is terrible to the impoverished tenant in the first place the land is of that nature that it requires to be cultivated very carefully properly drained and properly cared for before it can be brought to a respectable state of cultivation hence this oppressive system which does not give security to the tenant is a direct barrier to the improvement of the land not one third of the crops that might be raised even in a prosperous season are consequently the result of the tenant tillage then when every ten or twenty years bring their season of entire failure of the crops famine spreads over the country destroying millions of people the system created for the benefit of the few destroys the many the movement now on foot in ireland and for which we are laboring is to arrange the settlement of this question justly and humanely we are told that we have no precedent for urging our demands i think the example of prussia would not be amiss for the queen of england to follow in treating the tenants properly in the matter of the land question in after the commission of the peace of then it was that the prussian government having settled its affairs of war turned its attention to the suffering tenantry when the king saw how his subjects were disconcerted he asked his celebrated prime minister stein what he should do to make his people prosperous and contented the advice was immediately given to first abolish the nefarious land system and the ownership was transferred to the tenant to day great britain and ireland are the only countries on the globe where this land system exists all others have abolished the system entirely the way in which the king of prussia transferred the ownership of the lands to the tenants furnishes a very high historical precedent for our action in ireland the result in that country was for the benefit of the whole people the speaker then read the edict of the king of prussia relative to the land question in that country showing how it regulated the manner in which the landlords and tenants should come together and regulate their difficulties he then continued this same kind of movement is now going on in ireland i suppose in other words an effort is being made to make the tenant have some interest in the ownership of the land in prussia now the tenants are all owners of farms in and the obnoxious system in that country ceased and it was considered advisable that it should cease the same precedent might be found in russia they tell me that the russian tenants were serfs and the irish tenants are not if the irish tenants are not worse than serfs then i do not know what they are i know that there has been many a time in the days of famine and oppression that the irish peasant would be glad to accept the condition of the russian serf each serf was allowed land at a small rent the czar deemed that the proper way to bring the oppression to an end decreed that the state should advance money to help them in their difficulty the tenants might buy in the property by paying for it on sixteen years time in the bright clauses were proposed for the benefit of ireland they were very imperfect but they prepared the way for reformation by them certain annual payments extended over a period of thirty five years were provided for at the end of which period payment was to come we want to go farther now it is true the landlord wanted to hold his land in ireland in the face of the radical work going on there for the relief of the oppressed we demand the compulsory attention of the landlord to this crying evil i am glad however to see john bright is coming over to our side the right side on the land question i am glad to see that he is coming around to believe that the tenants ought to own the soil they labor so hard to till i will now read a cable received from london to day john bright suggestions london jan john bright at birmingham saturday suggested that parliament appoint a commission to go to dublin with power to sell farms of landlords to tenants willing to buy and to advance three fourth of the purchase money principal and interest to be paid in thirty five years such a measure bright believed would meet the desire of the irish people the commission should assist the tenant to purchase whenever the landlord was willing to sell he recommended compulsory sale only where the land was owned by london companies as is the case with large tracts near londonderry he expressed the conviction that if his plan was ever adopted the self interest or public opinion would soon compel individual landlords to sell to the tenants yes ladies and gentlemen i am glad to see that john bright is coming around to our view but he will have to go farther than this before we can accept his proposals he wants to appoint a government commission to go to dublin and sell the landlords lands to the tenants at three forths sic advance to be repaid in thirty five years in annual instalments he recommends compulsory sale when the owners are london companies as is the case with large tracts of land near londonderry i would call to his mind that nearly all the fertile lands of ireland are owned by london companies i tell you the public opinion that the land league is setting in motion will soon awake the british government to a sense of humanity and justice you must not think that bright proposition is satisfactory we cannot accept it as a solution of the irish land question we can accept no solution which does not afford every tenant in ireland the right of becoming the owner of his own farm it will have to be solved in this way no matter what concessions are made by parliament or something more radical will be received on we have proposed a peaceable and constitutional remedy for this difficulty although i am bound to admit that it is the duty of every irishman to shed the last drop of his blood in order to obtain his rights if there were a probable chance of success yet at the same time we all recognise the great responsibility of our unarmed people on the broad points of british bayonets in a useless and disastrous struggle prolonged cheers it is really difficult for the american people to realise what is being done in ireland in the name of the queen in the nineteenth century how shameful to see so many bereft of liberty under the sanction of a government that is constantly boasting of its liberty the queen forgets that her charity should commence at home i would think it be better for me in order to describe some of the horrible scenes now being enacted in my distressed country to call a witness not prejudiced in our favor i refer to the new york herald prolonged and continued hisses that journal has always taken the landlord side of this great question but it will find in winning this cause it will be a more difficult task than in searching for dr livingston sic in central africa i am sorry that any american journal should so forget itself as to take sides with despotism i remember reading in mythology of a certain person called sysiphus sic who was given an impossible to perform let me see i think i am right in the name and the story but it is so long since i have been at school that i may be incorrect really i should hate to shame my old school at cambridge by error on this occasion however i think the story ran that sysiphus sic when he was sent down to hell was given the task of rolling a stone up a hill every time he reached the top the stone would roll down and carry him with it the best thing to do with the new york herald was to send it down the infernal regions to roll the irish landlords and british government up hill so that they would keep continually tumbling down like sysiphus and the stone in the mythological story cheers and hisses i will now read from the columns of the herald what its special correspondent said of the eviction of families in connemara the terrors of which were stopped by the gallantry of the unarmed peasantry of the west cheers the article went on to relate how the police charged with fixed bayonets wounding several defenceless women up to the time of the shedding of blood the men had not interfered and no missiles were thrown the processes were taken from the agent and then it was that a mrs mackeel lifted a piece of blazing turf and hit one of the hireling police a severe blow on the head three cheers for mackeel the cheers at mr parnell request were given by the immense audience with a vim that awoke the hall to the echo give the sod of turf another cheer three more more sic cheers were given while the officer was smarting from the burning turf and perhaps he was not the first man made to smart by a woman laughter he drew his sword and violently assaulted the brave woman while such a spirit of resistance remains hope of liberty will cling around it mr parnell then read another heartrending account of an eviction in the western part of ireland from a herald correspondent and wondered why it was that from the many facts in the columns of that journal about unhappy ireland it still should be the organ of the irish landlord in this country he told of the scenes of riot the serving of processes was bringing about he had just heard of a case where the land agent had gone out with evictions to serve and only served one he then told the story of a poor peasant the rent of whose patch of land was double the government valuation for the support of himself and family during the winter he had but a barrel and a half of potatoes yet amid all the darkness thrown around him he still was wont to say to the speaker let us hope there a good time coming mr parnell then concluded his address as follows ladies and gentlemen i owe you an apology for detaining you so long although i always feel justified in detaining my countrymen in speaking of the cause of ireland i would like to refer you to the action of the dublin mansion house committee that is now pretending to being doing good for the suffering people its chairman is the lord mayor of dublin this is the new york herald committee for the relief of distressed irish landlords hisses there is not a single tenant allowed to take part in this movement the mansion house committee have organised no one who has not paid his rent in full can get any benefit from their work it is entirely a landlord committee mr parnell then read the names of all those composing this committee and gave a scathing account of how each one life record had always been opposed to the poor peasantry of their country one sir arthur grimes was a tory leader of the most pronounced type one who had wealth enough in his pocket to help every starving man in ireland another member came from the speaker own county wicklow he was the most bigoted anti catholic in ireland this man was lord lieutenant of wicklow and in order to prevent a catholic from being appointed to a magistracy he got a friend to write to the speaker who was a protestant asking that he allow his name to go in for appointment a voice when you go home put him out great laughter and cheers the there was hon david plunkett the chief supporter of the obnoxious irish land system this mansion house committee should endeavour to compel the government to come to the aid of the people not to the assistance of the landlords at the mention of such of the committeemen and the remarks about them the audience indulged in prolonged hisses mr parnell then said again i find myself at a concluding point i know that the intelligence of this audience and of other meetings we have attended will give great encouragement to the cause we are advocating what is required is that the british government should be shamed the public opinion of this country is the great instrument in affecting this the bare admission on the part of high english officials that there is distress in ireland is one great step towards eventual success up to the time when america took notice of the famishing condition of ireland the british government denied that there was trouble there that the people were starving i tell you my friends if the people of ireland are to be murdered we will not have it done secretly the assassins will have to do their dark deeds publicly and our agitation will see that the people are properly informed on these matters besides the moral power which america will give ireland by sympathy expressed in this country there will be brought about a great reformation in all that is good in that country when that time comes it may not come in our day but certain it will come when ireland will be able to take her place among the independent nations of the world you ladies and gentlemen you the people of america will have the satisfaction of knowing that your voice was cast for ireland and on the side of suffering humanity your sympathy in her days of distress will be remembered by her sons when they are freemen and may god grant that the time will not be far distant when free ireland will have an opportunity to thank you for the part you have taken in this great work\n",

      "mr parnell began by expressing himself as sincerely grateful for his cordial reception although he knew that it was not accorded to him personally but to the cause he represented it would be his duty to give some general information respecting the irish land question however well the subject may be understood we want to create a public opinion he said that will shame the british government into equitable relations with ireland i have found many hopeful signs since my coming to america the young men and women born of irish parents in this country seem to out irish the irish in their sympathy and feeling for the land from which their fathers have been driven we have at home a fertile soil and a genial climate unsurpassed by any in the world and yet we are always in a chronic state of poverty poverty which in other countries would be termed starvation if for any cause the crops fail for a single season we are plunged at once into a famine in hundreds of thousands died from starvation and the rest of the inhabitants of the infected district were driven from the country the policy of england towards us has been one of secrecy concealment and stealth that famine was not known in america till it had been going on for two years and people had suffered from it this time we thought it best to warn america that the trouble was coming and the result i am happy to say has been satisfactory both in america and england i can assure you also that the first force of the famine is broken the deaths from starvation which were so enormous during the first week after our landing here are diminishing in number the greatest feat of all is that we have accomplished so much here that the british government is actually showing signs of commencing to pretend to do something for the suffering of ireland it will find it necessary to make more of a pretense sic before the matter is completed i have been asked said mr parnell by the republican to the extent of the famine when i came to this country my estimate was that people would be destitute of food by the middle or last of february since then the new york herald has put the number at and i am inclined to make it there is destitution all over the island except in some of the cities of the north but the people who are famishing belong to the seven western counties donegal mayo galway kerry sligo cork and clare although some of them have districts which are comparatively free from suffering of course it would be impossible for american charity to feed all this host but much may be done to alleviate suffering till parliament meets and sets the necessary machinery in motion for their relief we charge this famine directly on the irish land tenure system which is patterned after the old feudal system and has been driven from every country in europe but england and ireland because of this system ireland produces only about a third of what it would if properly cultivated but some people say that our famines are due solely to our crowded population they remind me of the man who was trying to sell and horse and called the attention of the buyer to his tail instead of his teeth the most unproductive parts of ireland are crowded because the tenant farmers were driven off the acres of fertile lands by the famine of and those of them who remained in the country settled in unproductive regions reclaiming small acre farms for themselves leaving the region of their former homes to remain tenantless and uncultivated as soon as the new lands became productive the landlords demanded rent which was increased from year to year until the american competition in beef and mutton sprang up when they became unbearable and have since been resisted and in most cases abated or per cent there is good land enough in ireland to give every farmer acres and it is absurd to talk of a crowded population when if the island were properly cultivated it would support people instead of the fertile part should be re peopled and there should be an emigration from west to east i object said the speaker to having our people shoveled sic out in disgrace as paupers from their native land to these shores with so little money that they cannot strike for the west and buy them farms as the germans do but are compelled to remain in the populous east and earn a precarious living as day laborers each family should be able to carry with it at least and yet mr vere foster has offered me to take people from the west of ireland about apiece mr parnell went on to say that he and his party propose to have every tenant farmer own his farm and that the rights of the people are of quite as much consequence as those of property we suggest said he a plan by which the tenants shall come into possession of the land after paying a fair rental for years which is similar to the proposition made at birmingham saturday that a commission be appointed to arrange for the sale of lands between tenants and owners either by a partial payment down and subsequent rentals or be a rental for years the present rental is per cent above the government valuation for taxation in conclusion mr parnell paid his respects to randolph churchill so of the duke of marlborough who has just cabled the statement that his assertion that the duchess of marlborough fund is being used for sectarian purpose is false and referred to the fact that churchill descended from the notorious sarah jennings and arabella churchill and quoted macaulay concerning those individuals also to the dublin mansion house committee who are in a fume because of what he has said about them\n",

      "mr chairman ladies and gentlemen i am glad to see this magnificent meeting it is a grand augury and will give renewed hope to our people in ireland now so terribly oppressed to learn that the good people of toledo have with such enthusiasm manifested their sympathy the new york herald says that there are too many people in ireland that they can't live there and advises the tenants to come over to america and get acres a piece that journal is engaged to defend the irish landlords and a bad job it has got on its hands laughter and hisses great britain is the only country where the feudal system still retains all of its most brutal properties many of you are from ireland and will understand what a burning question this matter of the land agitation in ireland is it may seem extraordinary to americans inhabiting a country where land is so very plentiful that this irish land question should be the cause of so much feeling and animosity and that there should be such a constant struggle between the tenants who occupy the land and the landlords who own it you have here boundless tracts of land and you say why don't you come out here and we will give you as much land as you want for nothing a great many of us have come from time to time i suppose ireland has sent away more people in proportion to her population as emigrants than all the other european countries as emigrants than all the other european countries put together quite one third of the foreign population of this country are either irish born or are born of irish parents therefore if emigration had been sufficient to remedy the wrongs of ireland it would now be the most happy and prosperous country in the world because for the past century our people have emigrated and emigrated until it seems as if there would be nobody left to emigrate at all i wish to speak to you to night upon the land question land in ireland is held upon the system of tenure which originated with the feudal system it gives the owners of the soil the landlords the full control and gives the tenants the right to occupy the land upon the payment of a certain amount of rent it is a very uncertain tenure indeed for property like land the tenant is allowed to hold his farm upon a six months notice to quite and when it is remembered that land requires a great deal to be done to it before it can be made productive it will be seen that just when it has been made fertile by the exertions of the tenants it is liable to be taken from them in europe this system of land tenure formerly existed in every country except russia and several instances may be cited in which the land has been taken from the landlords and given to the tenants take the case of prussia in that country the feudal system has been entirely broken up in the rest of germany it has been pruned down and in italy it has been in part destroyed the reform was accomplished in prussia by an edict of the emperor frederick william under the advice of the celebrated reformer stein that edict provided that all landed property should pass from the landlords to the ownership of the tenants upon the payment of an indemnity the terms of which were set forth and two years were allowed for the landlords and tenants to settle between themselves upon the terms of surrender these two years elapsed without any such terms having been made and the state then took the matter in hand itself it issued to the landlords bonds bearing per cent interest equivalent to the value of the land taken the state said in effect we can't give you money because we are bankrupt but we will give you bonds which will be an equivalent the tenants then ceased to pay rent to the landlords but instead thereof paid per cent interest upon the amount of the bonds which the state had given to the landlords these annuals payments being made through the ordinary tax gatherers at the end of forty one years these payments ceased both principal and interest having been covered and the tenants had then nothing more to pay that was the solution of the prussian land question and yet the prussian system of land tenure was far superior to ours when i made an argument similar to this in boston one of the papers of that city said it was not a fair comparison to draw because the tenants in prussia were serfs while in ireland they were not i should like to say that if the tenants in ireland are not serfs i don't know what they are applause but in the statement it made this newspaper is wrong again notwithstanding that it is a leading journal of the hub of the universe laughter because the class of persons in prussia that were affected by the emperor edict were not serfs but held their lands under a condition of tenure so far superior to that of the tenantry of ireland that we would gladly until quite recently have welcomed the condition of tenure of the prussian tenantry before that legislation for our present system in prussia the landlord could not raise his rent he could not dispossess a tenant and the latter was permitted to bequeath the land which he occupied to his children while in ireland we had none of these conditions in prussia there were originally no serfs each village or community had its own system of government so that you see the commune is not such a very dreadful word it simply means a system of government by communities and in russia where it was carried out most perfectly it did not mean sharing everybody property with everybody else this system was however broken in upon by the nobles who made serfs of the tenants and the emperor alexander seeing that great evils had arisen from these conditions of serfdom decided that the tenants should own the land the tilled the land had previously been held partly by the nobles and partly by the serfs the latter agreeing to do certain work for the nobles three days of the week they were allowed to till their land the other three days in effect however the serfs were completely at the mercy of the nobles and alexander decided that their state of serfdom must cease the people are no longer bound to labour for the nobles but have been enabled to rent the land at a very low amount fixed by law some two or three shillings per acre while the power to become owners was also given on payment of sixteen times the amount of the yearly rental the government also offered to advance four fifths of the purchase money to all tenants desiring to purchase the land they occupied here are two examples russia and prussia of the state transferring property from the landlords to the tenants the english newspapers are very fond of decrying russia as the home of every kind of despotism it is true however that the land system of that country is at the present time perhaps the most perfect in the world while their system of local government is also most complete and perfect we say then that the damage resulting from the land tenure system of ireland has been indefensible she could produce three times as much food as she now raises under a sensible system of tenure we therefore ask the english government to give us relief the principle which we advocate has already been sanctioned in what are known as the bright clauses of the land act of under which tenants of estates which were offered for sale were enabled to become owners of the property they occupied the government advancing two thirds of the purchase money to tenants desiring to purchase the radical difference however between these clauses and the relief afforded to the prussian tenants is that the act of only contemplated a voluntary sale whilst in prussia the estates of the nobles were forcibly expropriated we think we are entitled to ask the state to come in and do this because it will be a long time before any great amount of relief is afforded if it is lest to merely voluntary sales cheers in ireland for centuries under this iniquitous inequality there had been no peace no prosperity to day an armed force of is needed to protect the so called rights of the landlords to the british government we say the system is false it has been proved false everywhere it is alone productive of famine on every principle of right the system must be abolished we have entered the wedge mr parnell then recited the futile attempts of the constabulary to evict tenants in connemara and said up to this time not one eviction has been accomplished the public sentiment especially in america has said to these minions go no further had these scoundrels fulfilled their tasks fully women and children would have been thrown out in the cold the horrors of war even in afghan lands would have been discounted reprovingly remarked mr parnell to day we are masters of the situation unfortunately we are now attacked by famine we have said to the irish tenants eat the rents and they are doing so you will not allow them to starve you would be unworthy of the land of your birth if you did so these poor people of ireland are struggling against force famine pestilence and cold stand by them in the noble gallant struggle they are making the death of this infamous land system will be one of the first nails in the coffin of english misrule the catholic and orangeman will soon be united to give ireland the proud name she is entitled to among the nations of the earth

      "i feel said mr parnell somewhat nervous in addressing you tonight because of close proximity to boston in which city a leading journal said that i have travelled half round the united states reiterating the same speech and i fear i may say something here that i have said at the meeting in boston the greater part of which i have forgotten and thus give that journal another opportunity to abuse me the present land system of ireland is a feudal system under which the land is owned by a limited number of persons a monopoly by which they attain a social and political importance which otherwise they never would have had this system has been tried in every european country and has been found wanting we would have the english government adopt the same policy as was adopted and carried through by the czar of russia by the government acting as an unbiased judge between the landlord and his tenants both of whom have rights that must be recognized a comparison between the german and irish emigrants seeking this shore in germany almost all tillers of the soil are owners and those leaving home have generally sufficient money upon their arrival to carry them to the west now so with the irish people they are driven from poverty to an unknown shore remaining in large eastern cities being unable to get west for want of money this land system begets a chronic poverty among souls the absence of proper development either of her soil or resources renders existence in good times from hand to mouth but in a period of bad crops famine results and thousands of our people die for food a change of owners is required ireland for the irish against this cry and in behalf of this infamous land tenure the aristocracy of england are making a strong fight the present government of england is not a government of either the crown or the people but of an aristocracy assisted by the middle classes the aristocracy hold the land and control of their tenants thus a change of the system would result in a change of the government the abolition of the system would give the reins of government into the hands of a majority of the people it is for the interest of the aristocracy of england to maintain the aristocracy of ireland for if we break their power in ireland they would eventually lose their powers in england and it is because of this that we are arrayed against the crown the privileged classes and the papers i am glad to see that john bright is coming on in our direction for he says that the land of a country ought to belong to the tillers of the soil and we want his aid in compelling the house of commons to compel the landlord to surrender to the tenant his rights we are going to compel irish landlords to see no matter how disagreeable it may be that the irish tenantry must hold their house lots and if the cruel attempts at evicting are continued on the hillsides of the western coast a much more radical solutation sic of the question may be arrived at than we claim now the present problem for consideration is that in order to settle the land question the people must be kept from starving during the winter in the famine the british government saw an opportunity to drive away millions of the irish people and it was shaping its policy to this murderous and when i left home the agitation in america since my arrival has caused them to alter their richard o'gorman once a of gratitude to the irish people and yet he raises his voice for emigration and looks with plotting eagerness to the great waves of emigration which he anticipates will flock to these shores at the close of the winter but i tell mr o'gorman and the english government that they will be disappeared we will not allow our people to be starved or forced from their homes i received a letter from an irish gentleman in belfast last week offering me or if i would emigrate persons next spring and a fraction per head we are not opposed to natural emigration it is the forced emigration of the landlords that we intend to resist at the present time a most cruel warfare is being waged by the landlords of the west of ireland upon their helpless tenants who in their starving condition refuse to pay what they have not not even to buy bread in this district there have been processes issued which failed to be served the manner itself a tenant neglects to pay his rent he is served with a process as a reminded that within three days he and his wife and children will be turned into the roadside and the house pulled down although processes have been served only five of them have been effective although there were over of her majesty troops present to sustain an execution the speaker closed with a strong plea for energetic work on the part of irishmen and irish americans to save their people from starvation\n",

never sufficiently thank our chairman for the touching and eloquent way in which he has proposed my health i have now for many years been fighting shoulder to shoulder with our chairman and i have always found in him a man whose counsel and advice was most valuable cheers whose courage was unfailing cheers and whose patriotism was unchangeable renewed cheers each and all of us even in those days when our party might have been numbered on the fingers of one hand felt that we had amongst us a rock and a sure anchorage in the fact that justin mccarthy was a member of the budding irish party of that day cheers and i know that i cannot wish for him a fate and a future more dear to his heart than that he may enter with us in a short while within the portals of that house at college green where we hope labouring for ireland to enable her to take her place among the nations of the earth loud cheers mr mccarthy disregarding all temptations has fulfilled to my mind the beau ideal italics of an irish member that ideal that i was so fortunate in capturing the hearts of my constituents at cork with in when i pledged myself to them that i would hold myself aloof from all english party combinations from all english parties until an english party arose which could concede to ireland the just rights of the irish people and enable her to obtain for herself those just rights in an irish assembly in dublin that time has since come about loud cheers when an english party a great english party under the distinguished leadership of mr gladstone loud cheers has conceded to ireland those rights and has enabled us to enter into an honourable alliance honourable and hopeful for our country honourable for that great english party cheers an alliance which i venture to believe will last and will yield permanent fruit and result in a knitting together of great britain and ireland in a true and real union and in a consolidation which will defy time of the great imperial interests which we do not desire to hurt and which englishmen are right in insisting shall be preserved and protected above all others loud cheers we are happy and ireland is happy that this time has come when we can shake hands with englishmen with the consciousness that in doing so we sacrifice we sacrifice no principle or hope for the future of our country hear hear and with the belief that ireland as she has trusted us in the past both in ireland and wherever the irish race exists will be justified by the results of the future in that trust which she has honoured us by extending to us cheers i do not believe mr chairman that if there were a man amongst us who designed treason to our country he would have the power or the opportunity to carry it out cheers there was a time in the parliamentary history of ireland when traitors throve and prospered when under a restricted franchise it was easy for such persons to occupy representative positions and to give themselves and their positions away but that time has gone by loud cheers and there is no irishman to day however great and whatever his sacrifices who can attempt to betray his country with any hope of success cheers because ireland has a full and a perfect franchise and because she knows how to use it for her own advantage cheers i have been accused i think i was accused last year of treachery and venality to my country and it was a curious incident and one very illustrative of want of knowledge of englishmen of the conditions upon which our party is founded and upon which it will exist until its end and aim has been accomplished hear hear it was in reference to some small measure introduced by the conservative government for cleaning out a river in ireland laughter we were not opposing this measure as a party and some of my excellent radical friends came to me and remonstrated with me for this want of opposition and they even went so far as to say we were accepting bribes from the government well i said if we were accepting bribes we were not accepting them for ourselves but that we were accepting them for our constituents and you will find that this government or any other government may go on for a long time offering and giving these bribes for our constituents before they will have the slightest effect in banishing from their minds the principles of irish nationality loud cheers and that it will be found in the end that the capacity for giving these bribes and the power of giving these bribes will be very much smaller than the capacity for receiving them on the part of the excellent persons who have sent us here loud cheers they may bribe the irish people as much as they like they will find that at the end of their expenditure they have got a very poor bargain and as for the irish members they may bribe them to morrow and they will find that there will be a fresh crop springing up which will be equally imperishable cheers i have said this much in order to show you the hopelessness of the task upon which our rulers are engaged in trying to get rid of the present irish representation and in trying to quench the spirit of irish nationality which exists amongst our people cheers they have tried in other ways in times past and they have failed renewed cheers they do not themselves evidently believe in their methods to day cheers because they have not persevered with them and we now see as the result of the spirit of the irish people and as a organized government and a converted british public opinion loud cheers i claim the credit for you and for the men who have sent you here for the parliamentary situation of to day some of us were absent on this critical division undoubtedly i believe i was one of the number laughter but the party were there loud cheers and they were in greater strength than any other party renewed cheers you will remember the situation it was a snatched division hear hear it was said that we knew it was to be taken we did not know it continued cheers if one or two of us had known it it was impossible for us to have gone about the lobbies and tell our or men the evening before that this division was going to take place next day cheers the character of the division would have been destroyed by such a proceeding we could not have sent out a whip it is notorious that the government open our letters hear hear and laughter and defeated its own object so that the division to the irish members was just as much a surprise i think more of a surprise than it was to the members of the tory party who had got a five lined whip cheers and it certainly was more of a surprise to us than it was to the members of the liberal party who had also got a whip renewed cheers but what was the result we had no whip we had no warning we did not know what was going to happen but we were there in larger numbers than any other party continued cheers now what were the figures there was a total vote of members or ½ per cent of the total number of members of the house there were per cent of the tories in that vote there were ½ per cent of the liberals and there were per cent of the irish party cheers i say that that is a very creditable result for the irish parliamentary party hear hear many of whom to come to town for the division had to travel miles by sea and land and so far as the irish party as a body goes it would be most unjust of me if i did not bear my testimony to the fact that they had stood by their posts during the last five years as a body like men cheers and that they have done their duty without complaint a laborious and a fatiguing and a disagreeable duty that they have fought an uphill battle and that as a party and as a body our countrymen are proud of them cheers you who are here know what it is to drag along night after night week after week month after month and year after year in the house of commons to take your turn upon committees in the daytime to sit up sometimes through an all night sitting to be back again the next day perhaps at o'clock for a day sitting hear hear these things are not known or are not notice by the country but the work is done and you have the satisfaction gentlemen of knowing that you have done the work and that it has told cheers and now we have not i am firmly persuaded a long interval before us before we shall reap the harvest that you have sown i am as convinced as i am of my own existence that the conscience of the people of great britain has been reached upon this question cheers that they recognize that ireland is entitled to self government and that she has shown her capacity for governing herself and they believe that we have earned that right and that this great privilege may be conferred upon our people without danger or harm to the greater interests of the empire loud cheers you will find at the general election which is now fast approaching they will intrust to the great statesman who will then be called to power the only man of distinguished genius before the public cheers they will intrust to mr gladstone as his great final and crowning work the task of finding some method in which may be intrusted to ireland to her own destinies while she also is privileged to take a share in the greater interests of the empire i am confident that mr gladstone genius will be equal to the task cheers that he will be powerful enough to reconcile and assuage the prejudices which still unhappily exist to some extent that he will be able to show his countrymen how the true interests of the nation and of imperial safety may be reconciled to the self government of ireland by her people and that a great measure of home rule for our country will be the result a measure which will be practically accepted by the great majority of the english people as a settlement of the irish question a measure which will be accepted by our own people as a sufficient solution and which will enable us to take our part in the government of our own country and none of us wish for any higher or better future cheers which will enable us to develop the long neglected resources of the country to give employment at home to the working classes of ireland to keep our people at home cheers to find outlets for that industry and intelligence which is now lavished on america australia and other far off countries and to enable us to take the first steps for the creation and the consolidation of the irish nation cheers i think that this will be a proud task for all of us after our fighting our weary fighting here at westminster i believe that we shall all gladly exchange the nights and days of combat which have been forced upon us for the powers of peace and of commerce and of progressive industry in our own country cheers that we shall devote our energies to the development of the resources of ireland to the education the neglected education of our country and to those improvements which are admitted on all hands to be necessary for the foundation of the prosperity of every nation cheers we desire to work for ireland we do not desire to harm england cheers we believe that when the bitter wrong in the past has gone by and has been forgotten when we have been allowed to help ourselves and to remove the bitter poverty and depression that now weighs on every irish project and every irish enterprise that our people instead of being a danger to the empire will be one of its strongest sources of defence cheers and when we have perfected those things which call for our immediate and pressing attention in ireland when we have been allowed to devote our energies to our own business and our own affairs at home then some day probably the time may come when there may be chosen from amongst us those men who may be found fit to take part in the greater interest and greater work of the empire cheers but our first thought and our thought for many years to come must be for our own country cheers ireland has been left behind in the race hear hear we want to see her make up this lost ground we want to see her take that place which we know she can take if she gets a chance and until we have done this until our people have had this opportunity our energies must be devoted to our country and we should be unworthy of the name of men we should certainly be unworthy of the name of irishmen if these thoughts did not fill our hearts if these resolves did not animate our breasts and if these determinations did not shape our course and impel us to devote all our energy and all our skill and all our ability to the service of our own country first and foremost cheers i do not think we shall be blamed for this project i do not think that amongst the most critical and cavilling of our opponents there will be anybody who will say to us you aim at disintegrating the empire because you desire to stimulate and improve the resources of your own country hear hear if they do if such a person should arise and should assert that the building of irish harbours or the technical education of the irish people involves a danger to imperial interests i do not think that he will find many people of this country to back him up cheers but if he does we shall be defeated we shall have done our utmost to direct the minds of the people to a constitutional issue hear hear but if the constitution is forbidden to us it will not have been our fault if constitutional methods have failed hear hear we shall have tried and we should then give place to other men hear hear whether you would take part in such things or whether i should take part in such things i know not but this i do know that we have honestly trodden the paths of the constitution cheers that we had no ulterior objects that we have believed that we do believe that ireland can be saved within the constitution cheers and that our spoken words have been honest words that they have not been intended to deceive and we invite the greater power of the greater people of this country to accept our declarations in the spirit in which they have been offered and we believe that these declarations will be so accepted in the near future it is not for me to predict that there is going to be a general election cheers the judgment of anybody in this room is as good as mine upon that point and we all of us must see that the time cannot be long distant when the sands of the present government are nearly run out and that if they continue to drag along a feeble and a wretched existence it will diminish the possibility of a life hereafter cheers and that they have come to that point when every moment of continued life dooms them to the tortures of hell in the next general election cheers we cannot suppose that the present government will not in their declining months be unmindful of the hereafter they may make a death bed repentance they may dissolve suddenly in the hopes that the powers above may not be looking the may amend in their irish policy but whatever side we look i do not see that there is the slightest hope for them whether they attempt to do justice to ireland or what they call justice to ireland or whether they attempt dissolution or whatever they do i see nothing for them except extinction cheers and therefore i think that our prospects are pretty bright renewed cheers they might have tried local government for ireland cheers they might have showed belief in their own nostrums they might have pushed their land bill which was introduced with such a flourish of trumpets a short time ago they might have dredged the bed of the shannon some laughter they might have dredged the bed of the river suck continued laughter or erected removable sluices in the river shannon loud laughter the might have built harbours on the western coast of ireland they might have lent money to irish fishermen to provide themselves with nets and fishing utensils they might have done many things which they have not done they might do these things still and i hope they will do so but the result will be the same whatever they do even if they emigrate the small families which exist in my hon friend mr dillon's constituency in the west of ireland and in the counties adjacent thereto cheers i am sure that i shall be only too glad if they will pour the riches of the british exchequer into these desolate wastes i shall be only too glad if they equip some hundreds of thousands of deserving homesteads in the west of america because all these things will simply remove the difficulties from our way if the congestion of the west of ireland is removed it will be simply so much to our advantage and to our credit cheers i invite them to do these things at all events to try to do them laughter i will not oppose them i will help them we will all help them we will move amendments to their crude projects in committee cheers and laughter we will supply the deficiencies which exist in the intellectual capacity of mr a j balfour laughter we will help them in the multifarious details of their benevolent and philanthropic projects we will wish them god speed in all these things and we will even go so far as to help them to build a good big emigrant ship in which to emigrate the useless members of the present cabinet loud laughter and cheers we think that the capacity of mr w h smith laughter the financial genius of mr goschen laughter the sarcasms and nonchalance of mr a j balfour might be usefully employed upon many a western prairie loud laughter and when an ungrateful british public has dismissed these deserving public servants we shall be most happy to head a subscription for the emigration of these distinguished statesmen to happier and better lands cheers gentlemen for us we want no government positions loud cheers and we do not desire to come upon the british taxpayer we shall accept no office from any government which comes into power cheers if we did accept it as i have before explained to you it would not be any good to us cheers because our constituents would not accept it we desire to devote ourselves to the service of our country and each one of us is pledged and determined in his own heart to accept no office and to undertake no duty which is not bestowed upon him by the irish people cheers we believe our first duty is to our country we will offer ourselves to that duty we will fulfil that duty and we shall be rewarded by the knowledge that to us it has been given to take a part in the solution a satisfactory and permanent solution of the great irish question and that we have helped to reconcile two kindred nations and to banish strife and perplexity from the path of a great empire cheers i shall look to that as our reward and we believe that our countrymen will understand that as members of the british parliament we have here represented the genius of irishmen we have kept alive the traditions of our country we have been faithful to the trust which has been confided to us and we have piloted out country into that haven of refuge which we believe we shall shortly occupy cheers our policy is not a policy of mistrust it is a policy of confidence of hope in our future and the future of our country it is not a self seeking or a selfish policy i have been a witness of the sacrifices which many of you have made to be here at all times and on all occasions when the interests of our country required us nobody can tell but those who have seen these things what those sacrifices have meant what the business men amongst you have suffered and lost owing to the necessities of attending night after night at these divisions what the health of many has suffered what terrible labour this constant drudgery has been to me to all of you i know what it has been you know what it has been our people do not know but our people have confidence in us cheers they have confidence in our policy and as long as they have confidence in our policy and as long as they have confidence they will give us that support which is necessary to carry us on to victory loud cheers mr parnell then proposed in highly eulogistic terms the health of the chairman the toast was drunk with great enthusiasm and mr mccarthy having responded the proceedings shortly afterwards terminated\n",

      "my lord mayor and fellow citizens i am going to begin my speech to night by an explanation it has been made a ground of accusation against me that i have been absent from the field of battle i have had reasons interruption owing to the terribly crowded condition of the rotunda during which mr parnell paused and i do not intend to plead to you here to night excuses or reasons for my action cheers believing that you having confidence in me a voice we have and cheers will not put me to the ordeal of excuses or reasons but that you will take me for what you have known me to be hear hear and for what please god i will prove myself to be cheers in the face of ireland and of my fellow countrymen loud cheers there is undoubtedly a need at the present crisis for discrimination and judgment amongst irishmen well i invite that discrimination and that judgment i have been absent from the fight it is said ah gentlemen when wellington retired into winter quarters within the lines at torres vedras his lieutenants and officers did not seek to fix the halter around his neck cheers well the cause of ireland was lower the enemy was there and the irish army was also there cheers it is easy to make excuses for traitorism sic for secession and for defection but i tell you fellow countrymen that when the day comes of measuring the amount of my shortcomings cries of no no and that of my opponents shortcomings the balance will not be against me shouts of down with the renegades i did not plead the sick list although god knows that it was not a time when i was crippled in health and strength when it was doubtful whether i might ever again come before you god knows that this was not the time to confront me with a movement of mutiny bravo stronger more vindictive more disgraceful and more cowardly cries of healy than any commander in chief has ever been called upon to face cheers ah yes they bided their time they thought i was dead and that they might play around my corpse and divert the irish nation from the true issues involved without reckoning with you and with me cheers they reckoned without taking into account the undying resolve of our race that when they have found a true man they will stand by that man cheers and that man will stand by them renewed cheering the case of the crisis no fellow countrymen this is i suppose a great crisis and who has made that crisis cries of healy and sexton is it me no is it you who is it voices gladstone old gladstone the old hypocrite we shall see some day who it is that has done this deadly thing against our race we shall know where to affix the guilt and the stain which is sought to day to be attached to me cries of never all you join with me to night in declaring that as we are guiltless of the provocation of this dispute so we have confidence that the fight having been entered upon we will acquit ourselves in it like men cheers i would willingly only too willingly as a man whose heart delights in compromise who is prone to compromise who is anxious to meet the objections of his enemies who is anxious to present his smitten cheeks to the smiter sic if by so doing he could prevent other cheeks being smitten i was anxious to assuage this trial to bring peace amongst our race to postpone the terrible issue and to have allowed the irish nation that breathing time to which they are so justly entitled hear hear and why was not that opportunity given to me on the 18th of november the verdict this supposed origin of evil was known why did not mr gladstone tell me then of the confidential communication which he now asserts he is anxious to exercise laughter why did he not tell me then that my leadership had become dangerous to the irish and the english cause why did he wait for nine days before breaking silence why did he allow the leinster hall meeting oh and groans why did he permit you and your good friends to pledge their renewed fealty to me why did he allow every additional bond chain and tie that could be constructed to be set up in defence of my leadership before he spoke hear hear i cannot tell you and he has refrained from telling you but for myself if during those eight days mr gladstone groans had intimated to me by word of mouth or by sign by whisper or innuendo that my retirement temporary or otherwise was necessary cries of no such thing never and cheers i should have hastened to take counsel with my comrades and to rescue them from the impossible position in which they placed themselves by the leinster hall resolution mr gladstone opinion now what fellow citizens is mr gladstone opinion for we have to consider what the danger is what the prospects are before us what is mr gladstone opinion with regard to my retention of the leadership you should know and carefully weigh the opinion of this illustrious statesman groans it is worthy of every respect and consideration at your hands no and i admit to the fullest extent that you cannot suitably approach a final judgment on the issue before you without having weighed his words he says that failing my retirement his continued retention of the english leadership must become almost nominal but does he look to day like a nominal old man does he appear a thing of the past when he is able to bring about the climax in irish history which we see around us to day does he appear effete or likely to abandon the fight nothing of the kind what has been his action you have to separate in this matter the position of mr gladstone from that of the liberal party this is a very important distinction and gentlemen this is a reason if we had no other reason why we should pay every regard and every attention to the opinion and wishes of william ewart gladstone cries of never he is one man and his party is another in he carried this home rule question upon his own shoulders single handed against every opposition oh that was a great feat it was herculean work and we who watched the progress of his work were amazed at the strength and courage which he exhibited we and you were convinced by the object lessons which were then afforded that here was a great man an earnest man who had taken off his coat to the settlement of this great irish question cheers and we said to each other and what was said has contributed to form the public opinion of ireland which exists to this day we believe that this man if he perseveres in the mind which the irish people have brought him to will afford us a solution of irish wrongs and of irish claims cheers and we came before you on that platform we did not surrender our independence loud cheers and it is to this great statesman this unrivalled leader of his own people hear hear but not of ireland loud cheers when he asks you to surrender your independence and to depose your leader we are here to day to say gladstone we respect you and your position we acknowledge your immortality your strength and power exhibited on so many diverse and great battlefields but we decline to fuse with you cheers we decline to surrender to you cheers that independence of our party which has produced the fruition of our hopes and the crowning of our expectations cheers now i said a while ago that there was a distinction between this grand old man for he is a grand old man cheers and no and his colleagues hear hear there is all the distinction in the world between a man and his colleagues sometimes laughter and cheers but the distinction in mr gladstone case is a little out of order it is a distinction between the tail wagging the head and the head wagging the tail laughter and cheers and the message that ireland send back to the grand old man is this resume your place as leader of your party cheers back up your legitimate authority and when you put yourself in the position of an independent leader such as ours is then and not till then will we allow our leader to treat with you upon those equal terms which alone can assure a lasting possible and permanent settlement cheers mr gladstone followers i pass to the other section of our opponents i have drawn a distinction a very necessary distinction between the grand old man and some of what i was going to call the tail but whom i shall call followers of the national liberal club cheers and when we see that english money is lavishly promised we do not know yet anything about the performance is lavishly promised by the seceders to start an anti irish paper against the freeman journal simply because the freeman has been true to its convictions and to its leaders cheers we are in a position to estimate the magnitude of the forces of our opponents when we have fathomed the depth of the purses of henry labouchere and professor stuart hisses mr parnell defence there is one thing fellow citizens that we all agree upon unanimously i believe and that is that if my resignation to to morrow cries of never and no if by it i could bring the fruition of your hopes the one thousandth part of a second nearer that resignation would be cheerfully given cheers and a voice it will never come another voice we will stick to you to a man there is no opposition to that proposition hear hear so we come to the consideration of the proposition i made in that direction was it an honest and straightforward proposal yes did i mean to keep my word yes the old man showed that i meant to keep my word by refusing to pledge his cheers but what is the depth and length and height and breadth of this outcry that unless ireland is false to herself and to me she will lose her progress of the last years a voice healy and hisses why you might as well have told washington at lexington or at bunker's hill cheers that unless he surrendered his trenches to the british army he would lose the fruits of all the exertions of himself and his compatriots that had gone before cheers the statement is absurd upon the face of it hear hear who are putting it forward a voice renegades my god if it was an honest movement i would yield to it on the spot but what is it what is it oh yes it is a movement of hypocrisy from top to bottom hear hear and cheers it is a movement which while professing anxiety for the success of home rule is undertaken and forwarded by men whose home rule is skin deep hear hear but whose hatred of ireland is not skin deep it is a movement which depends in some of its main features upon what we will call for the sake of euphony a temporary aberration of judgment it is a movement which depends for its strength upon invincible ignorance and it must die the death of invincible ignorance it is a movement which depends upon testimony of which only one side has been heard cheers and do not think there is no other side hear hear and cheers oh but i will not dwell upon this portion of my defence cries of there is no necessity i need not hear hear my defence will be known some day loud and prolonged cheering and waving of hats i could not come amongst you and look you in the face as i look you in the face to night cheers did i not know that there is another side to this question as to every other question loud cheers and that you will wait cries of yes and hear the other side cheers before you decide that i unworthy as i am cries of no no am too unworthy cries of no and parnell for ever am too unworthy to walk with you even within sight of this promised land which please god i will enter with you great cheering the irish charter but fellow countrymen there is another side which i can speak of to night without loss of integrity or of honour and i will speak it is the side connected with the public consideration of this question which you must know in order that you may faithfully fulfil the position of judges which fate has determined as your lot i have claimed to night as i claimed at cork in the face of my constituents in alone there and almost unknown there in one speech i obtained their sympathy and lasting support hear and cries and will again i have claimed that the integrity and independence of the irish party must be beyond all things and above all things and what is the meaning of these words integrity and independence at a time when we have to consider offers of places to irish public men oh made by grand old spiders in good faith and singleness of purpose which is so characteristic of spider and fly and we have to consider what is the meaning of the pledges that we have made hear hear the pledges fellow countrymen that we have made are not pledges that can be idly broken hear hear you talk about the situation to day you say and rightly say that this is a crisis for the irish nation all the world over but i tell you that the crisis of to day and the climax of to day if you will they have been but a feather weight in the balance compared to the intensity the intolerable character of the situation which would have been brought about for ireland aye and for england too cheers if i or any of your representatives had been permitted for a single moment whether of mastery or of weakness on our part or by negligence or by carelessness on the part of our constituents to forget the spirit or the letter of the pledge of cork of cheers but what was the pledge remember it always it proclaims in no uncertain voice that no irish representative was to accept place or office situation or emolument under any english government or be amalgamated or merge their views in any english political party which did not first concede the just claims of the irish people cheers that is your charter hold fast to it loud cheers that is the ground upon which i stand to night cheers and upon which you must stand with me renewed cheers and cries of we will if you are to find any safety in constitutional action i have not misled you cries of never i have never said that this constitutional movement must succeed i have never promised you absolute success but i have promised you this that if you trust me cries of yes we do and if you support me i will do all that mortal man can do to deserve success cheers the present position of the irish cause now what is the position we stand fellow citizens at the parting of the ways you cannot if you would avoid the issue that is forced upon you it is an issue which means the life or death of the constitutional movement hear hear i have not promised you success i do not promise you success but i have said and i repeat to night with all the force and energy that my poor words and voice can give the declaration that if ireland cannot win upon this line she can win upon no other line within the constitution and if our constitutional movement of to day is broken down sundered separated discredited and forgotten england will be face to face with that imperishable force which to night gives me vitality and power loud cheers without which we are brokenkneed bending blown aside by every blast of wind and if ireland leaves this path upon which i have led her upon which she has trodden until she is almost in sight of victory i will not for my part say what will accompany her future cheers but i shall claim for myself the same right which each one of you has to consider the future to be warned by the mistakes of the past and to shape my course as the side lights and the guide lights and the head lights may best direct for the future success and prosperity of ireland cheers you may ask what this means whether i intend to cross the rubicon and to burn my boats i cross no rubicon cheers i have no boats to burn hear hear but my position is the position of and i say to you and to all irishmen beware beware while you have time and while the power is still in your hand before you surrender for ever to forces which you cannot the control illimitable power of our race hear hear which has shown itself in these streets of dublin to night without which i should be worthless and useless with which i am strong cheers and with which on my side i pledge myself to push forward until we have reached the goal or until the majority of the irish people tell me that the goal is not this and that i must try some other method cheers now there are some questions still to be dealt with very important questions undoubtedly most important i have made two of these questions tests of mr gladstone genuineness and bona fide italics character as a politician and a statesman i am that up to the present he has not answered to the touchstone with reference to the question of the land you who followed the course of recent events know well that the question of the land is a vital question for ireland hear hear no statesman whatever his calibre can attempt to solve this question the national questions without solving at the same time or giving us leave to solve at the same time the land question cheers but that test has been disregarded we are left without any answer to our query as to whether the liberal party if they come into power will allow us to settle this land question or settle it themselves that is a matter that has been put to them straightly sic and plainly and it is capable of a straight and fair answer cheers and i ask to night before i define my position further what is the answer of mr gladstone to the question that was put to him last week as to the settlement of the land upon the settlement of the land depend many things on it depends practically your independence because upon it depends the stability of the home cheers how can a man be independent how can he feel like a man if at any moment a constable can walk in with his baton and say to him you and your wife and family are at my mercy and must go the thing is preposterous on the face of it cheers not for a single moment could the irish race could irishmen agree to accept as final any solution of the question which did not give to us the ordinary rights of citizens in england involved in the control of the policeman baton cheers then again i am asked about the question of the evicted tenants the question of the evicted tenants is undoubtedly a most important one hear hear i do not want to blow my own trumpet certainly not but it is right when the position of these poor people is assigned as a reason for my destruction that i should tell you what has been and what may be the position of the evicted tenants is this that they have to look to the same solution that you have to look to and the maintenance of the independence and integrity of the irish party is their only safeguard cheers i have done my best for them and i will continue to do my best for them in i rescued the balance of the funds then in existence for the purpose of securing the future of these evicted tenants my colleagues know well those of them at all events who were then in public life that minority of them which was then in public life that in those days i did everything that i could and that i have from that day to this protected and defended the evicted tenants who were left to us as a heritage from the land league days hear hear that not one of those me has ever wanted a meal or an hour of self respect or comfort hear hear and that i have made them my first thought and consideration cheers the same thing applies to the evicted tenants whose eviction has since come about hear hear i have not been the cause of their eviction but for the sake of union i do not dwell upon this but they are there they have acted honourably as honest irishmen they have sacrificed the future of themselves and their little ones for the cause of our country and the irishman would be shameless he would be worthy of condemnation he would be worthy of being thrown to those wolves those english wolves of whom we have heard if for a single moment any means was left untried any necessary power not put forth for the purpose of securing and consolidating the future of these patriots cheers the labour question in ireland i have to say another word about a question of great importance and moment to us all a question which i could not evade if i desired to it is the question of the relations of ireland with the labour population i have told you i could not evade this question and i should not wish to evade it if i could hear the men who made ireland what she is to day and who will hew her course amongst the nations of the world in the future are the labouring population of ireland for them i must have care on them i must depend cheers so to them i look for the recruits in the grand army of irish nationality which i hope to lead in the near future cheers without such men our strength would be nothing hear hear therefore i look to them cheers and i say to them that they are entitled to look to me cheers if i am the leader voices so you are and cheers should i not answer this question i think i ought to i do not think i should seek refuge from a position undoubtedly difficult behind any cowardly quibble or subterfuge what you may ask do you propose in the interest of the labouring classes let me tell you some of the things that i have done i do not refer to it for the purpose of influencing your judgment but for the purpose of showing you we have not forgotten those men in order to prove to you that we do not intend to forget them cheers in i drafted the irish labourers bill a very small measure of redress for these poor people it was passed into law it was amended by a subsequent act and so far as it goes i understand that it has given satisfaction and promoted to some extent the comfort of the working class hear hear but this is a very little thing i do not say that this bill this labourers bill should be considered by you as at all the measure of what we can do for you pending home rule of course you will have noticed that the question is divided into two branches you have the consideration of what could be done for the irish labourers with irishmen legislating at college green and you have the consideration of what could be done for them for the irish labourers and artisans with irishmen legislating at westminster hear hear i have never held out great hopes at westminster and i shall decline to do so to the end but i do say this in answer to the plain question what are you prepared to do at westminster for the irish artisan and labourers i am prepared to say this that we can assist the english radical party to strengthen the back of the grand old man we can break down the unwillingness which exists on his part to face this question in common with many other questions we can insist that equal justice and equal measures shall be meted out to ireland as well as england hear hear and above all things we can help the irish working man to consolidate this movement to organize it in such a fashion as may be conducive to the best interests of the national cause cheers we can show them how far they may go with regard to the due interests of the national question hear hear we can help them to attain that limit we can insist that they shall attain it we can above all things and before all things provide for irishmen that resource and aid of organization which is so important for them hear hear and this is what i purpose to do taking this question at first sight as a question before home rule before you can have the power of settling it for yourselves and of regulating it as you wish best i say that i will do my utmost to reconcile all prejudices upon this question so that this great labour movement upon which we depend and which must be all powerful by right governing and direction upon the future of ireland may be directed may be guided into a course in consonance with the legislative independence of ireland cheers and that acting in this fashion i shall be able to see that nothing is omitted however small for the purpose of obtaining for labour and the dignity of the labourer a rightful and proper and overwhelming position in the councils of the nation cheers appeal for support now i finish as i commenced i say to you fellow countrymen that a self respecting irish nation is necessary for the success of our cause cheers that we cannot be self respecting if we accept the dictation or the orders of any outside leader cheers i ask you confidently to judge me by my record great cheering if you have any fault to find with me cries of no no none now is your time to bring it forward loud cries of no no and cheers i do not pretend that i have not my moments of trial and of temptation hear hear but i do claim that never in thought in word or in deed have i been false to the interests great cheering that irishmen have confided in me hear hear and if i after years of combat can come before you to night and can proclaim my invincible determination to persevere in this path is it too much to ask of you that you strengthen me with your good will cheers and with your appreciation cheers and i pledge to you despite the lies of the enemy that that determination has never been broken cheers i pledge to you that your judgment shall be vindicated and that the cause of ireland will win that triumph which a self respecting nation and a self judging nation can alone confer upon us the cause will win that victory which your ardour and your determination to night shows me that you are determined to win loud cheering mr parnell also spoke at an overflow meeting held in the concert room at which mr richard power m p presided mr parnell said that they in dublin that night and ireland to morrow would see that there was life in the old dog yet great cheers and that though snarling jackals might prowl round the camp fires and might take advantage of times of warfare to attempt to plunder their general that general would find himself when he came back to ireland cheers he found that the young men who had grown up with the movement he founded years ago had not forgotten him cheers he had not forgotten them cheers he had always looked to the youth of ireland as his assistants in the great task of building up their nation and to whom else should he look but to the young men he said to them go forward towards the fruition of their hopes and his hopes as constituting if need be the only cause of their existence with such devotion as he had seen that night and with such rank and file as he saw around him to follow him to death he feared nothing for their cause cheers when passing by grattan monument and looking upon that memorable and imperishable name he said i have followed the hearse of the enemies of ireland i have watched by the cradle of the birth of irish independence and i know that having come thus far with me you a warm hearted race will not forbid me to lead you to this promised land and that you will not declare me unworthy of sharing with our nation the future joy happiness prosperity and freedom of our race cheers mr parnell addressed also two open air meetings after the meeting in the rotunda was over mr parnell came out on the platform in front of the building and delivered a brief address he was received with great enthusiasm\n",

      "mr parnell stayed last night with coroner horgan who is also mr vincent scully legal land and conducting agent and arrived in town to day at noon he was recognized as he drove through the streets and a crowd quickly collected and cheered him as he entered the victoria hotel two deputations waited upon mr parnell with the object of holding a private conference viz the committee of the cork national league and the leaders of the irish democratic labour federation mr neillan one of the federation deputation said he was authorized to hand over the care of the movement to mr parnell mr davitt he wished to add claimed to be the father of the movement mr parnell mr davitt claims to be the father of everything mr neillan said the organization was started before mr davitt was aware of the intention to form it mr parnell said he would accept the responsibility of taking the federation under his care he had his hand on the helm now and he would guide the ship safely through subsequently it was intimated to a large number of press representatives who were assembled in an adjoining room that mr parnell wished to make a speech in public mr parnell speaking with great earnestness and determination then said in leaving cork for kilkenny i desire to say for the information of my constituents and for the guidance of the irish people that i will not in any sense or to the slightest extent dissociate myself from any responsibility which cork conferred upon me in and which she again confirmed last night hear hear that responsibility is a heavy one and especially at this moment it is of the greatest possible importance that i should speak clearly for the guidance of our people in the very difficult circumstances in which they find themselves i have had for some months past to consider questions relating to the interests of different bodies of irishmen i have had to consider the position of the national league i have to consider the condition of the labourers movement in this country and to judge how far i as your leader can and ought to reconcile the interests of that movement in this country and to judge how far i as your leader can and ought to reconcile the interests of the irish national movement i do not see therein any insuperable task hear it is undoubtedly a position of some difficulty but my thoughts and my instincts have always been directed to the working men of ireland as the future safety and the future hope of our nation cheers it has always been my desire to have on my side the hard handed sons of toil hear hear and to show them that as i look to them and to their help to assist me in building up the future of the irish race so on their side they are entitled from me to every consideration as a most important wing of the future national army cheers i shall endeavour to do what in me lies with the heavy sense of the responsibility upon my shoulders without attempting or seeking to use this question or that question from the point of view of self interest or from any other point of view save that of the interest of ireland hear i shall endeavour to act as i have done in the past to weld together in one solid mass and whole all the forces of our race and to keep these forces bound together in solid conjunction so that no man can say that ireland is disunited or that anything has been left undone by me to retain the confidence of my countrymen and with that confidence to march on with them to victory cheers the responsibility of determining what is to be done in the interests of these men must rest with me i accept this responsibility as your leader i accept this responsibility as in and in years since i do not shrink from it and i ask you to strengthen my hands as you did yesterday and have done to day so that there will be no shirking on your part or mine in the great task i now feel to be before me cheers men of kilkenny i am sorry to say that i have not much voice left to address you but the little i have i must use to say to you how touched i am with this magnificent demonstration here to night i have come to your city to ask you to help me in securing the independence of the irish party at westminster and that you should agree with me as i have no doubt you will that you and ireland will allow nobody no matter how illustrious to come between you and the voice of your leader cheers having spent years in the service of my country i think i ought to know how best she can be led to victory cheers there is an old saying never change horses when you are crossing over a river cheers and i who have led these people up to within sight of the promised land will now be abandoned by you and deemed unworthy to accompany you to the end cheers this is the principle that we have got to fight it is home rule for ireland free from outside interference of any body and if you cannot be trusted to choose your own leader pray what can you be trusted to do a voice nothing now fellow countrymen i shall have other opportunities of addressing you perhaps when my voice is better than it is to night but allow me to say that you have given me courage to persevere on this path to the end to go on with you until we have won this victory coming here to kilkenny i have obtained some of your strength and i thank you men of kilkenny for your reception to night believe me i shall never

      "a voice down with castlecomer down with the colliers mr parnell oh no no we don't want to down any man amongst our countrymen i respect the motives of everybody even the motives of the men who threw lime into my eye at castlecomer and i know the day will come and come very soon when those men will be the first to acknowledge how misguided was their action cheers and to range themselves as you are ranged to day upon my side and upon the side of ireland cheers before i leave this question which i should not have referred to at all if it were not for the remark which came from the crowd and i have only to say that we have rural accounts contradicting our accounts and experience of what happened at castlecomer the doctors who operated upon my eye stated that it was lime not quicklime but slacklime if it happened to be quicklime no medical skill nothing could have saved the sight of my eye for a single moment dr tanner and canon cody who were close by and apparently knew all about it are not united on the same story one of them says the tanner laughter that it was flour and the clergymen says it was mud well i leave them to reconcile the trifling defect in their testimony cheers and laugher and i will only say that it would have been better for my former colleagues to have known less than he appears to have known about the outrageous attack upon the man who was his former leader loud cheers and to whom he owes the opportunity of being able to vilify me to day from any public platform in ireland renewed cheering but i will go on to the public aspect of this question if it were possible that kilkenny should return pope hennessy cries of never i would say that the hand of the dial of the progress of our nation had been put back to the evil days of when ireland by the treason of another band of pope hennessys was left as a corpse upon the dissecting table in those days the independent men of our party allowed themselves to be driven from the field by a combination between the keoghs and the sadliers of the day and when athlone in obedience to the dover of elphin returned the solicitor general keogh she sealed the doom of ireland until in god directed me to put my hand to the plough loud cheers fellow countrymen i will allow now combination however strong however influential however apparently respectable to drive me from my duty to ireland prolonged cheering while i have life i will go from one constituency to another from one county to another from one city to another from one town and village and parish to another to put what i know is the truth before the people renewed cheering i know that i must win cheers i have no fear cheers so let nobody think that i am made of mud renewed cheering let nobody think that the men who are supporting me my faithful colleagues thirty five in number amongst the irish parliamentary party oh and the gallant men forming as i believe the majority of the irish people as i know and feel sure the majority of the irish people the vast majority of the irish people in ireland in england and in america let nobody think that these men have faint hearts that they shall cease from this struggle until ireland has had the opportunity of declaring her voice from the centre to the sea hear hear and loud cheers to the voice of ireland alone will i bow cheers i will not yield to english dictation loud cheers which i will not regard have never regarded and i am not going to begin now i will not regard the cowardly hypocritical voice of english newspapers cheers where would you be and where should i be if i had reckoned it as being worth even that miserable little skeleton hanging now at the end of the fishing rod in the crowd cheers they are to me as being lower than the mud in the streets for the mud in the streets cannot help being there but those men are reasoning men and they are not blind but they have malice in their hearts against ireland and seeking her destruction as their aim they seek to destroy me first cheers now fellow countrymen i tell you that i shall go on in this this is a national question and it is also a question which affects every peasant in his cottage what is the programme of this party what is the programme of this party i don't know what they call themselves i believe they have not got a name yet laughter i have been trying to discover some christener for them some godfather and no one has come forward yet i believe the new leader has already come down to kilkenny after waiting for a week he telegraphed to the hotel opposite to have a good stiff tumbler of punch on his arrival and to have a bath of hot water and mustard i believe that if you walked over to him beyond you would find him sitting in that bath of hot water and mustard laughter a voice he is a grand old man mr parnell i would say that he is an old mao sic but i would not say that he is a grand old man yet laughter he is a nice old gentleman for a quiet tea party laughter after a time i suppose they will be setting up a few more new leaders in his place anyhow they have got plenty of would be leaders among them as i know only too well but fellow countrymen the issue is not whether justin mccarthy is capable of being leader because he has not got an ounce of steel in his whole body or for the matter of that in his soul either cheers but whether we are to take our politics from england or from ireland whether we are to maintain together the ranks of the irish parliamentary party or not whether we are to hold to this organisation of the men who have brought you within sight of victory who have compelled even the grand old man to recognise their strength cheers after fighting us for twelve years or whether we are to give in to all the old women and humbugs in england who are taking this opportunity of airing their virtue over the country they need not talk to ireland about virtue irishmen and irishwomen know how to guard their own virtue without any advice or dictation from england and when the time comes my countrymen will know that they have not trusted me in vain and that i have been a faithful and a brave leader of the destinies of my country during these sixteen years so you will find some day that i am not the disreputable man that my cowardly opponents would like to persuade you fellow countrymen where and what is the programme of this nameless party upon the irish land question what is their platform with regard to the control of the irish police what are their plans for the benefit of the irish labourers they are dumb these gentlemen not one word have they said of what they intend to do for the farmers artisans and labourers of ireland their whole talk has been their ventilation of their refuse about this miserable scandal they have nothing else to stand upon but filth but i believe that the pure waters of public opinion will wash them and their filth away before it what is our programme i am able to show you what we have done for you in the past not much not near as much as i would have liked to have done i tell you this that there is nothing more heart breaking nothing more disappointing than dependence upon the imperial parliament or upon english statesmen for benefits to ireland it is like drawing blood or trying to draw blood from a stone to extract any particle of help of succour of assistance or of comfort for suffering ireland from the imperial parliament and what we have dragged out of them during these years has not been drawn from them by their sympathy but by your force by your determination and because they could not help it cheers and if it has been so little if the labourers act has been so little if the land act has been so little it has not been our fault but the fault of that english public opinion to whom your false guides tell you to appeal to day to listen to to day and to rely upon to day in opposition to the men who have stood firm and fast to the principles of irish nationality cheers and i say to you men of kilkenny we will continue to gain benefits for you in the imperial parliament like the small benefits we have gained for you in the past but we ask you to look to your own power your own future power to make laws at home as the natural safeguards as the only guarantee for the future strength and consolidation of the irish nation we ask you to strengthen our hands in demanding that when we have wrung from england this greatest concession of all the right of ireland to make her own laws at home it shall not be an illusory one it shall not be a big board of guardians which can be turned out by the batons of the police even before its members have taken their seats but that it shall be a real legislative body depending on the suffrages of the people of ireland not under the power or control of any englishman or english public opinion but an institution which when you have obtained it will be powerful to build up your nation to take her rightful place amongst the nations of the earth loud cheers and above all things will be powerful to keep for you what you have to day renewed cheers and there is a great deal in this prolonged cheering you are asked to put your leader on one side a voice we will never do it so help me god to throw him into the common pits of the camp to rot there by these englishmen and if they interfere in this matter which they admit belongs to you and to you alone what is to prevent them when we have got our parliament unless we get with it the means of holding it keeping it securing it and strengthening it what is to prevent them from saying to you we do not approve of this thing that thing and the other thing that you propose to do there is nothing in the world to prevent them from taking up such an attitude and depend upon one thing that if you yield to them they will take it up if you yield to their dictation to day they will try it on again a little later cheers now then is the time for irishmen to take their stand and to say that they know how to manage their own affairs at home that they will decide this question amongst themselves and that they will bring that judgment which they brought to bear when they put me in the position i now occupy and will exercise that judgment and that they will decide that question not by the clamour of english opinion but by their own common sense and judgment by their own knowledge of me as a man by their knowledge of my history during the years that i have been in their service and by my fruits and my actions and my services i asked to be judged cheers have i been a faithful servant have i been an unjust steward no have i in any way been slack when i ought to fight no no and cheers i never have my countrymen and i will never cheers i feel within me that the day of our victory is near that this is the last bitter and doubtful struggle before ireland a voice it is not doubtful mr parnell that the gates of darkness are open before us and we are even now walking in the valley of the shadow of death yet the light will surely come the light of the irish sunburst which has never been obscured and which never will but will always be a beacon to our nation will encourage us forward will lighten our path will show us the true toad we will walk together to victory loud cheers\n",

      "fellow citizens i desire to attempt to express to you how deeply your spontaneous and magnificent reception to night touches my heart a voice it is not half enough cheers mr parnell believe me fellow citizens that the welcomes that i have received in the chief cities of leinster and munster in dublin in cork and in limerick impress me if impression were necessary but it is not with the grave responsibility which has rested upon me and which must continue to rest upon me cheers and a voice on no one else until ireland obtains the right to make her own laws on her own soil a responsibility which was never heavier than at the present moment hear hear some people say i am prompted by insane ambition no no and others say that i have cast on one side an honourable position and that i now intend to throw in my lot with the enemies of my country no no these assertions are made by irishmen scarcely at all a voice tim healy prolonged hissing mr parnell they are made with a few exceptions by the english press and by hypocritical english public opinion hear hear they are made by men by englishmen who mistake the relative position of england and ireland in the alliance which we have entered into with them we entered into an honourable alliance an alliance if you will of a weaker nation with a stronger nation but still of a nation with a nation cheers and for you i claim for the irish people i claim that the decision on all matters relating to your own affairs and to your own interests and business shall be decided by you and by you alone cheers now let me consider this question for a moment the question of english dictation and i tell you candidly and truly if it was only a question of english dictation and there was nothing else concerned i should have yielded in a moment but it is more than english dictation hear hear let me consider for a moment this subordinate question this english dictation these englishmen have mistaken as i said the relative position of the two nations i have been accused of seeking to stir up strife and of resurrecting the hatchet which has been buried no no i have not sought to resurrect that hatchet i have not sought to stir up strife but i will show these men what our position is before this battle is finished loud cheers i say that i have not sought to stir up strife which i have done so much to allay which i have taken so much responsibility upon myself to allay i have not sought to stir up strife and i will not seek to stir it up cheers i know what strife is and god knows we don't want to enter into any battle unnecessarily but if they drive us into a battle we will fight it out loud cheers yet i hope they may not who commenced this strife voices healy hisses oh no it was not any irishman voices gladstone hisses the bishops said that it is all a question of morality cries of no no sic i say it is not a question of morality a voice you are as good now as ever you were another voice what about willie abraham laughter and cheers mr parnell if it had been a question of morality these estimable men would have interfered at once hear hear but they were too late hear hear they waited for a whole fortnight before they expressed their opinion cheers they waited until gladstone hisses and groans until stead hisses and groans and every miserable old woman in england desirous of airing his virtue had interfered and expressed his opinion before they expressed theirs and with all reverence for any bishop and with all reverence for any priest and with all reverence for any church i declare as a man and as an irishman it is not open to the irish bishops to claim they had interfered on the question of morality because they were too late cheers no it was a question of politics and i know the irish people are better judges of politics and have better convictions and truer sentiments in their heart core and know what they should do in danger and emergency better than any body of men however learned and however illustrious cheers let us consider for one moment i don't want to tire you cries of go on the present situation william o'brien cheers mr parnell waving his cap called for cheers for william o'brien which were given has traversed the ocean to consult with me as to the course to be taken i look upon william o'brien and i say it without any disrespect to my colleagues either those who have held with me or gone against me and always looked upon him as one man amongst eighty six cheers as one man amongst a thousand cheers as one man amongst a million cheers and i look upon him as a trusted and true friend of ireland ever since i first met him in when we commenced the campaign of the land league i have always turned to him in moments of doubt and difficulty for honest and patriotic advice and what william o'brien was in i know he is to day cheers and i wish to god with a fervent wish that william o'brien instead of listening to misleading cables despatched by men who whatever their good will or good intentions were not entitled to be reckoned or to stand as leaders of the irish race had come amongst us a month sooner and given me the support of his counsel and presence which he has now offered to me at the eleventh hour cheers fellow countrymen wm o'brien i honour and respect his judgment and i know and recognise his courage and i am convinced of his patriotism and i have always known that he has had a deep friendship for myself deep lasting long continuing and fervent and i would be unworthy of my position if when he had come to europe i did not hasten to his side to learn his views to consult with him and to be guided even by his judgment so far as his judgment and mine went together in the direction of the interests of ireland cheers let me tell you this i am not permitted to say to night to what length we travelled on this road together but i may tell you without any breach of confidence as a thing entirely between myself and yourselves that i was perfectly satisfied with the length we had travelled together cheers that is all i can tell you and you will have to possess your souls in patience until you learn more on this point i am not permitted to disclose the result of the boulogne conference and negotiations because to do so would imperil the best interests of the country and now all i can say is that i look forward with hope with every hope to the result of this conference cheers but whatever the result may be i shall continue in the path that you chose for me in cheers i shall deny myself where self denial is necessary i shall endeavour to be brave where courage is necessary i shall attempt to imitate even at so long interval the devoted patriotism and supreme courage which the irish people have shown from time immemorial in defence of the nationality of ireland cheers if i falter if i am weak if i do not realise the ideal of you patriotic irishmen i ask you to believe of me that i shall fail not by intention not from my heart that i have desired to accompany ireland to the gate of freedom and within the gate of freedom and if it should not be permitted to me to enter with you within that

      "mr parnell replying to the address said mr mayor mr donnelly mr finucane and friends i thank you exceedingly for the kind and affectionate words which you have present me in your addresses and more especially do i thank you for the opportunity you have given me of speaking here in this room to many of my old friends and colleagues who helped me in and hear hear to found the great movement which seemed a short time ago was on the point of immediate success kind friends and colleagues also who in the years that have gone by have constantly stood by the cause of ireland and have kept on the path straight towards the goal of nationality hear hear recognising in you as i do the leaders of public opinion in this town hear hear and in many of the surrounding districts of tipperary and clare i am rejoiced that i have an opportunity of speaking to you on many subjects some of which i fear will have to be dealt with in great detail which i should not like to have to inflict upon your patience but which it is exceedingly necessary that not only you but the people of ireland should perfectly understand and ponder upon in order that they may approach the consideration of the very grave questions which in all probability shall have to be left over for solution to the next general election with an unbiassed and well informed mind hear hear you will recollect that the origin of the controversy in its present shape was the issue of a mandatory letter by mr gladstone hisses calling upon the irish members practically speaking to depose me from my position as their chairman and it is claimed by many of our opponents that the controversy thus started was further complicated by my manifesto which was shortly afterwards issued as a reply to that direction of mr gladstone and i desire on the present occasion to direct your minds to the consideration of the grave and weighty questions which i felt bound to raise in that manifesto they may be shortly described as the four points connected with the management of the constabulary the appointment of the judicial bench in ireland including resident and removable magistrates the solution of the land question and the proposed reduction of the irish members in the imperial parliament from their present number of to and before i come to deal with these subjects in great detail it is necessary for me to call your attention back to the position in which these questions were left by the proposed home rule bill of a position which was distinctly murdered by the suggestions and opinions expressed by mr gladstone during the hawarden communications in the bill provided with regard to the control of the constabulary that the royal irish constabulary shall while that force exists continue and be subject as heretofore to the control of the lord lieutenant as representative of her majesty even under that bill we were not to have the control of the constabulary and there was no period fixed for enabling that force to pass under the control of the irish executive depending upon and drawing its power from the irish parliament of the legislature it is true that it was further provided that the irish legislature may provide for the establishment and maintenance of a police force in counties and boroughs in ireland under the control of local authorities and arrangements may be made between the treasury and the irish government for the establishment and maintenance of police reserves but while the power was given to the irish legislature to establish a police force of its own at its own expense it was also provided that the payment for the constabulary up to the amount of a million and a half pounds sterling a year should be defrayed absolutely by the irish legislature out of irish resources in other words that while the constabulary were to be retained under the control of the lord lieutenant and the imperial power for an indefinite period in fact there was nothing whatever in bill suggesting that they were ever to cease to exist the irish legislature was bound to pay so much to the expenses as could be covered by a million and a half points sterling per annum in proof of this i could of course refer you to the clauses of the bill but i think it will be more simple if i read for you a passage in mr gladstone speech introducing that measure i may say said mr gladstone a few words on the important question of the constabulary and then he goes on to say the charge for this body is now a million and a half but we propose that the consolidated fund of great britain shall for a time relieve the irish legislative body of all expenditure in excess of a million and a half but as the expenditure never has exceeded a million and a half the amount of the sum which mr gladstone proposed that the consolidated fund of great britain should relieve the irish legislative body from paying amounted to nothing at all laughter mr henry o'shea the wily old fox renewed laughter mr parnell it is one of his peculiar ways of putting unpalatable facts before the public hear hear i will not pause here to point out the inconvenience which would have existed in the establishment of a civil police force an unnecessary force under the present circumstances because with or armed constabulary throughout the country i think it would be held that this number certainly would be sufficient for the maintenance of what is called law and order in ireland a voice and the garrison and this civilian force would have been also useless in the presence of a large and powerful body of armed men who at any time could have them all up in the police barracks as obstructions of the public peace hear hear but i pass from that subject in order to point out that by the hawarden communications the position as it was left with regard to the royal irish constabulary under the bill of was distinctly made worse now it has been charged against us that we accepted the bill of with these objectionable provisions regarding the constabulary it is quite true that we did accept that bill but we accepted it with the strongest protests against the insufficient arrangement regarding this constabulary force with the strongest protest against the indefiniteness of this arrangement and in the hopes conveyed to us by mr gladstone speech that before that bill was through the committee some sensible change would have been made in this respect and that we at any rate should have a term of years within which the control of the imperial authority over the constabulary should cease substituted for an indefinite period proposed by the bill mr gladstone in introducing the bill said with regard to this body i think that there remains much for consideration in order to devise the details of a good and prudent system but we think it our first duty to give a distinct assurance to the present members of that distinguished and admirable force that their position will not be put to prejudice by this acct either in respect to their terms of service or with regard to the authority under which they are employed that sentence gave us hope of the amendment of this clause regarding the constabulary in the committee and in view of that sentence we did not like to break up the then liberal government and destroy all chances of obtaining the second reading of a bill which although insufficient in this respect yet contained many most valuable provisions and the second reading of which we should have chiefly regarded under the circumstances of those times as a declaration by the house of commons in favour of ireland right to the restitution of her legislature but if we were satisfied with such a declaration of principle then it by no means follows that we should be satisfied with it to day when we are confronted with the demand by english and by leaders of english public opinion that ireland should subordinate her rights maintain her own parliamentary party into the hands of such men as henry labouchere professor stuart and mr stead of the pall mall gazette hisses and a voice and tim healy and when there is too much reason to know that the independence and integrity of a section of the irish party have been sapped by the influences which i faintly described to you when addressing you in as has been recalled to my recollection and to yours in the address which has been presented to me by the reception committee but gentlemen as i have said the position in respect of the constabulary bad as it was in was distinctly worsted by the hawarden communications we may have been wrong to have accepted the bill of perhaps we were a voice it hardly satisfied the people we may have been too pliable too easily influenced by the magic and the glamour which surrounds the great name of mr gladstone and the wonderful oratory which he has at his command but at least we had in those days and independent and united irish party and an independent and united ireland cheers and we hoped and believed that that independence would be preserved and maintained none of these attempts which have horrified all that is sound in irish public opinion to influence and pervert the spirit and determination of your members had then been made and for my part i have always felt that it was my duty to risk much in order to lay the foundation of a settlement of this question between the two countries hear hear probably i took too much responsibility upon myself no probably i had too great confidence in my own strength no but i know this much that i gave the assurances which i then gave with a belief that the irish people would accept that measure as a final solution honestly and in good faith with a determination in my mind to leave nothing undone on my part to reconcile conflicting views and interests amongst our people at home and abroad to make the best we could out of this settlement to work with it and to endeavour by its means to build up the prosperity and the happiness and the freedom of our country in future cheers undoubtedly i have been almost appalled by the load of this responsibility and especially since the hawarden communications when it became evident to me that we were not even to get the provisions of the bill of i am glad that that responsibility is now off my shoulders i am glad that i am no longer responsible for the future success of such a measure as that of whittled down by the conclusions expressed to me by mr gladstone at hawarden i feel the lighter in spirit and the sure confidence in the future hear hear than i possibly could feel while staggering along under the load of such a burthen hear hear but at the same time it is my duty gentlemen to leave nothing undone having regard to the position that i assumed upon this question in committee room no to bring about the union and solidarity of our party and of our nation hear hear and i shall continue to be impressed with the responsibility that still continues to lie upon me in this matter a voice and will applause mr parnell i am sorry to have to bring you back to details again but details are very necessary in this question because they are the details connected with the life and future of our nation and of our country hear hear they are details which shall determine whether our people are still when home rule has been obtained and when a parliament with maimed powers sits in college green they are details which will determine whether the tenant farmer is still to live and struggle on under an oppressive rack rent whether the labourer is still to starve in the attempt to obtain a sustenance where sustenance is forbidden him in return for his labour or whether the irish artisan is to be allowed with some prospect of success and of hope in the future to devote his power of hand and of mind to the furtherance of his craft let me bring your mind back again for a moment to these details i have dealt with this condition in which the control of the irish constabulary is left under the bill of i think that very few irishmen exactly knew what were the conditions of that measure as regards that force now let me on to deal with the other matters the judicial body the question of the appointment of the judges and of the resident magistrates under the measure of it was proposed to give the irish executive depending upon the irish parliament the power to appoint all judges including the lord chancellor all magistrates and so forth that power was absolute well that would have been a great thing it would soon have put an end to the removable pranks of which we have had so much to complain during years past but by the hawarden negotiations a period of ten or twelve years was interposed during which the appointment of this judicial body was not to be left under the control of the home rule authority then let me go on to the land question side by side with the bill of the home rule bill of there was a great and comprehensive measure of dealing with the irish agrarian question by purchase i thought at the time and think still great and comprehensive measure because its greatness cause it to break down owing to its own weight hear hear but at all evens it was a solution of the question and the two bills were vital to each other and interdependent that policy has now been departed from and in substitution of it we have no policy at all hear hear don't take me as agreeing to all the details of this bill of it is true that the price to be given for the land was far and away too great and at the time we distinctly guarded ourselves against accepting more than the principal of land purchase contained in that measure but it was a solution and picture to yourselves gentlemen the position of the first irish prime minister of the future my esteemed friend mr justin mccarthy i suppose laughter and no and parnell only taking his place in the irish house of commons without even the power given to that body to appoint a policeman to guard their door or to keep clear its approaches without the power to control a single policeman throughout the whole of ireland with an unsettled land question with people being evicted in their hundreds and their thousands every day of the year as the case might be with the present judicial rents not reduced with another period of agricultural depression and fall in prices in full swing which is bound to come again sooner or later and all this in a parliament which would have practically little direct power of legislation save that perhaps of founding a catholic university hear hear why the position of the strongest man in existence would be intolerable under such circumstances hear hear and he and his ministers and the parliament which elected him would be a body which would not even have the position in public opinion and esteem the boards of guardians have at present and it would have very little more power but these things with all their imperfections might have been tolerable and it might have been possible to survive them and work our future out if our party had remained independent of english influence hear hear but that is not the position now and furthermore a proposal was also made at hawarden that the irish members should be reduced in number by two thirds now mr gladstone has given a general contradiction to the accuracy of my statements in regard to these matters he has stated that he has in his possession a memorandum from which he spoke at this interview and i know that he has for i saw it myself i consider that that memorandum ought to have been published hear hear and it would have then been seen in what respects my statements in the manifesto were a departure from the truth hear hear but i have been able to confirm the accuracy of some of my statements in that manifesto by a document written by myself by a letter written on the 18th of march of last year only three months after the interview when the matters were fresh in my mind and when even my most bitter enemy cannot claim that i had any reason for misrepresentation or suppression of the truth much less deliberate invention it is a letter to mr cecil rhodes the present prime minister and i think the then prime minister of cape colony that gentleman was much interested in the question of the retention of the irish members at westminster you have all seen the correspondence published when he gave us a munificent gift and i wrote to him a letter dealing with this question of the retention of the irish members and also with the question to some slight extent of the constabulary and of the judicial body and you will see when i read you this letter by and bye that it contains a remarkable confirmation of my statements respecting these three points the constabulary the judicial body and the reduction of irish members in my manifesto but first let me read to you for a moment the denials very general and vague denials given by mr gladstone to the accuracy of the statements contained in the manifesto the first of these was that it would be necessary to reduce the irish representation from to that was one of the four statements in the manifesto and with regard to the control of the irish constabulary it was stated by mr gladstone that having regard to the necessity for conciliating english public opinion he and his colleagues found it would be necessary to leave this force and the appointment of its officers under the control of the imperial authority for an indefinite period while the funds for its maintenance payment and equipment had been compulsorily provided out of irish resources the period of or years was suggested as the limit of time during which the appointment of judges resident magistrates etc should be retained in the hands of the imperial authority at the conclusion of the interview i was informed that mr gladstone and all his colleagues were entirely agreed that pending the general election silence should be absolutely preserved with regard to any points of difference on the question of the retention of the irish members he says not to one of my suggestions did mr parnell offer serious objection i deny then that i man the statements which his memory has ascribed to me or anything substantially resembling them either on the retention of the irish members or on the settlement of the land or agrarian difficulty or on the control of the constabulary or on the appointment of the judiciary as to the land in particular i am not conscious of having added anything to the public declarations while as to county court judges and resident magistrates i made no suggestion whatever the conversation between us was strictly confidential and in my judgment and as i understand in that of mr parnell to publish even a true account of it is to break the seal of confidence which alone renders political co operation possible i will just read portion sic of the letter which relates to these matters in my letter to mr rhodes march private dear mr rhodes then there is some introductory matter which does not bear upon the present question i have been thinking of writing you for some past as i thought you might like to hear some of the views entertained by the liberal leaders upon certain points as i learned them at hawarden mr gladstone and his colleagues have been considering very fully the direct question of the retention of irish members and there appeared to be three alterations this was the question in which mr rhodes was interested the retention of all irish members for all purposes the retention of all irish members for imperial purposes the retention of a reduced number for all purposes mr gladstone told me that the conclusion at which he and his colleagues had unanimously arrived was overwhelmingly in favour of the last alteration viz the reduction of the number of irish members to but that it had been agreed that no public reference should be made to their views on this point and that the matters should remain perfectly private and confidential i represented to him that i could not yet express my concurrence in the proposed reduction in view of the unsatisfactory state in which the question connected with the constabulary and the judicial body had been left and then i go on to say with a reduced irish representation it might easily happen that a conservative government might come in and with the constabulary and judicial authority under their control might treat us as badly as they are doing now from this point of view a reduced representation would be dangerous and then i go on to discuss certain alternative methods in which this difficulty might be got over but as the question is no longer a question of reduced representation but a question of something being made clear in the bill itself that the question of the constabulary and of the judicial body and the land question shall be placed upon a satisfactory basis it is not necessary for me to go into that portion and then i conclude yours very truly charles stewart parnell loud cheers now here is what mr gladstone says not to one of my suggestions did mr parnell offer serious objection if i did not offer objection to mr gladstone why did i offer objection to mr cecil rhodes i wrote to mr rhodes that i could not yet express my concurrence in the proposed resolution in view of the unsatisfactory state in which the question connected with the constabulary and the judiciary had been left i did not write this letter to mr rhodes in view of this controversy no no it was written nine months before the controversy i object to three points in this letter to mr rhodes i object to the reduction of the irish members and i object to the unsettled state in which the question connected with the constabulary and the judicial body had been left it is preposterous for mr gladstone under these circumstances to withhold any longer from publication this memorandum which he says he has hear hear and which deals with this question mr gladstone goes on to say i deny that i made the statements which his memory ascribes to me or anything substantially resembling them either on the retention of the irish members or on the settlement of the land or agrarian difficulty or on the control of the constabulary or in the appointment of the judiciary what statement did he make to me on the point it is not what he has not made or is not going to but what we want to know is what he did say he was going to do hear hear that is practically the question before us he says as to the land in particular i am not conscious of having added anything to my public declarations while as to county court judges and resident magistrates i made no suggestion whatever it is difficult to make anything out of mr gladstone public declarations it is said of him that he possesses the marvellous and for politicians very happy faculty of being able to place a different interpretation upon any statement he makes other than that placed upon it by his opponents so far as my recollection serves me i can interpret from the declaration he has since made upon the land question nothing which practically at all differs from a statement in my manifesto he has no policy no vital policy upon this land question and the conduct of the liberal party and leaders show this because thy allow their tail to wag their head upon this question the opposition to land purchase and peasant proprietary was gotten up by the tail of the liberal party i do not believe there is any substantial need for that the present government have brought forward a land purchase bill and they have passed it through its first and second reading and into committee almost without opposition from the liberal party and without any protest from the liberal party and without any protest from the liberal party in the country and i consider that a fatal mistake has been made by the liberal leaders in showing this weakness to the demands made upon them by the radical section that the principle of peasant proprietary should be in ireland abandoned and practically speaking we should be left to our fate as regards the solution of the land question the land question in my judgment must be solved concurrently with the establishment of an irish parliament or it must be left ot the irish parliament to solve hear hear i don't care which alternative is adopted but one must be adopted otherwise it will be impossible for any settled government to be in existence in this country whether english or irish whether dependent on the english parliament or the irish parliament without the use of stringent and strong coercion hear hear these are questions that will have to be considered that ought to be considered before the general election and that should be considered by you and by the english people too and which will have to be answered before the general election by the liberal leaders hear hear let me now deal with the last matter the charge of breach of confidence in reference to none of these communications so far as my memory serves me was there any expression or condition of confidence or secrecy except the last one regarding the retention of the irish members of course i regarded them as confidential but i felt myself at perfect liberty to mention them and i considered it prudent to do so to the persons of responsibility of judgment and of discretion and i did mention some of them to the prime minister of the cape colony my letter to whom i have already read for you and to mr wm o'brien loud cheers and cries of bravo i did not mention all the communications to mr o'brien we were dealing with the land question and his memory is absolutely identical with mine as regards the number of members or renewed cheers how can mr gladstone undertake to say that he denies he made the statement in reference to the retention of the irish members does he rely upon the difference between and when he makes that sweeping denial laughter or does he rely upon the fact that i did not think it necessary to state in my manifesto the alternative proposals which had been dismissed by mr gladstone and all his colleagues as unsatisfactory and not to be further entertained i don't know what he further relies upon when this memorandum is published laughter but to continue my examination of his accusation of breach of confidence which has particularly struck the episcopal body they make it a charge next in gravity to the other one in reference to which they ostensibly interfered i have dealt partially with this question of breach of confidence before but there is another important fact in connection with it which i now publish for the first time before i issued that manifesto twenty four hours or more before i issued it i saw mr justin mccarthy the vice chairman of our party and told him what i intended to do i gave him an outline of the statements i intended to make in the manifesto and i have reason to believe that he placed my intention before mr gladstone himself hisses a voice the old trimmer laughter mr parnell mr mccarthy communicated to me mr gladstone observations upon my communication and upon the outlines of the statements that i intended to make but there was no reference whatever from mr gladstone against my publication of this manifesto on the ground of a breach of confidence loud cheers now i have dealt with these disputed points between mr gladstone and myself and i will now pass on to a wider question and that is my view as to how the land settlement might be arrived at and probably it will be found a more moderate view than many others but in all these matters i have always desired to make a settlement between the two countries while preserving the guarantees for its workable character as easy as possible for english statesmen and the english leader who has to obtain the assent of the imperial parliament to it i thought the action of the liberal party upon the land bill of the present government a foolish one last session it certainly was not a patriotic one in my judgment hear hear under the working of the measure insufficient as it is wasteful of the public funds as in many respects it undoubtedly is impudent and audacious in its character where it lays hands upon irish local resources and hypothecates them without our consent as it undoubtedly is there is in it much of good and if we had preserved our ranks unbroken and if the liberal leaders had condescended to be strong enough to follow the advice which i gave them last session as to the handling of the government proposal i believe it might have been possible to have converted that bill into one of great utility and to have eliminated those objectionable features i urged upon mr morley that instead of moving a direct amendment to the second reading of the bill we should have moved simply an amendment claiming local control and the establishment of local bodies to control the bargains which it was proposed should be made between landlord and tenant after my advice was rejected in this particular when the motion for going into committee was going on i urged upon mr gladstone that the plan of compulsory purchase should be adopted which i believed and still believe may eventually prove a solution of this question may enormously diminish the magnitude of the area and may economise to a very considerable extent the funds now considered necessary for the solution of the agrarian difficulty hear hear my proposal was simply this that instead of leaving it to the landlord to decide what land he should sell the land commission should decide and that there should be given to the land commission compulsory to buy up at a fixed number of years purchase according to the poor law valuation of the holding any holdings they pleased throughout the country by the adoption of that system of compulsory expropriation you would in my judgment settle the land question but for a much smaller sum than the sum of one hundred and fifty millions which mr gladstone proposal in entailed or for the sum of one hundred millions which mr balfour proposal of to day entails you would also incidentally obtain a solution for all the evicted tenants throughout ireland hear hear and save them from the doubts and the fears which many of them must exist under at the present unhappy juncture but that proposal was also rejected at least mr gladstone promised to consider it and i have heard nothing more from him upon the subject from that day to this we are now left with this a certainty that the liberal party has no land policy that in order to conciliate one section of their supporters the radical section they have given up the idea of peasant proprietary and land purchase and in order to conciliate another section the whigs and the lords in their late cabinet they refused to entertain a proposal of reducing the rents by an amendment of the land act of or by conferring upon the future irish parliament the power to deal with this question well i consider that under the circumstances it is perfectly useless to talk about home rule at all because home rule instead of being a reality and a source of strength prosperity peace and freedom to our country would be a sham and would only land us into worse hot water than we are in at present and it would inevitably end in a very short period in our losing even the limited privileges which have been conferred upon us cheers and a voice english rule well now gentlemen i have told you what my views are as to land settlement and i now pass to the unhappy dispute and division which at present exists in our ranks i do not wish to inquire into the motives which dictated the action of the majority of the irish members against me in their surrender to mr gladstone but i am perfectly willing to admit and i desire to take this opportunity of expressing my belief that probably the majority of them were actuated by good motives as to a minority i have from time to time expressed my opinion upon their conduct perhaps too strongly no under circumstances of great provocation i do not wish to repeat any such expression of opinion to day but as regards the majority of these men i say that they had no commission from their constituents to decide this question and that whatever their motive whether it were honourable or the reverse whether it were good or bad they were not and are not in a position by their knowledge by their information by their character by the circumstances under which they were chosen to sit in judgment upon me to express or pretend to express the opinion of the country upon this question cheers it is a mater ever to be regretted that their blind haste their eagerness to obey their new leaders impelled them to press forward and from day to day in that committee room without cause without cessation as if minutes were golden hear hear how many of them must wish that they had paused instead of sending misleading cables across the atlantic cheers that they had waited the return of men like wm o'brien loud cheers a voice they are only mud another voice they are no men at all mr parnell whose advice and judgment would have been esteemed and respected by me as it would have been compulsory upon them cheers perhaps we may be able to say as a result of this that it is better late than never hear hear i cannot forecast the future or speak with certainty as to the result of the present negotiations but i think perhaps that without incurring the imputation of a breach of confidence mr o'brien would not object to my saying if he were here and could be consulted that in the negotiations which we had up to the present or rather in the result of the negotiations which we have had up to the present we have been able to find ourselves so far in agreement cheers a voice that is good news mr parnell and that we fully recognised at the conclusion of those negotiations that the future steps until we can resume them would have to be taken by other men certainly not under my control but upon whom a very great responsibility will rest if mr o'brien and i are not again able to resume those negotiations with an assured hope of success cheers for myself gentlemen i will only ask you to believe that i have not been actuated by the contemptible petty motives attributed to me a voice you're a patriot cheers mr parnell i desired nothing more then and i have always been willing if i were sure that a solution of the question which the irish people expect to get would be offered in the time to come by the english liberals a solution without which it is useless for us to suppose that we have any hope in going on with disunited ranks and in subjection to an english party hear hear that if that solution is going to be the solution that is to be offered to us and fought for us by the liberal party i am willing to stand to day by the declarations i made in committee room no i shall be confident of the future i shall then know that this question will be settled upon a sure foundation that the task for which i entered public life shall at all events be completed so far as it is possible for me in my position to obtain guarantees and i shall cheerfully retire from the chairmanship of the party cries of no we won't have it which i should scarcely care about leading in its present composition which i should scarcely be asked to lead again composed as it is at present applause i should then know that i should carry with me in this action the judgment and the good opinion of my fellow countrymen and confident of the future i should wait for the future to vindicate me to the fullest extent by the unanimous voice of our people as to day all that is best and soundest amongst you have done applause and i should seek for no other or further or better vindication loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell said mr crowe and gentlemen of limerick political prisoners amnesty association i thank you for giving me this opportunity of expressing my views on the case of mr john daly i have always felt very strongly from my knowledge of mr daly position in irish politics and not only in irish politics but in irish movements not connected with the constitution that mr daly was absolutely innocent of the offence of which he was was sic convicted and received the cruel sentence of penal servitude applause that is the belief which has always been strong in my heart i felt it was utterly impossible that mr daly from his particular position could have been connected with a dynamite movement or could have any sympathy with it whatever hear hear indeed if i might hazard an opinion on the subject it would be to say that mr daly would be a strong opponent of the dynamite movement hear hear that is my belief from my knowledge of mr daly character views and positions in all the movements which have been attempted both constitutionally and otherwise for the freedom and advantage of ireland applause i certainly felt deeply when he was convicted i feel that his treatment in prison even if guilty which i am absolutely confident he was not has been most disgraceful and absolutely illegal in its character applause i have always been willing to do anything i can to help him i should have moved myself in the matter only i knew the question was in the hands of gentlemen who were devoting their energies to it in parliament and endeavouring to obtain his release it is a rule amongst us that when a question is taken up by a group of members it should be left to them and another member is not entitled to take it out of their hands but if this question had even come forward by a debate on a motion i should have spoken in the sense i now address you mr richard gleeson they thought to buy john daly as they bought pigott but they failed applause mr parnell i know the history of that i think the attempts made to induce mr daly and other men to perjure themselves were most disgraceful and reflect everlasting infamy on everybody who carried them out who aided defended or sanctioned them hear hear put before me in collected form all the evidence and information you have so that i may be able to use it in parliament when we obtain the day for the discussion of the case of mr john daly i shall ballot for that day and other members shall ballot for it and you may be always assured of my practical sympathy applause\n",

      "gentlemen of the central branch of the irish national league i have had so many and so abundant opportunities of publicly expressing my views upon the important political position existing at this moment that i am glad to be able to tell you and i am sure you will join in my delight that my remarks to day can be very brief indeed but before coming to the political portion of what i have to say i know that i shall interpret your views best as i certainly shall express my own wishes and sentiments if i refer to the departure from amongst us of one who has for many years been a most esteemed member of our branch an earnest worker in the cause and in the irish national ranks and who also for many years was one of my respected and loyal colleagues hear hear i mean alderman john o'connor hear hear who has been removed from amongst us by the hand of death i was horrified when opening the newspaper this morning to find that so dear a friend was gone from my side i wish that he might have been spared to see the cause of ireland triumphant a cause that he helped so ably and so well but it must not be so it only remains for us to express as well as we can the deep feelings of respect and veneration with which we regard his memory hear hear and to vow that we shall take example and profit by that example of patriotism and of fortitude which he always so prominently afforded to his fellow workers in the national cause hear hear i think it would be proper for me when turning to other subjects to deal with the conspiracy of lying hear hear which next to billingsgate seems to be one of the most prominent characteristics of our opponents resources and arguments i made as many of you will perhaps have seen certain statements at limerick in one of these statements i disclosed the fact that twenty four hours before the publications of my manifesto in london i had given mr justin mccarthy an outline of its leading features or proposed leading features because at that time the manifesto itself was not in existence and that i had reason to believe that mr mccarthy had conveyed my statements to mr gladstone because mr gladstone had so informed him and had also advised me as to the line that mr gladstone was going to take in reference to these statements when they appeared in the manifesto this has been attempted this declaration of mine at limerick has been attempted to be contradicted by three very important personages mr stead of the pall mall gazette italics laughter and groans mr justin mccarthy hisses and mr gladstone but like many other people when they find that the truth has been told and they do not wish to be discovered in point blank denial of the truth they invent for me a statement which i never made and the pall mall gazette italics inquires of mr gladstone whether it was true as suggested by mr parnell at limerick that mr mccarthy had communicated to him the contents of mr parnell manifesto before it was published now as you will observe i did not state either that i had communicated to mr mccarthy or that mr mccarthy had communicated to mr gladstone the contents of my manifesto for a very good reason my manifesto was not in existence twenty four hours before its publication but i did say and i repeat the statement to day and i am in a position by the mouths of independent witnesses by contemporary events and statements to prove the truth of this statement hear hear i did communicate to mr mccarthy an outline of the principal features of the matter which i intended to embody in the manifesto i communicated to mr mccarthy an outline of what are known as the four points the questions regarding the constabulary regarding the judicial bench or body the land question and the retention of the irish members and mr mccarthy went to mr gladstone with this information because he told me on two occasions subsequently once when we were alone together and another time in mr john redmond presence that he had been in communication with mr gladstone and that mr gladstone intended to deny my statements point blank cheers and the occasion upon which he made this statement in the presence of mr john redmond was on the night of the issue of the manifesto before its issue before it had been sent to the press and after i had read it to mr mccarthy hear hear he turned round to me and said well all i can say is this that as i have already told you mr gladstone intends to deny every one of these statements point blank now i think before the end of this controversy is arrived at if it does go on the irish public and the english public will be able to judge as to which side most of the truth rests with applause i was pleased to hear from mr harrington that the subscriptions which have come in since our last fortnightly meeting amounted to several hundred pounds it shows to me that the country is still practically solid with us and with this organisation loud applause that they are not going to desert the organisation which has stood by them for twelve years applause and cries of never in favour of a mongrel committee laughter suddenly started up of mushroom growth and mainly composed of expectant lawyers laughter applause and cries of tim i think these subscriptions will go on and that they will increase applause it is of the utmost importance in view of the locking up of the reserve funds in paris by the action of mr justin mccarthy who has served a threatening notice upon messrs monroe the bankers who have custody of those funds it is of the utmost importance that every exertion should be made by the people of ireland for the purpose of sustaining the evicted tenants these evicted tenants are entitled to everything that we can do for them hear hear they represent the wounded soldiers of the war against landlordism hear hear they are men who undoubtedly have shown the highest and the most perfect form of heroism and of patriotism in the action which they have taken and it would be disgraceful to this country if their hearts were for one moment allowed to grow faint or their confidence in the determination of the irish people to stand by them to the end of this struggle diminished for a single instant i don't wish to speak of my past action in regard to this question of the evicted tenants but i have always felt from the very first that it was of the most vital importance for the future of the national cause for the satisfactory settlement of the land question that in no case should any evicted tenants or any body of tenants be compelled by the withholding of the most ample support to make unjust terms with their landlords hear hear i have always been in favour of fair settlements hear hear but i have always devoted every energy and every forethought which it was possible for me to bestow on the subject to the provision for enabling the evicted tenants to settle on a footing and basis of equality with their landlords when time for settlement came hear hear we have carried on our backs many evicted tenants from the period of the passing of the land act and of the arrears act who were left out of those two settlements we have carried them from that day to this and not a single estate which had valid claims on the old land league has been allowed to want its monthly or fortnightly grants for a single day from that day to this hear hear we obtained in the arrears act which saved undoubtedly many thousands of evicted tenants from destruction in when the plan of campaign was started and when large numbers of tenants owing to the depression of the times the depression in prices the depression in agriculture and other causes came upon the public funds for support and for help i did everything that i could to see that no single evicted tenant should suffer hear hear i have repeated my pledges from time to time publicly in the house of commons and elsewhere that no matter what my opinion may have been as to the policy of that movement called the plan of campaign yet it was undoubtedly my duty to see so far as it was possible for one man to see that no single one of these tenants should suffer if it was possible for us to prevent that suffering it is quite possible for the irish people to prevent these sufferings the liabilities are not overwhelming they are serious they are large but they are not of such a character as to render it anything but a work of small difficulty for the people of this country to provide for them and to show them that they recognise the sufferings which these men have made for the tenant farmers at large and which have gained great profits in the way of reduction of rent and so forth for the great body of the irish tenant farmers throughout the country i would then say this addressing myself to these victims throughout ireland do not despair and do not feel faint hearted but have confidence that although the time may look dark for you at present your fellow countrymen will stand by you and will see that in no respect shall you be allowed to suffer applause i have spoken at length upon this subject because it is one which has always been nearest to my heart i do not wish to make it a controversial question hear hear i hope it may never be made a controversial question but certainly i have much to complain of as regards the way in which this question has been handled if i chose to speak on the subject i could speak and refute many of the arguments which have been so unfairly directed against me in reference to liability for the condition of these men and their future prospects but i prefer not to enter into any such conspiracy i prefer to do everything that i possible can to rescue these men and their families hear hear i see no reason whatever why i cannot be successful cheers the new members proposed to day show also that our organisation is still the organisation of ireland applause and that whether you go to dublin or cork or to limerick wherever an educated public opinion exists cries of bravo wherever the people have an opportunity of reading the speeches and of studying the action of the irish leaders and of reading those great instructors of public opinion the daily newspapers that in every such case where education and knowledge and patriotism are possessed by the irish people they are everywhere unanimously on our side and determined to support us loud applause our opponents have to go to the dark corners and holes of ireland hear hear in order to obtain an audience of voters so ignorant as to vote and support their nominees hear hear we have every confidence not only that we shall win but that we shall win in a much shorter space of time and with much less confusion trouble and distraction in this country than is now so commonly supposed hear hear so fellow countrymen i am not downhearted in the slightest degree applause i desire to act consistently with the position which i have taken up in this matter from the first i shall not allow any attacks however disgraceful however cowardly to ruffle my temper applause i shall not stir from my purpose hear hear which has been over and over again declared to you and to the world and i am confident in my own conscience that that purpose is a just one but that it is a prudent one and that under no other condition could i conscientiously or fairly act having made these declarations i shall stand by them applause and i shall ask you gentlemen to believe that whatever happens that in any action that i may take i have acted in the fullest faith confidence and assurance that the interest of ireland has been safeguarded and secured loud and prolonged applause gentlemen in thanking you for your enormous and representative attendance which i value very highly indeed at this juncture i will only say that i think that mr harrington suggestion is a wise one and that we should now terminate our proceedings and dissolve our meeting without any further

      "gentlemen of the town commissioners of tralee of the young ireland society of the committee from killarney of the gaels and of the tralee registration club i return my best and warmest thanks for your addresses for your presence here and for the kind and affectionate sentiments which these addresses convey to me my meeting with you recalls to my recollection a time on the 9th november when i stood in this town and explained to the people of tralee my views on the solution of the land question hear hear and the bearing which i considered the solution would have upon the settlement of the national question and i am glad to be able to say that i have held in view the principles which i then laid down and which you then accepted from that day to this applause and these are my principles still as they are yours the progress of events has justified in an unusual and most remarkable manner your prescience and the justness of the views which you then accepted from me hear hear at the time irish hopes for the future were slight and small indeed and when i came amongst you perhaps only the most ardent irishmen could travel with me into the future with the same confidence which i then had and which i still have in my heart applause i then told you what i thought ought to be the attitude of your irish members in the house of commons and explained to you some of the dangers besetting the path of those members as a warning that i did not come before you as a mere parliamentarian and as one who being elected to the house of commons merely intended to make for himself a comfortable seat there for the rest of his life no no and that i went there looking forward to but a short sojourn in the assembly that i should use my position there as a means for obtaining for ireland the restitution of her legislative independence applause and that i should never forget for a single moment that that was the object for which i was there and that if i forgot it a voice the hillside men won't hear hear mr parnell you would quickly remind me of it and withdraw from me that only which makes my arm strong and my words powerful your confidence applause now i don't wish to trouble you by too long extracts from the speeches which i delivered on that day of november thirteen years gone by but there is one bearing upon this question one short extract which i believe you should hear again i said unfortunately the air of london is very contaminating a man may be the best in the world in tralee and make fine eloquent speeches but when he moves over to london and meets his fine acquaintances at the national club for instance hear hear somehow the edges of his patriotism gets blunted and if he spend sic three or four years it is found that he has no edge left at all a voice ned harrington has his edge hear hear mr parnell i don't mean to say that that has been the universal fate of all of us but there have undoubtedly in recent years been some men who fell away but it is your duty to take action before they have gone too far cheers but i wish chiefly to remind you all of what i then said in reference to the land question i shall not merely trouble you with the quotations but i then described for you as the solution of the land question the cutting down of the rents by arbitration or judicial valuation and after that had been done the establishment of an occupying ownership was the only proper solution of the land question and within three years mr gladstone introduced his land act for the purpose of carrying out the first part of the programme which was then laid before you the cutting down of the judicial rents and if he had only made a good job of it we should not be standing here to day with the irish land question still unsettled cheers i well recollect his words in introducing that land act he said he had been accused of bringing forward a measure containing the three f's well he said there may be three f in this bill but they are three small f's not big ones and the fact is gentlemen that if he had made them big ones it would have been better for him and for us cheers and the same remark applies to his proposed home rule bill if he had had the courage to make it a big home rule bill instead of a little one i should look forward with confidence to my retirement knowing that the cause of ireland no longer wanted my leadership well gentlemen as to the three f measure you know that i took the responsibility of preventing the extreme section amongst the land league from throwing out that bill and i am glad that i did take that responsibility because i believe the progress of events since then has justified the action that i took cheers we have one by one removed some of its defects we have obtained recognition for the irish labourers under the act of we obtained the arrears act for the small farmers of ireland in which lifted a large weight of arrears off them cheers we forced the tory government in to include the leaseholders and cut down judicial rents we produced an amendment of the bright clause of the purchase clauses of the act of which has led to a large extension of occupying ownership under the arrears act i have been taunted with coming from kilmainham jail on false pretences and for my own private and personal objects no no i have been taunted by a man who while i was in jail was in treaty with one of the ministers joseph chamberlain hisses to sell me behind my back hisses and groans for healy and the origin of whose spite and malevolence was because i then checked his intriguing as i have continued to from that day to this when they have often been repeated and when he taunts me with the mistrustful statement that i concluded a treaty with joseph chamberlain i know well and he cannot deny it that he wished to conclude a treaty at that time while i was still in jail with joseph chamberlain behind my back and the backs of his party and sell the cause of ireland for nothing cheers after i came out from kilmainham jail i was not afraid to undertake that responsibility for coming and i took care i got for you something worthy the sic acceptance of the small tenant farmers and the irish evicted tenants in the shape of the arrears act hear hear and i was glad to suffer obloquy upon that and be misunderstood and misrepresented because i knew that day as i know to day that i was right and would have the approval of the irish people hear hear in here in tralee in my speech i foreshadowed as a solution of the land question a method which has been closely followed by the legislature by slow faltering steps if you will but still closely followed from that day to this i also took occasion then to contest the opinion of many of my advanced friends that if we solved the land question we would damage and perhaps destroy our hopes of the solution of the national question i said and argued the question as i am prepared to do now that i did not believe in any such contingency arising and knew that the placing of the tenant farmers in a position of independence and security so far from weakening the national sentiment would strengthen it hear hear i always felt strongly that view and though many amongst my friends took a different view the course of events has justified the opinion i then expressed that was prior to the land legislation of and subsequent measures in the same direction have not weakened the national sentiment but made it stronger the tenant farmer is not a worse nationalist for being independent of his landlord and not being obliged to take off his hat to him cheers but i am sorry to say that some of the leaders of the liberal party and this is one serious cause of difference of opinion between me and them which has existed privately for many months some of the leaders of the liberal party and some irish members appear still to apprehend that danger which i combated in and which i combat to day they don't want to have the land question settled by a system of land purchase i do say settle it make the tenant farmers owners of their holdings upon equitable terms and in my judgment you will have removed one of the two great impediments to home rule cheers but there is another great impediment i could not get the liberal leaders to adopt a straightforward and consistent attitude in reference to the government land purchase bill of last session they insisted upon opposing it on the second reading they insisted upon opposing it on going into committee i wished to improve it not to oppose it and if my advice had been taken we could have materially improved it before our ranks were broken and our strength injured and destroyed by this terrible split in our party and which to a great extent had been reduplicated throughout ireland i hope still to be able to do much in that direction but now at the eleventh hour the liberal leaders after having rejected my policy and after having insisted upon opposing it on its second reading stage and upon the motion for going into committee through the mouth of mr morley have at least come to recognise that there is much good in this bill of the present government and that it is their duty to make the most of it cheers i only wish that they had done this six or seven months ago and we should have been able to make it a very much better bill and stretch it a great deal further than i fear will now be possible under the circumstances now let me talk to you about the question of the labourers let me give you some of my reminiscences upon this subject we are told we must have regard to english public opinion to the opinion of english statesmen i am perfectly willing to regard english interest or imperial interest and concern but where the question is a question which only concerns ireland then i say i will not regard english public opinion loud cheers where would the labourers act have been or where would any act have been if we had regarded english public opinion nowhere and cheers why mr gladstone up to protested most strongly against any revision of the judicial rents any cutting down of judicial rents judicial rents were in his mind sacred never to be touched again in we compelled the tory government to cut them down let me illustrate my meaning by a little incident which took place on the first occasion to say that my view was that way to settle the labourers question was to give him a house and a piece of ground under some elected authority in ireland independent of his employers cheers mr john bright who was a great leader of english opinion a great radical a great tribune of the people was listening to me in the house of commons and he got up and made a most violent attack upon me for this suggestion he said it meant that the irish land commissioners would refuse to work at all and that a great deal of the poverty of ireland and the bad condition of the irish labourers was due to the fact of the great number of catholic holidays which were kept laughter but notwithstanding mr bright and english public opinion upon this question two years later we carried and obtained the assent of the imperial parliament and the queen to the principle which i then laid down cheers the same way it has been with every other question the arrears act the leaseholders act we have always been right and they have always been wrong cheers in two recent events the question as to the concurrent solution of the home rule and the land questions has come to the front and it has again been forced by my speech at limerick upon the attention of the liberal leaders i have shown them by that speech that we required the liberal party to make up its mind upon this question before we can go any further with them cheers we know that at present the late cabinet is divided we know that mr morley whose action upon all irish questions has been always most meritorious cheers believes that i would be for the imperial parliament to settle it either prior to or concurrently with the establishment of an irish parliament hear hear we know that also is the view of lord spencer lord granville and lord herschell but on the other hand we knew that the radicals of england violently oppose any solution of the land question by the imperial money upon it we want to know what is going to be the liberal policy are they going to settle it themselves or are they going to allow us to settle it or are they not going to offer any solution we require a definite answer to these questions and if they ask as sir william harcourt asked that ireland was to make up her mind we say that we are entitled to ask them make up your own mind loud cheers there is another very important matter i have always said that the land question has always been and still remains the great impediment in the way of obtaining the restitution of our legislative rights the other great difficulty is not english public opinion but it is irish protestant opinion and fellow countrymen it is of the utmost importance that we should do everything we reasonably can to assuage the alarms of those men who live amongst us in every quarter of ireland in greater or lesser numbers hear hear to give them every guarantee that is possible that they will not be injured in property or sentiment when ireland recovers the right to rule herself hear hear and not only to give this assurance and guarantees but to abstain from any action tending to show that any section of the irish electors allow any religious body to influence their opinions cheers i know of no greater mischief from this point of view that could be done to the irish nationalist cause than the action of certain persons during the kilkenny election hear hear which unhappily has been followed up in many parts of ireland by an activity and a course of conduct from the same body of a most deplorable character hear hear i for one raise my warning voice against this and i appeal to the manhood of ireland to say that they are sufficiently intelligent and sufficiently independent bravo to make up their minds upon the great issues before the public without the exercise of any undue influence cheers a voice no politics from rome hear hear mr parnell all these practices have recently given only too much ground to many amongst our enemies to cavil against and to doubt the fitness of some at least amongst us for the great tasks and duties of self government now i have for you an illustration which i disclose now for the first time of the total misconception on the part of many amongst the english members of the relative positions of england and ireland in this alliance i said in limerick that it was the alliance of a nation with a nation cheers a weak nation and a poor one if you like with a rich and a strong one but that this alliance did not mean the absorption of the smaller by the greater hear hear and that it did not mean in any way the surrender of our independence cheers let me give you an illustration of this absurd misconception on the part of english radicals of the position of our party towards their party and of our country towards their country last year i think it was towards the close of the year before last or during the year before last i was waited upon by a delegation of three members of parliament who stated to me that they represented and were deputed to see me on behalf of the radical members of the house of commons a body numbering about or strong and that they had greatly to complain of my action with regard to mr balfour light railway scheme in the west of ireland that they looked upon these schemes as being a bribe not only to the irish members but to the irish constituencies that the action of the irish members with regard to these plans was fatally injuring the cause of home rule in the english constituencies and they called upon me as leader of the irish party to lead the opposition against these light railway bills on pain of inflicting damage upon the home rule cause if i neglected to do so i explained to these gentlemen in reply that i had taken no very special action one way or the other that i for one had not opposed them and that i still declined to oppose them that they were measures of some utility in the west of ireland that england was extracting from ireland an excessive sum in taxation from us that the amount of money to be spent on those works was only a small requital for this excessive taxation that they would give employment to many labourers of these districts and help to keep many irishmen at home who would otherwise to be obliged to emigrate to america thereby causing permanent loss in the irish national strength and i repelled with indignation the insinuation that these measures could be a bribe either to the irish members or to their constituencies and that these gentlemen would find when the liberals came into power that the irish members would allow themselves to be bribed neither by the tory government nor by a liberal government as for the constituents they were tough enough to stand any amount of that kind of bribery laughter and applause the three delegates retired in great indignation and it is one of the things they have treasured up their sleeves for me from that day to this it is one of the causes it is portion of the motive power of the torrent which has been loosened against me from the same source because they know that they have in me a man as leader of the party and leader of the nation applause a voice we will have no other leader mr parnell who knows his own business as good deal better than they do hear hear and who is determined to submit to no dictation from englishmen and that we shall not allow any bribery either from tory or liberal applause my position to day is the same as it was in committee room no hear hear this is not a personal question you are told that you will lose home rule unless you throw me overboard never a voice we will if we did mr parnell and unless you prostrate yourselves at the feet of this shrine of english prejudice you will not you can't lose home rule the idea is preposterous on the face of it the justice of the cause which has been admitted by half of great britain and which is admitted by the whole of the civilised world is not going to be denied because sir william harcourt hisses tells ireland that unless she chooses to do certain things she ought not to get home rule now i don't wish to say anything about sir william harcourt to day because we have not come to the period of fighting yet cheers but if that time ever arises and i hope it won't i shall have a few things to say about him which will prove to you that the man who is the successor in the leadership of the liberal party to mr gladstone a voice morley mr parnell no indeed harcourt will and he will be the leader of the forty five seceders hisses a voice never ours cheers mr parnell and he has addressed to you an insolent and audacious letter which you have all read he is a man whose leadership we cannot entertain or recognise until we are assured beyond yea or nay that if that party come into power they will give to ireland the home rule that we expect to get that gentlemen is my position and i believe that the longer that this question is discussed and turned over in your minds the more strongly convinced will everyone of you be that not only have i taken the right course but the only possible course that i could have taken with my knowledge of what is moving under the surface and the springs and motives of english political men and the views of english political parties and the feeling of the english people towards ireland with the slightest regard or consideration for the duty which i owe to this nation cheers i don't desire in this struggle which is in many ways most repulsive to me to see a great and powerful party which i have spent so many years in building up and which i asked you in to help me to build up torn asunder it has been a bitter blow to me to see the irish people divided upon this question to be loaded myself with every contumely and insult that the vile and malignant ingenuity that my chief opponents can suggest or invent voices healy prolonged hissing all these things would have induced me and directed me to avoid this battle if i could have done so i have no desire to fight and do not desire it now fight cheers and i shall only go into it if i see that duty absolutely compels me a voice it does cheers as to which road that duty will be in regard to my own course and action i have nothing to add the part i could do towards that solution was effected when i came to an understanding with mr william o'brien cheers a fortnight ago i know not what has happened since i know there has been great delay but it is not of my origin hear hear i made up my mind twenty four hours after my first interview with mr william o'brien as to what i should do and ought to do and i told him so the fortnight delay has been a delay on the part of my opponents and not on my part cheers i know not what their mind or will may be or what action some trembling or vacillating politicians have decided on taking but i do know if there is no possible solution of this question the fault will not be mine cheers but theirs and that the public opinion of ireland will recognise i have to day spoken truly to you prolonged cheering\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with loud cheers and cries of no surrender said mr mayor fellow citizens and friends from lismore golden and croghaleigh i thank you from the bottom of my heart for your most eloquent and most wise addresses cheers i appreciate them most highly and when i examine the list of the bodies from whom they proceed i ask myself what element of national strength of irish patriotism and of democratic sentiment is wanting from the list none and cheers i find in this list representative and organised bodies all that goes to make up the strength of public opinion and the forces of national sentiment in this and the neighbouring counties and in this locality i regard it as a great and remarkable omen of the strength of the public opinion of ireland on this question that i should have been presented with fifteen such addresses as these from bodies so representative so important and so leading the public sentiment of ireland i should like to speak to you at considerable length but i do not wish to trespass upon your kind attention for more than a very brief period go on it is right that i should say a few words to you of more than a formal character they had addresses from the city branches of the national league of waterford when i last spoke in this city these branches were not in existence and it was feared much time might elapse before public opinion would be advanced enough in this country and city to enable the formation of a branch of the national league does not the interval how sic the giant strides that the cause of ireland has made does not the fact that you have now in addition to the national and literary club in this city the united trades club the trade and labour union sailors and firemen union the waterford board of guardians all these falling into line many of these bodies sprang into existence since those days does it not show that the organised public opinion of ireland is indestructible and all powerful cheers i am glad that these organisations have been formed in your midst cheers i appreciate and i wish well the efforts of those humble men to better their condition i trust that these exertions will be always successful always tempered by a consideration which i am sure will be always present in their mind that to them and the workingmen and artisans and labourers of ireland we look as no small portion of our national strength hear hear i trust that these organisations may be successful in bettering the condition of the working classes while referring to this question i should tell you that in the house of commons on friday night i and a few colleagues who remained faithful to me cheers some dozen in number i am sorry to say we were not many but we gave a vote on behalf of the labourers and artisans of great britain and ireland and especially on behalf of the most reasonable claim of the railway servants for a reduction in their hours of labour a vote which ran within seventeen of defeating this powerful government of lord salisbury and which would have succeeded in defeating this government and in placing the cause of the labourers of the three kingdoms and especially the railway servants of the three kingdoms on a strong and sure foundation if the seceders who were resting from the exhausting labours incurred in committee room no hisses and from the labours of the conflict in kilkenny if they had been in the house of commons on friday night as a matter of fact if they had been in the house of commons then they would have beaten the government by a majority of sixty unhappily however the irish party is unfortunately not at present the powerful party that it once was if that party had remained true to itself first of all next to their country the result of the division of friday would have been very different cheers i pass from this topic however and i continue the reflection that the city and the county that is able to show such a front and solid organisation need not fear for the future and that i am proud to have had to day as i have always had the organised support of the men of waterford cheers at a time when of all times in my public life i have needed it most and fellow citizens let me tell you in addition that perhaps you and i have approached this subject from different standpoints the standpoint from you which you have approached its creditable to you and i hope that in the days and years to come the standpoint from which i have approached it will appear to the whole of ireland to have been creditable to myself cheers you have approached it from the point of view of chivalry and generosity you have said here is a man who has stood by us through many a long year of trial of danger of difficulty and of doubt and we know that he has never misled us cheers we know that he has always been true to the irish cause cheers and that he has shown as far as he could in very difficult circumstances his desire to help the interests of all classes in this country hear hear and though we may lose a great gain for ourselves and ireland in the future we decline to desert this man cheers or allow him to be trampled upon cheers that was the position and attitude which has raised you immeasureably sic in the eyes of the nations i believe that you have not lost by that generous and chivalrous attitude but it was not an attitude which i would have asked you to take up under any circumstances it was not an attitude that i should have looked to you to place yourselves in for a single moment and if i had believed that you could have lost anything by standing by me i would never have allowed this issue to go before you i would at once and at the commencement have stepped down from the position in which you placed me and worked in the ranks under the leadership of any other man until your regeneration and your hopes for the future had been fulfilled to the highest and fullest extent cheers but i knew and was firmly convinced that ireland could not lose anything i believed the contrary the general shaking up and the understanding which undoubtedly will be arrived at between ireland and england as to the solution of this question which you can accept as a permanent and final solution will be a great benefit to this country hear hear i have felt that i was somewhat to blame in being too soft and amiable to the grand old man in these negotiations and that it was my duty to set these matters right and to enable the irish people to take up their negotiations where they were left by the hawarden communications i have done that i have been accused of a breach of faith and a number of other hard names have been hurled at my head but my conscience is perfectly clear upon these points i know that i have done what it sic right and what will be justified by the best interests of ireland in the future as i said a while ago i know perfectly well that you will lose nothing by this that it is not a question of home rule or no home rule but that it is a question of a large and great measure of self government which will enable the irish people to really govern themselves in matters of domestic and irish concern while impairing no english interest or injuring no imperial power or right cheers that is the position which ireland takes up and fellow countrymen the alliance of no english party is worth your consideration which is not sufficiently powerful to carry such a settlement for any other would only end in disappointment in bitterness in renewed strife between the two nations these are considerations that i commend to you they are sensible i am convinced they are just i believe they coincide with your sentiment and with your common sense they are self evidently true and i am sure that the more the english and irish peoples study this great question the means by which a solution of the long standing dispute will be arrived at the more i am convinced that ireland and england will ultimately say that the leader of ireland was right when he declared he was primarily responsible for a settlement which could not have been a perfect settlement which could only have given rise to further troubles and perhaps to throw back the irish cause for years even for generations whatever happens fellow countrymen the responsibility is no longer upon us we have declared our position it is open before the world we are willing to make peace with england but we the irish members and the irish people are not willing to become the puppets in the name of self government and under the protection and shadow of a mock parliament of any imperial authority or any outside influence loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell then came forward and was received with a great outburst of cheering after referring in warm terms to this loyal co operation and support he had received from mr leamy mr r power and mr harrison he said the question of the evicted tenants to which my friend mr harrison has referred is a question about which i want to say a word or two we had an address to day from the cloghaleigh evicted tenants in the county of tipperary presented by themselves who came here to present the address these are men who were evicted in the old land league times ten years ago and whom we have protected from that day to this their farms were taken possession of by emergency men but they have never faltered and i don't i go beyond the mark when i say that there is a fair prospect that these heroes will be in possession of their farms again and will soon occupy again their own hearths and their own homesteads and i shall have to congratulate myself upon the fact that we have stood by these men we have protected them during this long interval and they have never lost courage nor lost heart and they will yet have obtained a settlement fair to themselves and their families and honourable to their country cheers i draw no distinction between the evicted tenants of the old land league times and the evicted tenants of the plan of campaign cheers i have over and over again pledged myself that no evicted tenants should suffer that the last shilling of the national coffer shall be expended to save and to protect them and that if necessary we will beg the world in their behalf i renew that pledge to night cheers last week after mr mccarthy groans had locked up the national war chest i compelled him to unlock it and placed in the hands of wm o'brien for the protection of these tenants cheers if i were leader of the plan of campaign i would have first before a drumhead court martial the men who sought to create panic in the hearts of the evicted tenants and i would have tried them condemned them and executed them cheers the evicted tenants stood firmly they refused to be panicstricken or to betray the cause of ireland cheers they said as they said from the beginning we did not enter into this fight for the sake of our own interests we entered into it for the cause of ireland and in it we will stay for the cause of ireland even if ireland deserts us but ireland they knew would not desert them and ireland did not desert them cheers so the evicted tenants are safe enough loud cheers the people who have been endeavouring to create panic and to cut my throat are now ashamed of themselves because their design has been exposed as the design of traitors and mutineers in the national cause now i want to say a word to you on the amnesty question i want to tell you men of waterford that the question with which my mind and heart and soul have been identified from the first moment of my entry into politics has been the question of amnesty and it was the question of amnesty which founded the home rule movement which brought myself and others into irish life without it we never should have existed it was owing to the upheaval of feeling on behalf of those imprisoned sufferers in that isaac butt was able to form the home rule movement without which movement we never should have had an independent irish movement and remember then that whatever of hope whatever of encouragement and bright prospect of happiness for the future exists for the irish people exists on account of the prisoner in his prison cell cheers on account of the men who have suffered on the scaffold and in penal servitude for you they are the men whose sufferings led to the foundation of our movement and without whom we should be nought if motives of humanity do not compel you to consider these men then you should reflect upon what has moved the main springs in the hearts of the irish people which have produced so much good for you to day and motives of gratitude should compel you to bring to your recollection and to your hearts the sufferings of men like john daly and egan cheers and others so of them innocent some of them perhaps guilty they were tried by partisan juries several of them tried and condemned by foreign judges and juries under foreign law languishing to day hopelessly and helplessly but with patriotic hearts and instincts in those dungeons oh my countrymen we ought not to forget them while we say and know that the dynamite movement was not a movement which we could do anything by condemn we also know that none of these men had a fair trial that many of them are undoubtedly innocent and that all of them are actuated by as honest motives as any of those whom i address now and we ought not to forgot sic them cheers we ought to insist upon fairplay for them when they remain in prison cheers we ought to see that there is no suffering visited on their defenceless heads now i pass on to the future and i tell you that the future is bright for ireland we may be broken we may be divided but i know that there is by a small fraction or section of the irish parliamentary party who have dishonest hearts and these men thought that circumstances gave them their opportunity but their opportunity did not come they were mistaken and their opportunity never will come cheers the heart of ireland is sound and you must not reckon in the ranks of the opponents of ireland every man who makes a fool of himself to day because the prescience and the knowledge of public affairs and the patriotism which you have in your hearts is not given to every irishman you must then have toleration for your weaker brethren you must give them time to consider the great interests involved and the great interests before them you must give them time to come to their senses i wish to do that i wish that no amount of provocation should tempt you or me to any action of retaliation and above all things we should keep our tempers knowing that we are on the winning side cheers and keeping our tempers at the same time we will keep our grip and we will show an example as statesmen of knowledge and prescience to the rest of ireland let us tell those who seek to mislead us that we don't judge them harshly and that we will not retaliate we have something else to do besides striking blows against brother irishmen and will not continue this fight if it is to be fought against the majority of my countrymen i am willing to fight against the english enemy if england is to be our enemy but if england offers us the right hand of friendship and acknowledges our equal rights and supreme power over our own affairs and over the interests of ireland now i am willing as i have always been willing to shake hands but if it is to be a fight we shall fight it with all that is solid in ireland with all that is patriotic behind us and with the majority of our irish people behind us cheers and i tell you my friends that my heart is as strong to day and my frame is as strong to day as it was ten years ago cheers i am willing as i was then to go into the lobby as one irishman against englishmen cheers i am willing to fight this battle over again to tread this weary road again with the same confident heart that we shall win it and while i tell you this i believe that we shall not be called upon to array the strength of ireland to the fight but the voice of ireland will be heard by england and that your position will be recognised by england and by the nations of the world and that you will have added one further testimony to all those proofs you have given from time immemorial of the fitness of the irish people for self government and of the right of ireland to be a nation loud cheers\n",

      "my friends from sligo mayo and galway it gives me the greatest gratification and inexpressible pleasure to receive these numerous addresses presented as they are by all the most prominent leaders of public opinion in the counties from which they come presented as they are by the men whom i recognise as having formed the cream of our army cheers in the struggle and coming from men who have shown in every phase of sacrifice and suffering that was required from them from time to time that they do not know how to shrink from their duty cheers you will remember when mr gladstone a voice down with him and cries of order order mr parnell sought to dismiss me from your service cries of never he brought to an abrupt conclusion the negotiations which he and i were conducting in the hope that a satisfactory measure of legislative independence for ireland might result from them he ruptured those negotiations by his action in writing that letter and i had to look round me in considering my course to see upon whose shoulders my duties in continuing those negotiations were likely to be deputed by the majority of my parliamentary colleagues cries of down with them i found that my successor would probably be mr justin mccarthy groans a gentleman of great amiability of character but not with much practical acquaintance with the wants of ireland cheers and i came to the conclusion that the future conduct of these very difficult negotiations could not be entrusted to his hands cheers and that it was my duty without loss of time to lay the point at which they had arrived and the difficult questions still unsettled before the people of ireland cheers my account of the difficulties the great and practical difficulties was contradicted but my account to the very letter has been verified by subsequent results hear hear it was denied that the question of the constabulary and of the judicial bench were in an unsettled and unsatisfactory condition but the publication of my original letter to mr rhodes the premier of cape colony cheers written to him within three months after the hawarden negotiations in which the passage occurred that owing to the unsatisfactory state in which the question of the control of the constabulary and the judicial bench had been left it would be fatal for us to give up our full representation in the house of commons completely proved that those two matters had been left in an unsatisfactory condition cheers and the publication of mr justin mccarthy assurances which he says that mr morley says that mr gladstone has given to him completely prove that the land question was also left by those communications in an equally unsatisfactory condition hear hear now i have no doubt that man interpretations will be placed upon these third hand assurances made to the public through the mouth of mr justin mccarthy and it is in the nature of everything that comes if it is supposed to come from mr gladstone that a great many different interpretations can be placed upon them laughter but let me tell you shortly what my interpretation is of them and i take the only sensible interpretation i don't propose to go into this matter to day i shall have other opportunities in other parts of ireland of going more into detail especially in the matter of the constabulary but i will say speaking generally that it does not appear to me that the question of the constabulary has been placed by those assurances in any more favourable position than it was left under the bill of as i explained at limerick some weeks ago the bill of did not propose to transfer the police to the irish executive at all it proposed that while that force subsisted they should remain under the control of the imperial authority it also provided for the creation of a civil force of police to be placed under the control of local authorities throughout ireland but as regards the constabulary that force was left indefinitely as i said in my manifesto by the bill of under the control of the imperial authority in ireland and there was no provision whatever in the bill for stopping recruiting or for disbanding the force or for disarming it or for getting rid of any of the abundant power which the imperial authority possessed now in ireland by statute to levy an armed force to police in perpetuum italics that position appears to me not to have been altered by the assurances with regard to the police question recently given by mr justin mccarthy groans the constabulary will still remain under the control of the imperial authority in the country none of the acts giving that power will be repealed there is a sort of pious opinion expressed that by stopping recruiting and in other ways not mentioned the force may be got rid of after a period of five years but allow me to say it seems to me utterly impossible to suppose for a single instant that a force of armed men can be got rid of in a period of five years by any expedient contemplated in these assurances and that much more probably a period of fifteen years would have to exist even supposing we could guarantee the continued good will of successive english governments in ireland which would be all we would have to depend upon for the practical dissipation of this armed force of policemen the position my friends i have taken up with regard to the irish constabulary is a very simple one it is capable of being defined in a few words in such a way that no man can misunderstand it and i am confident that it is capable of being defended upon the grounds of justice reason and equity cheers you have here a swollen force of policemen enrolled for the purpose of collecting rack rents for the landlords intimidating the people and preventing practical freedom in this country hear hear these men are armed as soldiers we sympathise with the opinion that has been expressed that it would not be proper to hand them over to us in their armed condition but i pointed out that it would be perfectly simple perfectly easy to disarm them to diminish them in number if you like and then to transfer them in a civilised and civilianised condition into the hands and under the control of the irish executive responsible to the irish parliament the alternative proposal conveyed in the assurances of mr justin mccarthy is not to my mind a practical one this police force can't be got rid of in five years it is utterly impossible they are enlisted with right to draw their pay so long as they behave well until the period of their superannuation arrives and i think i am under estimating the period which would be required if recruiting were stopped to morrow to get rid of and to disband this force if i state it at fifteen instead of five years the only reasonable plan to adopt is to alter the character of this force to give them batons instead of rifles and bayonets and revolvers and to transfer them in this altered shape or such of them as might be necessary for the purpose to the control of the irish executive responsible to an english parliament cheers no other course i tell you my friends is compatible with irish freedom cheers it is impossible for freedom to exist in this land so long as the imperial authority has the right of meddling in our affairs by the appointment of a police force the irish police were instituted with the design and for the purpose of crushing out stamping upon and keeping down irish liberty cheers i stand here to day to express my belief which i believe is the belief of the irish people and which i am sure will soon be the belief of the english people that no legitimate freedom or liberty is possible in this country until the statutes are repealed which give this inequitable unjust and unreasonable power to the imperial parliament to meddle with affairs which are admitted by recent legislation to be essentially local and domestic cheers now let me go on to the question of the land cheers we have got them as far as this by a good deal of pushing squeezing and exhortation of various kinds laughter to admit that if the imperial parliament does not settle that question the irish legislature should be entitled to settle it but a great deal will depend upon how this provision is enacted under that statute in fact everything will depend upon it hear at first sight and at second sight and from whatever point of view you may look at it it appears unreasonable and inconsistent that where a proposal is made to give ireland power to manage her own affairs the only affair which is of any importance in the country should be withheld from her cognisance and jurisdiction hear that is the situation of the land question the question which has been so bungled and mismanaged by the imperial parliament during the ninety one years since the union that half our population has been banished from the country or starved to death and the remainder of the population until the establishment of the land league was unable to hold up its head in the presence of the landlord agent or bailiff as they walked along the road hear hear they say that they are going to try their hands at it for another five years in the imperial parliament what does that mean it means two very important things it means in the first place that the imperial parliament will take a pretended settlement of this question and having made that pretended settlement they will say that they have settled it and that the irish legislature is not to be entitled to have any power over the matter in the second place it means another thing of great and immediate importance to the tenant farmers of ireland recollect this that in regard to the great majority of the holdings upon which judicial rents have been fixed that fifteen years tenancy created by the act will expire certainly within the next five or six or seven years that will be the period in time covered by the limit within which they seek to keep this matter under the jurisdiction of the imperial legislature and the new tenants will be created and the rents will be fixed under conditions prescribed by the imperial parliament and not settled by the irish legislature those new tenancies will continue for fifteen years and for the first fifteen years of an irish parliament you will have a constabulary with their rifles their sword bayonet and all other paraphernalia under the control of the imperial government and collecting the rackrents fixed by the imperial parliament cheers now i think i have said enough upon these two points and i have scarcely touched upon them to show you that these two questions these two vital questions are left in the most unsatisfactory condition that it is a mockery to talk to us about giving us rights for the management of our own affairs so long as these questions are left in that unsatisfactory condition and that we have got to preserve our ranks unbroken to refuse to ground our weapons until we get some more satisfactory assurances and some considerably more satisfactory ones than anything we have yet upon the subject cheers but who says that they are satisfactory no one i have not heard that even any one of these seceding members down with them in public or in private have ventured to say they are satisfactory they state that they wanted to hear what i had to say about it first laughter as a reason why they should not be called upon to commit themselves but these gentlemen are leaders themselves they have got their own leader why don't they ask their leader to say what he thinks about them he knows nothing i want to know my friends whether any of these gentlemen are coming over to ireland themselves they are afraid to tell any of the irish people privately that they regard these assurances as satisfactory i venture to predict that no one of them will hear hear now my friends a large mass meeting is waiting for us outside several of my most talented colleagues are with me in this town and we must leave time for further though shorter speeches in the public square later on so i will ask you to adjourn loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with great enthusiasm expressed his gratification at the spirit which the men of roscommon had displayed and his confidence that the men of the west of ireland would see that the cause of irish legislative independence was safe cheers they should insist that what they had been struggling for should be settled permanently that the land question and the police should be given into their control cheers he had pointed out to them yesterday something of the depth of the plot which had been set on foot to prevent a settlement of these great questions and he had told them that the refixing of the judicial rents would take place in the interval since this movement commenced the last fifteen years of their life had been passed in watching the puny and fraudulent efforts of the tory government to deal with the land question but they would not allow them to waste another fifteen years and have the tenant farmers staggering along under their load of rack rents he was glad that the air had been cleared and that the issues had been plainly put before them public opinion in england would plainly show that the people of the country were right in the stand they had taken and moderate and reasonable in the demands they had made cheers with public opinion solid and united they would triumph over every obstacle until they saw that the fruition of their hopes ireland a nation had been realised loud cheers\n",

      "men of belfast i first wish in anticipation of to day proceedings to say a word of welcome to you for the strength in which you have come to this town from belfast to join in this great demonstration i hope to have an opportunity very soon of coming amongst you in belfast applause i am proud to find that the nationalists of belfast are as good men as they have ever been and that they do not intend to allow themselves to be put down by dictation that they will show that they understand their own business quite as well as any english minister as i have said i trust very soon to have an opportunity of appearing in belfast and of speaking to the thousands of my fellow countrymen there applause i could not resist the temptation of saying a few words to you in advance of to day to tell you how much i appreciate the numbers with which you have come down here to this city to day applause i think fellow countrymen that the lesson taught by the presentation of these addresses is one of the most remarkable which has been presented to the gaze of the irish people during recent times hear hear we have listened to these patriotic and eloquent sentences breathing the spirit of true courage in every line hear hear with admiration almost with wonder because we know how extraordinary and how dastardly have been the means used in the districts from which these deputations come to stifle with public opinion hear hear and cheers to prevent the manifestations of the true sense and will of the people upon these questions to intimidate and to destroy the national aspirations which have prompted this assembly to day hear hear i deeply appreciate the courage of the men who have come as representing the belfast leadership committee hear hear the national league hear hear the castlewellan committee the armagh independent club the armagh gaelic club the grenan national league and all those organised and representative bodies from this town of newry cheers what element is wanting to show that the public opinion of newry and the neighbouring counties is overwhelmingly in favour of an independent legislature cheers and against the ridiculous attempts which have been made by our english or by some of our english allies to dictate to us in the management of our own affairs be assured fellow countrymen that your names will be long remembered as those of men of independence and of courage and of patriotism hear hear sustained by that judgment which has done so much to make our movement in those latter years a victorious and overwhelming one cheers now i do not wish to speak to you at any length because a great mass meeting awaits us and i am warned that the time is approaching for the commencement of our proceedings there but i should like to say one or two words to you representing as you do the leaders of public opinion in the different places from which you come and as you are undoubtedly the leaders of that opinion i should like to say a word to you upon the matters which i felt it my duty to bring forward at the commencement of this struggle when the consideration of our attempts to obtain a solution of the irish national question by means of our alliance with the british liberal party necessarily became public and subject to the judgment respectively of the english and irish peoples we have heard of the assurances which mr justin mccarthy groans says he has obtained and it is necessary for us to scrutinise these assurances very closely because it would be absurd to say that the estimable gentlemen who claims to be the leader of the irish people laughter possesses the confidence of the people whom he assumes to lead or any of the attributes which are usually supposed to belong to the position standing as i am in the town which will be for ever associated with the memories of john mitchel cheers i am reminded that the present leader of the irish nation did not scruple when he was only an english historian a voice not the present leader cries of no no mr parnell to traduce the name of john mitchel by disseminating the false and cowardly libel that john mitchel had been guilty of a dishonourable act in escaping and to propagate the calumny that he had broken his parole that i suppose is one of the claims on which justin mccarthy rests his present position laughter and groans but whether mr mccarthy and his donkey cart loud laughter and cheers for united ireland represent or any of the forty four leaders groans who are dragging and pulling and hauling him in every direction first one way and then the other represent the aspirations of the irish nation time will show hear hear anyhow the men who support me do not believe that he does loud cheers the sic say that we shall require something better than his assurances or the knowledge that he has to conduct the future negotiations regarding the solution of the national question before we give up our grip or surrender any one single power or weapon we have in our hands to day cheers now i pointed out that these assurances left the solution of the land question in the hands of the imperial parliament for such a period of time as would ensure that the next judicial rents the next judicial tenancies on the expiration of the original terms of years would be fixed by the present land commissioners under the control and appointed by the imperial authority that is a very important matter for you in ulster hear hear because your judicial tenancies were fixed earlier than those in many other parts of ireland and though it may not be so with regard to some of these tenants in munster and other places more especially the leaseholders who have had their rents more recently fixed yet undoubtedly the next judicial tenancies of ulster if these assurances are to be accepted as satisfactory ratified by you and carried out as a result of the next general election will commit the fixing of the judicial rents upon the farmers of ulster to the present commissioners who have fixed your present rackrents upon the farmers of ulster to the present commissioners who have fixed your present rackrents cries of never and the constabulary because it is known that the existence of the constabulary owing to these rackrents and for purpose of collecting these rackrents will still be necessary are to be retained under the control of the imperial authority until these fresh judicial tenancies expire at the end of the fresh term of years now you will think that a lame and impotent ending to all our struggles a very poor reason for giving up your leader and the right of appointing your leader cheers if you find that the only reward that justin mccarthy is able to offer you in return for these sacrifices is that you are to struggle on for another fifteen years under these rack rents and that the constabulary are still to be allowed to trample upon your liberties the destiny even the name of freedom and pull the roof from over the heads of your wives and families this is not the result that we contemplated my friends when we went into this struggle with the war cry of down with landlordism cheers this is not the result that i contemplated when i formed an independent irish party applause these are not the things that i then pledged myself to you to do and i will be no party as long as i have breath and strength and any irish constituency to support me i will be no party to surrendering our birth right or to accepting a mock and sham settlement which would leave our future irish legislature tied by a leading string to any english political party loud cheers the line of demarcation is broad and clear between imperial and irish national affairs we do not desire to trespass upon any prerogative of the crown we do not desire to injure any imperial interest or to lessen any imperial control over these matters which belong to the greatness and the dignity of the empire but we do insist upon this and we will accept no settlement as final which does not secure it that we shall have control over our own business and especially that that power that usurped power which now belongs to the crown of levying and maintaining and arming a body of constabulary shall cease by repeal of the statutes which now give that power applause now my friends i was much pleased to receive addresses from organised bodies representing the workingmen of this town hear hear newry is one of those national towns apart from orange towns which excels in those industries which go so much in those days to make up the strength and future of a nation hear hear i wish we had many more national towns like newry hear hear your artisans are famed for the excellence of their work hear hear and i am glad to find that steps are being taken to organise the workingmen of this town so that they may be able to look after their own interests we recognise of course that owing to the comparative absence of industries in ireland we cannot take a leading part in the great labour movement which now occupies so much attention in great britain but we can assist and show that the brotherhood of nations so far as the interests of the working classes is concerned is solid as between us and great britain applause and while workingmen in ireland recognise that above all things and beyond all things they are irish nationalists and that their first fealty and duty is due to their motherland and to the aspirations of our future nation they are not precluded from joining hands with the english working classes in obtaining those fair alterations in the laws now regulating and oppressing many industries which are so necessary for the future well being sic and prosperity of these classes applause as regards the question of what ought to be done for the benefit of the working classes which programme ought to be laid down you will not expect from me any definite pronouncement to day these matters are occupying now the attention of many minds i shall have an opportunity of speaking upon these subjects in england and also in dublin shortly hear hear to a meeting of representatives of labour and of industry from different parts of ireland hear hear i take this opportunity of referring to this movement to say that i am confident that the working men of ireland and the artisans of ireland to whom we look so much upon whom we depend so much for the future strength of our nation are determined that the irish representatives shall remain independent applause and that they shall yield to no english influence applause it gives me fellow countrymen fresh hope if fresh hope were necessary to find that the frontier town of ulster is so strong upon this platform a voice it will be the bunker hill of the seceders cheers mr parnell and has never yielded one single inch and that i see around me the representatives of all that is strong and determined in irish nationality cheers ten for the one that i had fifteen years ago cheers aye a hundred for the one renewed cheers if my army of to day is so enormously larger and stronger than it was in those old years why should i be afraid cries of no no why should we be afraid since we know that the only result of this crisis has been to wipe out the traitors cheers and the weak kneed and the cowardly from our ranks cheers to enable us to consolidate our new irish army renewed cheers with which we shall advance to victory final and complete and satisfactory to our people in the near and immediate future loud and prolonged cheers\n",

      "the first time that i ever had the honour of coming to your town was before i was known as a public man it was in at the funeral of that honest irishman my predecessor in the representation of royal meath honest john martin cheers it was from his lips that i learned the principles of irish nationality and the duties that belong to an irish representative and i can search my heart and my conscience to day and i can truly tell you that never in thought or in word have i been false to his teaching cheers and when the history of these times comes to be written when many things are known that are not known or understood to day when the details of the boulogne negotiations if they received satisfactory assurances with regard to two vital questions they stipulated that the question should be decided by them by my enemies as to whether those assurances were satisfactory or not and i agreed to that i agreed to leave the judgment to them to my enemies to the seceders i think that in doing so i went to the verge of weakness hear hear and that i conceded too much but i stipulated that they should proclaim by resolution whether they considered these assurances satisfactory or not and when they got mr gladstone answer cries of down with him they came back to that room and refused to keep their side of the bargain they refused to say whether that answer was satisfactory or not and they ran away out of the room they claiming to be a majority ran away coward like before the minority and they slunk off into a hole of their own and they pass a resolution behind the back of the irish party deposing me from my position cheers and since then they have been looking for further assurances they have got assurances but they have never ventured to say that these assurances are satisfactory there is not any one of them at any meeting in public or in private will venture for a moment even to whisper that this settlement can be accepted by the irish people as satisfactory what then is the good of talking about the great things mr gladstone is going to do for us and the great things that ireland is going lose unless she sacrifices her independence of judgment upon the two most vital questions of all the two questions which have led to more trouble and more suffering than any other questions the questions of the constabulary and the settlement of the land they tacitly admit that no solution is offered to us which we can accept for one single instant with any hope or confidence that the result could be satisfactory to the peace and prosperity of ireland and to the prospects of a peace between the two nations cheers i have shown my bona fides by offering to retire if it was made evident that the things that you are going to get as a consequence of my retirement are the things that they say you will get and having submitted that simple test to their honesty and to the honesty of the liberal leaders it has been shown that we have nothing to expect from any english party if we ever allow the independence of the irish members to be sapped or destroyed hear hear what is the solution of the land question that they propose i dare say there are many of you tenant farmers here the solution of the land question is that it shall be left to the imperial parliament and the present commissioners to fix the next judicial rents when your year tenancies expire in the course of the next or years and that for years you are to struggle along under the load of rack rents which have become so oppressive that even a conservative government is forced to reduce them for a period two or three years back and that during that coming fifteen years of rackrents the constabulary the armed constabulary are to be retained under the control of the imperial authority for the purpose of collecting these rackrents now an irish parliament may be a very good thing and will be a very good thing if it has full powers over the destinies and interests of ireland but it will be worthless it will be a broken reed it will pierce the hand of the irish nation restinging sic upon it unless it has these full powers hear hear it is absurd to ask us to face the future with any confidence if these great and important questions are to be left for solution in the hands of our enemies hear hear under these circumstances irishmen would become a laughing stock they would justly merit the future and the fate of slaves if they accepted such a settlement such a maimed and dependent parliament a parliament which would be a travestie sic and a burlesque upon the declarations at dungannon and the dreams of grattan applause if our countrymen were to accept the promises and assurances of any english party for recollect every english leader has coerced or imprisoned or evicted our people by turns hear hear i do not want to go back to the bitter memories of the past or to revive rancours which we all hope some day may be buried but these bitter memories can only be buried upon one condition that there is power given to our people to watch over and guard the future destinies of our nation applause power to hold what we have go and we will except no maimed and impotent settlement of this question applause now i have spoken of the coercion of both political parties but who was it who taught lord salisbury government how to coerce cries of gladstone what party was it who put a thousand of us into jail without trial in groans for gladstone what party was it who passed the crimes act of a voice the grand old humbug groans mr parnell under which these removable magistrates first came into existence what party was it who instituted the power to levy blood money and to tax small portions of ireland for extra police what party was it who wrote all these things in large letters upon the statute book why it was the liberal party it was the very men who now tell you that it is your duty to hand me over never and to pitch me into the common ditch of the camp the irish people accepted my declaration of years ago that there was a fair hope and possibility of regaining our national rights by means of an independent irish party hear hear i did not pretend to you then that it was possible always or for ever to maintain independent members at westminster i told you often and often of the grave dangers the insidious influences which are always at work to sap the independence and integrity of irish members there hear hear i told you to beware of those influences i told you then that without an independent party i would take no part in parliamentary action i stand here to day unhappily to commence a great deal of my work over again i face the future with courage cheers because i know that my army is stronger more numerous better educated and better equipped than it was in cheers when we were few in numbers i cheerfully look and with confidence for the decision to be given by the irish people and i will submit to no other decision applause and if that decision should be in favour of the slavery of our race and the dependence of our people upon any english political party or statemen i shall bow to it and i shall retire from constitutional agitation loud cries of never and from public life i shall admit my failure while regretting it never but i will never be a party to misleading the men who have stood by me the men who have given me the position which i hold to day hear hear and i will never ask them to thrust in a weapon which will then have proved to be blunted and corrupt applause but fellow countrymen i am confident that that time will not come and that the decision of ireland when she is given the opportunity will be clear and decisive and although we may not have as numerous a party as we had in it will be more solid it will be stronger its principles will be clearer sharper and more independent hear hear and that with such a party we shall secure the respect of the english people and of the matters of the world we shall regain the legitimate freedom of ireland we shall obtain for you the right of making your own laws at home applause racy of the soil power to protect all the suffering and languishing interests of our country power to guard the future of our nation the principles of legislative independence and of irish nationality cheers and above all things the power when we have won our freedom to hold it loud cheers\n",

      "your chairman has given me rather an extensive invitation to express my opinion upon the very important and the large programme of labour reform which you have decided upon to day and although there are some points in reference to this programme which i should wish to reserve my judgment upon yet upon the whole i am glad to find myself in a position to be able to congratulate you upon the very solid and sensible way in which you have occupied the time of your conference applause i am glad to be able to find myself in agreement with you upon many of the important reforms which you have advocated an agreement not come to yesterday because the subjects which you have deliberated upon have been in my mind for many years past hear hear i have formed my judgment upon most of them and if i have not chosen to declare my judgment upon many of them if i do not choose or do not think it right to declare my judgment to day upon some of them it does not follow that i have not formed a judgment hear hear i need not say gentlemen that i esteem it a very high privilege indeed to have an opportunity of addressing you upon these important subjects and questions i consider that you have honoured me much in extending the invitation which you have given me to be here to day coming as it does from a non political body hear hear it it sic additionally important applause and i can assure you although i believe that the sentiments of the vast majority composing this assembly are politically speaking in accordance with my own hear hear yet at the same time i can assure you that i will in no single word or expression trespass beyond the line within which i ought to confine myself having regard to the fact that this is undoubtedly politically speaking a mixed assembly hear hear you have traversed as i have said already a very wide field and the question which you have considered most of these questions i think that i can speak clearly and freely upon even to day it has been said of me that i have taken no part in the great labour movement which has done so much to raise the hearts and the confidence of the workingmen of great britain and ireland as regards their future a movement of recent birth but of great import and undoubtedly of great strength hear hear that is quite true i had an opportunity at clerkenwell of explaining the reasons why i was not free until now to speak my mind upon these questions and why i am even now not entirely free to speak my whole mind upon them it is not necessary for me to go over that ground again but i think it right to make one reference to an observation of mr davitt at a recent christening i suppose we must call it laughter and hisses and cries of order of a new political organisation that i had attempted to prevent him from proceeding with the formation of the labour organisations in the south of ireland now let me tell you what actually took place shortly after mr davitt had been to cork i received a very indignant letter from a prominent clergyman a canon of that city directing my attention to mr davitt proceedings and asking me to send him a letter which he might publish holding up mr davitt to public opprobrium as a man sowing dissension in the irish national ranks i did not reply to that letter i thought it an unworthy request to make of me in the first place hear hear and in the second place i thought it right to see mr davitt before even considering the request that was conveyed to me in that letter by that clergyman and to ask him whether it was true that he intended the formation of this new organisation to act as any element of disunion in the irish national ranks and i did see mr davitt the first time he came to london i saw him privately in reference to the matter and he assured me that nothing was further from his thoughts than to use the new organisation as an element of disunion but that on the contrary he thought that by showing the irish labourers that they were not neglected and that something was to be done for them as well as for the farmers that it would introduce an element of strength into the irish national ranks and that same time he expressed himself perfectly willing if i desired it to write to his friends in the south of ireland and to say that he did not intend to take any further part in the movement i was perfectly satisfied with mr davitt explanation i did not ask him to withdraw from the movement that movement has progressed from that day to this and it is still in existence and there is no truth whatever in his recollection that i asked him to stop the organisation or to interfere with the movement in any way whatever applause now let me proceed to a further consideration of my relations with the liberal party i have no doubt it has not yet been said but i have no doubt that it will be said that i opposed labour candidates in england and brought about their defeat i did do so i did do so because as an ally of the liberal leaders acting in negotiation with them i was bound in england to carry ought their policy and when they asked me to use my influence and direct my organisation for the purpose of defeating labour candidates who were started against the liberal candidates at the bye elections in england i was bound so long as i remained in alliance with them and fighting by their side to do what they asked me to do hear hear and undoubtedly at the election for mid lanarkshire i directed the whole strength of the irish national league of great britain against the labour candidate keir hardie and went a long way to ensure his defeat and i did so against the earnest request of a very dear friend of mine who has my telegram regretting that i could not support mr keir hardie on the occasion i did so against the earnest request of that gentleman a man whose sincerity and honesty of purpose on behalf of any cause which he undertakes needs no vindication from me i mean mr cunningham graham applause now i have explained to the labour men from time to time that so long as i occupied this position towards the liberal leaders it was impossible for me to strike out any separate policy from theirs as regards the selection of candidates for constituencies in england my course in ireland of course was free and would have been different but as regards my action to candidates chosen by the liberal leaders i was bound to follow their lead so long as i was in alliance and in communication with them i was bound to fight with them whether they were right or wrong it is true that it would have been proper for me to have advised them in private to consider the claims which were made by the english labour organisations and to make room for labour candidates in great britain wherever they could and i did that from time to time i strongly urged that view upon the liberal leaders my position however now is a free one applause and i can fight for any side that i pledge my adhesion to applause and i can point to the history of my past my political past and my public life for years and i can ask you or any other assembly of men in the world whether any cause or interest that i have ever supported has not advanced appreciably owing to that support hear hear and whether i have ever betrayed or failed in supporting at any critical moment any interest or cause that i have ever pledged my adhesion to applause and cries of never now mr chairman i come to the details of your labour programme and i would say that the principle of manhood suffrage and of one vote for every man to apply to all elections parliamentary municipal and poor laws has my earnest sympathy and will always receive my practical support applause as regards a universal legal eight hours day i do not see that i ought whatever it may be right for you to do founding a programme which may take years to carry out to its fullest extent i do not think that i ought to go further than i went at clerkenwell or that you ought to ask me to go further than i went there when i said that the principle of an eight hours day has my hearty sympathy hear hear i believe it is right i should be glad if the day could come to morrow when no working man was compelled to work more or was allowed to work more than eight hours in the day applause but i have to regard my position towards larger interests even that the interests of labour and i have to consider what would be said or what motives would be imputed to me if i allowed my sympathy for this principle to carry away my judgment the movement in great britain is dealing with a great and complicated system of manufacturing industry which has taken years to create and to bring to its present perfection and i have never been able in considering this question of eight hours to see how it will be possible to establish a universal compulsory eight hours day by law in great britain until you get the same principle recognised in these countries which are in manufacturing competition with great britain hear hear that is the view that i take of it i think it is a question for organisation on your part i think it is quite right for workingmen and for artisans to express their opinion in favour of an eight hours day for all trades if they think that it is right and i think it is also a question for international negotiations hear hear and it will never be settled satisfactorily until there is such a comity of nations brought between the workingmen of the different countries as will compel either the employers of labour in those countries or the legislatures of these countries to adopt this principle hear hear then as regards the question of legislative interference i am entirely in favour of legislative interference for the purpose of taking the place of strikes and combinations i think it is a mockery to a great extent a mockery to tell the working men of great britain or of ireland to rely upon strikes or combinations to gain ends which the legislature ought bring about by legislative action hear hear i do not believe that the working men fight on an even footing in these strikes and combinations they cannot successfully contend in nine cases out of ten against the enormous combined capital of capitalists and although they may in many cases wage a successful fight and after great loss and suffering to them and some pecuniary loss to the manufacturers gain some particular principle or some special alleviation of the conditions under which they carry out their industries and their labour yet in my judgment it is not a fair fight and it is specially a question in which the legislature should take from time to time well considered action for the purpose of introducing those reforms which public opinion point to from time to time as being necessary and expedient for the good of the working classes loud applause political economy to the wind i would throw what is called political economy to the wind you may depend upon it that when you have obtained universal suffrage and even if you do not obtain it the text books of political economy will be very materially altered within the next few years the men who write these books write them for their market they write them for the people who are able to pay them and when the electoral classes by their increased educational knowledge and by their increased political power are able to get the men who write these books to devote their brains and their talents to their service you may depend upon it that those notions which now possess currency as full of accurate maxims of political economy will be very materially changed and altered hear hear as regards the workingmen of great britain and of ireland i believe that their lot will be one of speedy and rapid improvement hear hear the power which the constitution gives to the masses the political power which it gives the power which it gives them of influencing the elections and of using their force for returning members of parliament is a growing and an increasing one and all of us politicians are bound to recognise it and even if we do not sympathise with you we must now sympathise with you in order to maintain our political existence applause so that it will undoubtedly come to pass that many things that seem extravagant and unexpected and unheard of in these days will be thought very little of in a few years to come nationalization of the land as regards the remaining points in your programme including the question of the nationalisation of the land and the immediate advocacy of taxation of all unoccupied and untilled lands including grazing lands i have always believed in the principle of the nationalisation of the land as being the correct one but i have not believed in the crude theories which have been put forward by certain persons for the purpose of carrying out principle i think it perfectly right that taxation should be taken off food and other things and thrown upon the land perfectly right and i shall always support legislation in that direction that is what the object which is called nationalisation of the land proposes to effect with that object i am in thorough sympathy and i should hope that the numerous tenant farmers who will in all probability become owners of their farms within the next few years under the present land purchase bill of the government will bear in mind that the course of future legislation will tend very much to take the burden of taxation off the producers and to throw it upon the land and in making bargains with their present landlords they ought to remember that the taxation on land for the purpose of education for the purpose of promoting the industrial resources of ireland and for the benefit of the working classes is bound to be materially increased in the future and that they should leave a very wide margin for themselves in the making of those bargains so that they may be sure that when they have become the owners or future occupying owners they may be able to do their duty to the landless masses of their fellow countrymen who have stood so gallantly and valiantly by them in the struggle for their hearths and homes applause taxation of unoccupied and untilled land i notice that in no a most valuable and an immensely valuable proposal namely the one which proposes the taxation of all unoccupied and untilled lands including grazing lands what i should like to see done with regard to it speaking as a practical agriculturalist is this it has always impressed itself very much upon my mind that the lands of ireland are practically uncultivated hear hear there is as much employment given to agricultural labourers on one acre of land in england as there is upon fifty acres of land in ireland now i don't think that is an exaggerated statement i doubt whether it comes up to the mark i believe then speaking as a practical agriculturalist that we might raise double the amount of agricultural produce off our irish land if we tilled it properly and judiciously and i should like to see the law of rating altered in such a way as to enable the local authorities to exempt from taxation all land which is tilled in this country and all land which is not occupied under grass for a longer period than five years that i consider would tend in the direction of enabling large quantities of land which are now imperfectly cultivated and which as a consequence are not producing one fourth of the produce that they should produce to be brought into proper cultivation by rotation of crops and it would undoubtedly promote the employment of the starving agricultural labourers of the country generally applause the other proposals then as regards the taxation of ground rents in towns and of unoccupied houses that of course is part of the english programme and it is a part which i cordially agree with the general promotion of all irish industries that is a question that i have been identified with ever since i was twenty years of age and i need not tell you i am entirely in favour of it extension of the factory acts and so forth extension of the employers liability acts that is a technical subject promotion of the building of labourers dwellings and the lowering of their rents with the extension of allotments for labourers cottages and the application of the agricultural dwellings act to artisans that i consider to be most valuable resolution out of which i may be possible shortly to obtain immediate fruit undoubtedly the increase of the labourers allotment from half an acre is desirable i suppose i shall be blamed by and by for having only made it half an acre laughter but i thought it was a good thing to get at the time and i think still it was a good thing to get but there is no doubt that having regard to the intermittent employment of labourers to the fact that they are only able to obtain employment during a small portion of the year it would be a great matter for them if those allotments could be increased and that they could be given two or three acres instead of the half acre they now have and i really don't see whom it would arm i believe that it would lessen the rates and enable those poor men to get through the winter months when they are without employment without coming upon the rates and asking for outdoor or indoor relief hear hear i don't see how the farmers could object to it because there is plenty of increasing these small allotments and i am quite sure the farmers would not grudge any extension of the kind but whether they grudge it or not it ought to be given the extension of the principle of the labourers act to artisans in towns and especially in the country towns would i have always thought be a most important improvement of that act we were not able at that time to extend it further than it went but unquestionably and especially as regards the country towns in ireland the field for such an extension is self evident and most needed i shall be most glad if we can persuade the legislature and i do not see why after a time we shall not be able to do so to apply the principle of the labourers acts to the case of the artisans to enable houses to be built for them in the small irish country towns and to give them small allotments in the neighbourhood of those towns which they might cultivate in their spare hours hear hear i do not know that there is any other question that i need refer to except those on which i am notoriously agreed with you namely those as to the shortening of parliaments the direct employment of labour by public boards the abolition of contracts for public works and so forth all these are questions upon which any advanced thinker must be in agreement with you and i am glad to concur with you as a whole in the very excellent programme of practical reform which you have drawn out but i will ask you not to press me to declare myself further than i have done at clerkenwell upon the question of a universal eight hours day of labour or upon the question of what is called the nationalisation of the land further than i have done to day as regards the other matters i think i can fairly say that i am in general and practical agreement with you cheers mr chairman i thank you very much indeed for the opportunity you have given me of attending the proceedings of this conference and of expressing my own views i look upon it as an exceedingly high privilege i have always looked to the workingmen and artisans of ireland as likely and necessarily likely to form the greater and the stronger portion of the future irish nation and therefore i have always been disposed to do anything i could from time to time to benefit those classes you will probably say that the results of my exertions have been small no they have undoubtedly been small but at least they have been honest and wholehearted you have conferred upon me this vote of thanks but i can assure you that i feel that the obligation has been conferred by you upon me in permitting me to be present here to day i recognise that an organisation such as this coming together as it does from all parts of ireland has within itself in all probability the nucleus of a great and powerful movement i desire that it should also be a well considered one i am sure that the men whom i see around me will direct their movement so as to secure that no national strength or interest shall be weakened hear hear but that with the growing contentment and increasing prosperity of the working classes our whole country of ireland may be mutually benefited and mutually increased in prosperity hear hear that i am sure is the wish of every one of you it is the necessary corollary of your movement great good will undoubtedly result to all ireland to all classes in ireland to all interests in ireland from the organisation of the working classes i feel that to the bottom of my heart and i wish that there was a hundredfold more scope for the organisation of skilled and unskilled industry in ireland than there is unhappily at the present moment we have need of organisation we have need of journals to represent the labour interest and i am glad to see that a newspaper racy of the soil the irish labour advocate has lately sprung into existence cheers the workingmen will i am sure see that it is for their interest to support this journalists enterprise to see that its circulation is increased and that every encouragement is given to the very spirited and talented efforts which are now being made from week to week on behalf of the irish labour organisation and interests by the irish labour advocate as regards the question of labour representation in parliament it is natural and right and proper that irish labourers and artisans should wish to be represented by men who from practical experience know their situation their struggles their trials and their difficulties and i am glad to be able to say that we have in the ranks of my own small remaining party two men who have worked as workingmen i mean mr blaine and mr patrick o'brien who is now in kilmainham applause the one worked as a clothier and the other as a marine engine fitter in liverpool and i am told and believe it to be true that they are both properly qualified tradesmen in their respective branches i will only say as regards my own wish in this matter that when the time comes although my capacity is not as great in the direction of securing easy and tranquil passages for would be members of parliament as it used to be laughter i shall do everything i can whenever feasible opportunities present themselves applause it is a very legitimate desire and one which is well calculated to advance the cause of labour in conclusion i thank you most heartily for the opportunity you have given me of listening to and studying the conclusions which this most important conference has arrived at and of expressing my views upon them i fear that i have been rather tedious cries of no but i trust that great good will result from our interchange of views and i feel sure that the cause of labour in ireland and also in great britain has been materially advanced by the result of to day proceedings cheers i have much pleasure in supporting the vote of thanks to our worthy chairman for the dignified and courteous way in which he has performed his duties i wish also to say in reference to the resolution which has been passed calling on all irish members who desire to support the workingmen to be in their places on wednesday next to support the miners eight hours bill that i don't believe any of us or at all events very few of us will be there unfortunately we are at the present moment engaged in an internecine strife which entirely prevents us from being there with any public advantage either to our constituencies or to the cause of the workingman or to humanity until order has been restored in the irish national ranks until one side or the other has gained the victory and has put down the other side the utility of the irish parliamentary party as a voting party and as a party for the purpose of gaining reforms of any kind will be absolutely nullified i thought it right to make this remarks because i myself shall probably be fighting my former comrades in the county of sligo on that day a voice to beat them cries of order mr parnell and i dare say a great many of them will be in the same position opposed to me also in the same county i am sorry that this should be so but in all probability the practical disadvantage to this particular motion will not be great as until after the next general election when in all probability there will be a larger representation of workingmen and of members sympathising with workingmen ideas in the house of commons there would be no chance i should suppose of getting such a measure as this even if it struggled through the house of commons which would be most unlikely through the house of lords i thought it right to mention this matter to you as i don't wish to sail under false colours i am most pleased to have an opportunity of supporting the vote of thanks to your honourable and intelligent chairman who has borne such a notable part through many years of discouragement and drawbacks in the service of the irish labour cause\n",

      "fellow citizens and men of the county of cork cheers it has been my happy fortune to witness many great demonstrations in this city but never have i seen a greater a more numerous and a more enthusiastic one cheers it gives my heart comfort and strength to come amongst you now as always and i shall go from you a better and a stronger man to fight for the cause of ireland great cheering it was your former member joseph ronayne cheers and honest john martin who first taught me the principles of irish nationality cheers and the people of cork from year to year perfected that instruction and am i now going to take my lesson from any english political party cries of never or from any english statesman no no they forsooth are to be the judges of whether i am fit for my position or not cries of they are not and you are fit and who are they they are the men who tried everything they could to break down the spirit of the irish people cheers and ireland claim to irish independence who tried to break it down by coercion by the prison by penal servitude aye and by the scaffold cries of gladstone and groans until they were taught that the spirit of irish nationality was inextinguishable and that only by recognising that spirit could they ever hope to find a solution of the irish question cheers now these men you have said are not to be my judges cries of no but i have always been willing from the first to submit myself to your judgment cheers and i say to day to those gentlemen who talk so glibly about driving me out of public life and out of ireland that i am willing to go to my constituents to morrow cheers if my colleagues in the representation of the city will do so renewed cheers a voice you'll be elected mr parnell i came amongst you a stranger in cries of no no and you took me by the hand then a voice and will till death cheers mr parnell you accepted my declaration cheers a voice and will again mr parnell and when i come before you again in real fight if there is to be a real fight for my seat in cork i am confident that you will return your verdict that in no single respect have i been false to any pledge that i ever made to you and that not having been false you will give me again your suffrages and your confidence despite every influence as in the past loud cheers men of cork you know what this struggle is cries of dictation it is a struggle in the first place to preserve and restore the independence of the irish parliamentary party cheers i never magnified the efficiency of parliamentary action to you it is quite possible that when i first began i did not scarcely believe that we could bring ireland into such a great position by parliamentary action at westminster i only have seen the weakness of the position of any irish parliamentary party i know well the influences the thousand and one influences which are at work constantly to corrupt the independence and the strength of your members i know that these influences while they are numerous are many of them invidious and unseen and having regard for the weakness of human nature it is not surprising that some amongst my colleagues should have yielded to the pressure and panic stricken flew like sheep before the voice of gladstone hisses some of them were frightened only some of them were undoubtedly dishonest and traitors cries of healy some of them unquestionably were place seekers looking for the opportunity to betray you when the time arrives hisses but thank god ireland is to day awake and she is determined to take securities for the future against any weakness or traitorism sic in the ranks of her people at home or in the ranks of her representatives in london we have now the opportunity of doing it and our people will take those securities when the next general election comes cheers now what are those securities i told you in that no irish member should take place or pension until the just rights of ireland had been conceded cheers but many of those say to day that if we got a parliament or even a shadow of a parliament without any real power without control over the constabulary hisses without power to settle the land question and with a heavy impost upon us of a contribution towards the imperial exchequer that then they might be released from their pledges and that they might take place or pension now that is not my view hear it is evident to me that even when a control is conceded important powers will be reserved for us and that it will be more than ever necessary still to continue and to assert the independence of ireland representatives cheers because such a body without control over these great and important questions would have no real power to guard over and to protect the interests of the irish people loud cheers and if the irish members were then to be permitted to take situations from mr gladstone hisses your liberties would be just as much at the feet of english ministers as they have been any time during the last ten years hear hear so fellow countrymen let you remember this that the day when ireland surrenders her independence of thought of judgment and action whether to an english party or to any body of men within her own borders when she surrenders her right to shape her own course when she surrenders her right to choose her own representatives and her own leader loud cheers when she ceases to trust in herself for her own future and her own redemption when she loses her high courage and her proud spirit when she forgets her proud past and the sufferings of her martyred dead loud cheers when she learns to trust to the good will and the good faith of any english political party a cry of down with english parties or any english statesman then indeed may we say but not till then that all hope for the future of ireland a nation and or the prosperity of our people is lost and gone but fellow countrymen i stand here to day to declare in your name my belief and my confidence that that day will never come great cheering that you will always know how to hold aloft the banner of irish freedom and of irish nationality and that whether we have to fight for one year or for ten we shall never give in to the dictation and we shall never forget the lessons our gallant forefathers have taught us prolonged cheers\n",

      "mr president of the trades council of cork it gives me the greatest pleasure to have heard from you the very interesting statement of the views of the trades of cork with which you have favoured me i am glad the statement has been so full because it will save me from the necessity of inflicting upon you a lengthy reply the trades of cork the tradesmen of cork have always been amongst my staunchest supporters hear hear they have also been my most unselfish supporters because as has been truly said the movement of which i have been the leader has been able to do very little but harm for the irish trades we commenced this movement for the purpose of benefitting no section of irishmen we originated the movement of the land league as i said at galway in for the purpose of obtaining irish legislative independence and if we devoted our energies mainly to the advantage of the tenant farmers it was because they were the most numerous class in the country the most important interest and for many other reasons it is not necessary for me to go into detail with you because your judgment and perception have long ago understood and recognised these reasons but in seeking the legislative independence of our country i undoubtedly had in my mind the interest and the prosperity of all classes and especially the workingmen hear hear and trades of ireland applause the trades struggle on a barren soil under great manifold disadvantages and it is to your credit that you have been able to retain many of the industries in which you so much excel in the few manufacturing cities we still have in ireland hear hear we honour and respect the men who compose those trades for their industry and for their skill and we especially honour them for their patriotism and their love of country in helping us against their interests in the great movement of the national league for my own part i have never been jealous of the organisation of labour and i never intend to be applause i was one of the first who formulated the principles for the irish agricultural labourers that he should be independent as regards his home the roof over his head his little plot of ground of his employer and hold it not subject to any employer i was denounced for that by the late john bright who only said that the root of all irish distress and backwardness in trade was due to the number of irish holidays laughter the ameliorations we were able to obtain for the agricultural labourers were not great but they were an evidence of good will i think they were laid on right lines and on sure foundations which can be made surer the organisation of labour in the south is undoubtedly most important i could a tale unfold with regard to the foundation of the movement and the attempt that was made to put a stop to it you may probably guess to what i allude and that i refer to a prominent ecclesiastic in the city who interested himself in the matter i am glad that you approve of the programme which was adopted at the labour conference in dublin and that mainly on the speech i made and that you think it is sufficient at all events for the present and that you do not ask me to go further in my declarations than i did at the conference on saturday i did not then repeat what i said at clerkenwell i said at clerkenwell that i thought certainly the railway servants all engaged in unhealthy and dangerous occupations all miners should have their hours of work fixed at once by the legislature to the limit of eight hours all government employees policemen too i suppose laughter should have their hours of work fixed by the legislature you will have an opportunity doubtless of reading that speech and you will see the extent to which i am willing to go with regard to the question of a general eight hours i am entirely in sympathy with that i think it is quite long enough for any man to work and especially for men who have to work by manual labour i think the period of eight hours is quite long enough hear hear but there are questions connected with the competition directed against the manufacturing industries of great britain by other nations which enter into and as i think forbid a wider application of the principle than that which i have mentioned on the question of strikes i am glad that you agree with me that strikes should be rendered unnecessary by the intervention of the legislature and by the constitution of boards of conciliation with compulsory power to settle those questions which arise from time to time as regard mines and quarries i think it would interest you to know that on wednesday last in london i gave evidence before the royal commission on mining royalties it could not appear in the papers because it is supposed to be confidential and although i have a print of my evidence i could not at present publish it but i think without any breach of confidence i can give you an outline of what it was i think i was the first irish witness that was called and i may say that there was a great deal of interest taken in the question of mining industries and industries of a similar character in ireland by the members of the royal commission they questioned me fourteen or fifteen of them on three points and asked me for my opinion as a practical man and as one who had considerable experience for a number of years they asked me as to the probability of these things for various parts of ireland i proposed that in regard to royalties which are in the possession of the owners and which have already passed to the new occupying owners under the ashbourne purchase act that the board of works should act as a board of arbitration with power to intervene and compulsorily adjudicate and to decide where anyone with the bona fide italics intention of working the property is desirous to work it and the owner refuses to allow him to work it or asks such an exorbitant royalty as to render the working of it impossible the board of works should be allowed to intervene and give permission to the adventurer to work the property and decide as to the amount of royalty with regard to the lands that are likely to pass in the future to occupying owners i recommended that it should be made a condition of the purchase that the owners should transfer the royalties without charge to somebody say the land commission to be held in trust for the future county councils which undoubtedly will be established in ireland within a reasonable distance and that these county councils should have power to deal with these royalties upon a systematic plan and should also have power to make experiments in boring and otherwise for the purpose of testing the different coal fields which exist in ireland their depth capacity and so forth my suggestion is on all fours with the suggestions which the president made mr mcnamara quite so mr parnell those suggestions would apply of course to both mines and quarries it will be my duty or that of one of my colleagues to direction attention to the question of the haulbowline docks which has been brought before my notice to ask that they be properly equipped and that they be given a share of the government business and properly equipped that is to say that government ships should be sent there i don't see why they should build a ship here hear hear the representation of labour is a matter upon which i think you are entitled to ask me whether we can afford you facilities for being represented you must bear in mind however that our power in this direction is not so great as it formerly was we shall be fighting the next general election under great disadvantages and i am sure you will not ask me to run the risk of throwing away a seat in order to give you the opportunity of contesting it but i shall always be glad under favourable circumstances to do so cries of no no in conclusion i will only say that i have always looked to the workingmen the tradesmen and the artisans of ireland as forming the framework of our future irish nation i should be untrue to my trust if i neglected any opportunity if i failed to strain every nerve to advance their interests to increase their numbers and prosperity that would tend to the success of irish industries hear hear we have to look to you men as the most important wing if not the main body of our future irish national army and ireland without trade without industry but merely as an agricultural country never can be a nation and one of the great functions i hope in our national irish parliament and one of the reasons why i shall insist upon is a suitable financial arrangement being granted to you that will enable us to devote some millions a year to the promotion of irish industries and the development of irish resources will be my belief and not a belief of yesterday but one which has been always in my heart and my mind that without a great expansion in the industrial resources of ireland without a great increase in the numbers and in the prosperity of our workingmen and our artisans our future irish nation will be maimed and incomplete cheers\n",

      "fellow countrymen it was in that i first had the opportunity of addressing a meeting near this spot and i endeavoured then to obtain your confidence for the movement that i was just then commencing a voice yourself and biggar cheers mr parnell i endeavoured to explain to you the principles upon which i proposed to act and i am happy to say you accepted these principles and i believe you will agree with me that from that day to this i have carried out the declarations that i then made faithfully and truly cheers and while i endeavoured to teach you a lesson as to what could be done by parliamentary action i also learned a lesson and my first one upon the great question and which during the fourteen years that have elapsed from that day to this still remains untouched and pressing for solution i refer to the agrarian question in the west of ireland and especially to what are known as the congested districts of connaught my visit to you in was a revelation to me as to the gravity of this portion of the irish land question had i not seen with my own eyes what i saw then of the condition of the smaller tenantry of these districts had i not again to day seen with my own eyes as i came along the railway to your town the same condition still existing in its poverty and its misery it would have been incredible for me to believe that the rich and powerful government of great britain could have allowed so large so industrious and so deserving a class of the subjects of the queen within eighteen hours of westminster to remain so long in squalid poverty and in deplorable distress it was what i saw in this locality and in this county of sligo and in mayo that year that made me say when the land act of was introduced in the house of commons that that measure would be useless to save or succour the distress of these poor people what did the land act do for them it lopped off or per cent of their rents after the process of an action at law with a barrister and an attorney against their landlords to the smaller tenants of connaught it was like offering a stone for bread to a starving man on these small holdings there exists one quarter of a million of the tenantry of ireland a matter which calls for the attention of the legislature what are these little patches of land they are lands that have been reclaimed from the hill sides and the peat bogs and the little thatched constructions that have been placed there by the labour and at the cost of the tenants and these reclaimed lands would be useless even to feed a snipe or a goat were it not for the tenant labour bestowed upon them it is for these lands and for these cottages that these smaller tenants are asked to pay rent i have declared before now and i renew my declaration to day that to talk about compensation to the landlords for these small holdings is a mockery and a robbery cheers if any compensation is to be given to them at all it should be only a nominal one cheers there was once a great man who travelled through the west of ireland and who investigated very closely the condition of this class of the tenantry i refer to general gordon cheers who was afterwards slaughtered at khartoum and he left it on record as his opinion that these tenants should be purchased out on compulsory expropriation at a small sum and that they should be left to hold their tenancies in perpetuity practically free from rent cheers they are as i have said small but they are large in numbers if they are small in value and it has been calculated that a sum of from eight to ten millions sterling would be far more than ample compensation to the landlords for their rights as landlords over these men this would not be a large sum for the rich government of great britain to spend for relieving the lives of these people from slavery cheers and if that were done it would be a work nobler than the task for which the united states of america spent so much blood and treasure the freedom of the slaves of the southern states of america loud cheers for the condition of these people is far worse than that of any of the negro slaves that ever existed in america and let nobody say that the irish question that the irish land question has been settled until this grave problem has been grappled with a bold hand and then you can face the future with some hope and confidence cheers having spoken so much on this question i want to say something about a matter which is occupying your attention just now you have two candidates you have a man who bears the name of dillon cheers a voice an honest man from ballina mr parnell a first cousin a confidential and a long tried friend of the prisoner of galway jail john dillon cheers on the one hand you have on the other hand an alderman collery groans of sligo no doubt a very estimable man in his own town but a gentleman who so far as i know has never done or suffered anything for ireland or before been ever heard of in irish public life it is said against mr dillon as a reproach by the seceders groans that he is a solicitor which appears to me to be rather a comical objection coming from a party of who have attorneys in their ranks laughter and i know these fourteen attorneys of their very well by long experience i know mr dillon by long experience and speaking of him as a solicitor i would say that i would prefer dillon as a solicitor to the whole of them put together and as a man and an irishman i would rather have one valentine dillon than certainly a good proportion of the forty five traitors and deserters groans and there is one thing that you may depend upon alderman dillon that he will not run away because a grand old man makes a face at him cheers he is of that stubborn mould which would prefer to put its back to the wall and die fighting than to march out with the honours of war which the seceders certainly did not do when they beat the hasty retreat from committee room we hear a great deal about the excellencies and virtues of mr gladstone hisses and the liberal party but i want to ask anyone of you who are electors of sligo what were the principles upon which you elected your representatives in was it as followers of mr gladstone or the liberal party cheers and oh no did you not elect them to be independent of english parties places leaders and influences did you not elect them to obey your leader first and foremost and not take their orders from any assembly or body of englishmen outside ireland would you not have expected that when these men were asked by an english statesman to depose their leader whom they had pledged themselves to support that before deposing him they would have come back to ireland and taken counsel with you and if they had done that and not been in such a frantic hurry to obey their master gladstone would not this deplorable disunion in our country have been avoided by some means or other cheers would not every patriotic and sensible irishman in the country if they had not been in this tremendous hurry if they had given ireland time to think and the leaders of public opinion in ireland time to take counsel together would not have been enough judgment and patriotism in ireland to settle this question if this strife had been removed from the heated atmosphere of committee room and from the foul influences of the national liberal club would there not have been time enough and patriotism and judgment enough in ireland to have found some way out of the difficulty without bringing about this deplorable and terrible schism in the national ranks of ireland loud cheers i do not imagine it to be more than weakness with many of the seceders groans a great many of them with more strength and experience have the making of very good men in them son of them too are sons of men who probably would never have made very great parliamentarians or experienced statesmen but who were possessed of good intentions but others of them unquestionably are cowardly and some few of them have hearts of black malevolence towards their comrades and myself only bursting to vent and give expression to it groans and if this small and black hearted minority had not urged and egged the inexperienced men and the faint hearted men and cowardly men in our ranks the whole situation would have changed and we would not to day have to deplore the split in our ranks involving heart breaking work upon everyone of us work which we would gladly have avoided which we would have given much to avoid but which we must fight out until ireland has decided whether her future is to be in the hands of any english parliament or minister or whether our nation is to be master over her destinies free within our own land to protect and cherish the interests of all classes and with power when she shall have her freedom to hold it loud cheers i am confident that we shall be able to say before the end of this struggle is ended that the west is awake and that we shall have at our backs the solid ranks of the men of connaught pressing forward with us to victory cheers until we have once more reunited our party and our nation

      "people of castleconnor it gives me the greatest pleasure to have this opportunity of advocating in your midst the candidature of alderman dillon the first cousin of that eminent and patriotic irishman john dillon and when we are asked to consider the claims of the rival candidates we find that you have in val dillon a man whose name has been before the irish public for the last twenty years and who has been foremost in every good work and who spent his childhood and boyhood in your midst on the other hand you have in alderman collery a man who until yesterday was unknown and has no claims to rest on at all cheers i wish to say a few words to you upon a question which is of the utmost importance to the people of this district it was in upon my first visit to the west that my attention was directed to the nature of the land question in what are now known as the congested districts and i lost no time in bringing the result of my knowledge before the house of commons for in i pointed out to the legislature the necessity that existed for protecting the interests and securing the future of the smaller tenants in the west of ireland i showed when the land act of was passing through the house of commons that that act would do but little for the smaller tenants and i tried to do something better for you in in the passage of the arrears act cheers from which i have no doubt that some of you derived some benefit a voice a great benefit mr parnell since that year of many eminent statesmen have visited these western counties where these small holdings exist in such profusion and my contention of is now admitted by everybody and by all political parties that a measure of relief will have to be adopted for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of the scenes of distress in your midst that is now admitted even by mr balfour who visited the west of ireland and who went back impressed with the same thing now let me tell you what i have always had in my mind as to the only solution of this portion of the land question many years ago that humane minded man general gordon who was killed at khartoum visited the west of ireland and he declared that these small tenants should be relieved by a bill for compulsory expropriation of the landlords interests cheers that rich england should consent to pay back some part of the money for the cost of this purchase and allow these tenants to stay on their lands practically free from rent cheers the only value of which is that created by the labours of these tenants cheers it would be but a small measure of justice of restitution to those tenants who have paid the fee simple of their holdings in rent which was not made out of the land but by the people going to england and scotland and by bringing back their small savings to pay the landlord cheers well if the rich english nation refuse to buy you out and make you free men i say that they should allow your irish parliament to buy you out by giving irish bonds to the irish landlords cheers my calculation is that the sum of money necessary to secure the happiness of two hundred and fifty thousand small tenants would not be more than from eight to ten millions of money the annual interest on which would not amount to more at the outside than about four hundred thousand a year it would be well worth that sum for the rich government and people of great britain to do this good work this act of restitution if they do not do it we will do it when we get out parliament that we should have a good financial arrangement with great britain and that we should not be crushed down by heavy imposts on us in the shape of monetary contributions to the greater and richer country and that the financial arrangement should be such as to leave us a margin after paying our debts to enable us to free the small tenantry of connaught and to free our general countrymen cheers and now i want to say a word in reference to the statement of the chairman in reference to the benefits that we were able to obtain when the leaseholders were admitted to the benefits of the act of i have a bit of private history to reveal to you upon this matter that act admitted not only i suppose forty or fifty thousand leaseholders who obtained a considerable though insufficient reduction on their rents but it also reduced the rents of the judicial tenants by fifteen per cent in a period of three years cheers that admitted a most valuable proposition for it admitted that the judicial rents were too high cheers well when that act was before the house of commons mr timothy healy groans did his best to obstruct it to death and to prevent its passing groans he declared publicly in the house of commons that he would never agree to its passing groans and i had to take him by the neck to stop his obstruction in order to enable the irish leaseholders to get their reduction cheers and this is one thing against me now because i used my authority on that occasion and on many other occasions to prevent these men and other traitors in the irish party from ruining the interests of our country groans for healy and now fellow countrymen i leave you confident that castleconnor is safe against every interference and that when the day of the poll comes you will put the man with a good name and a good past at its head and that you will refuse to join the cowardly band of seceders and traitors to destroy and sell their leader at the bidding of an englishman never to destroy and sell their country to england if they get the opportunity never i am confident that the men of this district will put their foot down on these snakes and scotch this treachery in the bud and that no other part of north sligo will go more solid for the cause of independence than this district cheers\n",

      "mr chairman and citizens of toronto i thank you for perhaps the warmest welcome which i have received since i have crossed the atlantic cheers this welcome sufficiently dispels the calumny which was heaped by the pro british press upon the people of canada that they did not sympathise with the suffering people of ireland your actions before we came here had indeed sufficiently dispelled that calumny but i am glad that you have also reserved some of your sympathy for our mission and while you have showed before our arrival that your hearts were opened and this your money was ready to alleviate the distress of ireland so also your wish to help in preventing the recurrence of the distress cheers many people when they hear of famine in ireland look upon it as a dispensation of providence they think that is sic due to a bad harvest or that there has been too much rain or that the soil of ireland is poor and unable to feed our population but none of these reasons apply in the case of our irish famine which are cause by men and not by god cheers they are artificial and not natural famines the soil of ireland is not poor it is capable of supporting twice her present population in abundant prosperity and happiness our climate is the most genial in the world our people are not idle and slothful they are energetic and hard working when they are working for themselves as men cheers now how is it you will ask that every ten or fifteen years we have frightful famines in ireland the argument is sometimes put forward that the people of canada and the united states have no right to inquire into the cause of irish famines but those who speak in that strain should recollect that this is the third that the world has been appealed to within one generation to feed starving ireland and it is a fact that the irish people of this country as well as those of the united states send annually large sums of money to help the irish peasants to pay their rents from reliable statistics we know that between eighty and ninety millions of dollars have been sent from the continent of america to ireland within the last twenty years and that nearly all of this money instead of going to make those to whom it was sent more happy and more comfortable has gone into the pockets of their landlords applause i believe that the people of canada like the people of america are concerned whenever they see that there is a suffering nation and they consider that their duty as a practically free country is to help ireland to attain that position of freedom and that self government which they themselves possess cheers the land tenure now we charge that these continually recurring irish famines and that the state of chronic poverty which always obtains in ireland are due to the conditions of land tenure in that country and what is that system of land tenure it is the old feudal system with which almost every european country started and which has been tried and found wanting and abandoned in every civilized country except great britain and ireland and the tenant farmers of ireland having tried this system have come to the conclusion that it high time it was abandoned in ireland also applause for in no country has the system inflicted more evils upon the country than in ireland and now you will ask what remedy have you to propose well we have almost got tired of proposing remedies we have been proposing remedies for the system of land tenure in ireland for the last thirty years and we have not been able to obtain any hearing for it comparatively speaking it comes to this that the british parliament which cares nothing whatever for irish public opinion will not be moved upon any irish question until its attention has been directed to it by some very forcible and out of the way occurrence applause mr gladstone himself speaking upon the question of the disestablishment of the church in scotland the other day in midlothian said that it was not until a prison had been broken into in the heart of the metropolis alluding to the clerkenwell affair and a policeman shot in the discharge of his duty in the city of manchester that the disestablishment of the irish church entered within the domain of practical english politics now this is a very good example of the difficulty which besets the irish in obtaining any reform from england i would like you to understand our position upon this question we do not blame the english people so much or think them responsible for the state of affairs in ireland although they are responsible because they assume the government of the country remember i draw a very great distinction between the people and the government of england and when i say england you will recollect that i mean the government of england a voice what sort of government would you have for england cries of put him out mr parnell the people of england have put themselves in a very important position with regard to ireland they have taken a position which no nation ought ever to take i hold that every nation is able to govern itself applause and that although the english people may be able to govern themselves they have exhaustively proved by the experiment of the last seven centuries that they were not able to govern any other nation applause so you see we have acted upon public opinion to indecipherable passage we are tired of proposing these solutions of the irish land question but still we can point to a great many valuable precedents which have been set up by the legislation of other countries and also to some extent by the legislation of england what we ask is that the tenant farmers of ireland may be allowed to own the land they till and we are willing to give to the landlords the full extent of their vested interests in the lands we do not wish to rob them of anything but at the same time i cannot help expressing my opinion that if these reforms are continually resisted if all our concessions are refused the time will come when the reasonable propositions we make will no longer be by the irish landlords applause now the shout of communism is of course raised because we ask that the tenants may own the land they till and we are told that we are land robbers and that we must not interfere with the rights of property now i wish to say to that that one of the first principles of british law is that no man can have absolute proprietorship in land the law student learns this amongst his first lessons and it is a principle which has been sanctioned by blackstone and all the great leaders of english jurisprudence personal property and real estate differ in that respect that no man can have absolute property in real estate while he can in personal property the great english historian james anthony froude who cannot be accused of prejudice in dealing with this irish question in the last number of the north american review or the number before the last bears very remarkable testimony to the soundness of what we say on this point he says that land strictly speaking cannot be the property of any man it belongs to all the human race laws have to be made to protect the tiller of the soil and to ensure that he obtains his proper share of returns for his exertions but to be the private property of this or that man to do with it as he please land never is and never ought to be applause now the different governments of the world have at all time recognised that land must be handed over in trust to certain persons upon certain conditions in the united states of america some of the land has been handed over by the state the land having originally belonged to the state it is sometimes handed over to great railroad companies more of it has been handed over to occupiers who occupy it under the homestead laws of that country the railroad companies who obtain these lands do not obtain them as absolute property they only obtain them conditional upon building a road through the country and throwing the land open for settlement i allude to this to show you that the land originally belongs to the whole people the government of the country transfers it upon certain conditions to certain persons who have to fulfil these conditions in order to obtain possession in the same way the landlords under the old feudal system obtained possession of the lands in ireland but the conditions have been universally violated and i state that which has been corroborated by the historian froude when i say that in consequence of these unfulfilled conditions the land might be justly forfeited by the landlords to morrow applause but we do not desire to do this we wish to give the landlords full compensation for these lands this has been done in prussia where the king stepped in and transferred the land from the landlords to the tenants he compensated the landlords by issuing government bonds bearing four per cent interest and he ordained that the tenants should repay the government by paying five per cent interest per annum on the amount of these bonds for forty five years at the end of that time further payment ceased principal and interest having been discharged that was the way in which it was done in prussia the legislature of england has also established a precedent of a similar character under the bright clauses of the land act of the government were empowered to advance money to tenants desirous of purchasing their holdings from landlords willing to sell and the money was to be repaid by the tenants to the state by annual instalments of per cent spread over a period of thirty five years both principal and interest being repaid by these instalments the parliament of england clearly showed by these clauses that they recognized it as a desirable thing that tenants in ireland should be encouraged to own their farms but it stopped short at compulsory expropriation it was willing to advance money to the tenants of landlords who wished to sell but it did not sanction the principle that the landlords should be forcibly expropriated mr bright the other day in speaking upon this point said he believed that after a while if the bright clauses were amended in a certain direction which he indicated the landlords would find it to their interest to sell and that a large majority of them would sell well i am very much inclined to think so too i think that if the present land agitation in ireland goes on for a year or two longer the majority of irish landlords will find it very much to their interest to sell cheers and laughter but still we think it hard that the parliament of england should throw upon the unfortunate starving tenants of ireland the duty of doing that by an agitation which they themselves ought to do by law cheers an objection has been made to this transfer of the land from the landlords to the tenants and we have been asked if the tenants are not able to pay their present rents how is it to be expected that they will be able to pay an annual instalment of principal and interest to the government to this i reply that the examples which we have had of sales of land to tenants under these bright clauses all show that the tenant feels such a security when he is an owner that he will improve his holding to an extent which he never ventured upon before and that he will strain every nerve to meet the annual instalments he feels in fact that he is dragging a lessening chain behind him instead of a lengthening one cheers and that every payment he makes is so much to the good in fact it has been found in practice that the tenants pay long before the thirty five years have expired many of them pay in five six eight or ten years they exceed the instalments required of them they double and treble and quadruple them in order that they may free the land from the government charge all the sooner the london times the other day published a leader in which it took up this line of argument viz that if the tenants could not pay their rents they could not be expected to pay the instalments to the government if the land were sold them now it happens that when the property held by the english church in ireland was sold the rights of pre emption was given to the occupying tenants and the state was permitted to help them in the way i have explained five thousand tenants of the church purchased property holdings and the times made the assertion that these tenants had failed this year in paying their instalments lord monck whom you know of in this country the head of the church temporalities commission in ireland at once wrote a letter to the times of which the following is the substance the irish peasant proprietors appear to be a thrifty set of people notwithstanding the traditional idea to the contrary it is officially stated that out of an annual payment of due to the church commissioners on moneys advanced by them to about five thousand proprietors in ireland under the church dis establishment act the arrears due this winter are only or less than six per cent of the amount of interest due this too in the face of the fact that there have been three successive bad harvests cheers now how is this on one hand you see the tenantry of ireland engaged in a life and death struggle against their landlords to obtain an abatement of their rents large numbers of them perishing of starvation and on the other hand you see the once tenants of the irish church commissioners now proprietors able to pay within six per cent of the annual charge on their lands it is the magic of property which turns sand into gold that has produced this extraordinary state of affairs and we think of sic the experiment were tried further that the same magnificent result would appear throughout the length and breadth of ireland and that we should never again have another famine there cheers i wish before sitting down to say a word or two on the subject of the distress in ireland it is enough to break the heart of our people to have to content with such a terrible calamity as that which they are now contending with they were getting to feel independent to have a straight back and believe that they also had rights as well as the irish landlords when this frightful famine came upon them the distress in the west of ireland cannot be exaggerated i am told that in some parts of donegal a fortnight ago six hundred persons were living upon a penny a day or sixpence a week taking six persons to each family this pittance would be little less than a dollar a week for each family this state of things can scarcely be believed in this country it will scarcely be credited that next door to a rich relation like england the government of that country should have permitted this condition of affairs to come round applause i could scarcely have credited it myself and although we knew that there must be famine we hoped that it might not be so bad as it has turned out to be when we left ireland we estimated the number of persons who would probably be without food by the middle of february at about two hundred and fifty thousand but i regret to say that this number has now been very largely exceeded and that half a million or persons will be without food between this and next july now we had hoped that the distress might not have turned out so bad as it has but of course our information was not so perfect as that of the government the government has means of knowing the true state of affairs far superior to any we possess and though we were able to predict that two hundred and fifty thousand people by the middle of february would have to be fed the government up to that time had constantly denied that anybody was in danger of starvation cries of shame or that there would be any distress beyond that which the ordinary machinery of the poor law system could cope with under the poor law system ireland is divided for the purpose of the relief of the poor into a number of divisions called electoral divisions and the district which is distressed is taxed for the maintenance of the poor within it these divisions are very small and when one of them is overwhelmed with distress say to the extent of one half the population the burden of relief is thrown upon the other half with the result that they too are driven into the poor house well we had been warning the government all along that there must be famine this year so long ago as last june we told them so and what did the government do they did nothing in october the chiefs of the hierarchy waited upon the government and they disclosed what had come to their knowledge that there must be a famine the government took no notice of these gentlemen i believe they were not even asked to sit down and at any rate they were treated with very scant courtesy indeed another month passed away the distress evidently became more intense day by day and the government were at last moved to take some action and what was it they issued a circular to the poor law boards throughout ireland calling upon them to whitewash the workhouses and provide a supply of clean straw hisses and laughter and that was the only measure of relief undertaken by the government up to the time that we left ireland they have done nothing since the appropriation bill which has passed the commons has not yet i believe passed the lords it must be some time before it can receive the royal assent and before the cumbrous machinery bound up with red tape can come into action for the relief of the irish poor applause meanwhile the people of ireland have been left to the charity of every nation in the world except england now i regret to say it very much indeed but it is a truth that must be said that england has contributed far less according to her means infinitesimally less than almost any other country which has been appealed to hisses had it not been for the charity of the people of the united states of india of australia of canada of every country but england the people of ireland must have perished before now in famine by thousands and this appropriation if it had been made in june last when we urged it might have been of some use it could have been expended on reproductive works which would have improved the natural resources of ireland the interest would have been paid then then our people were not enfeebled by want and disease now they are too weak to work the long continued want which they have been suffering has made them so that they cannot handle a spade or pick and the consequence will be that this money which they might have received three or four months ago in the shape of honest daily wages must now be doled out to them as charity and our proud spirited people are degraded to the level of paupers it is enough to break the heart of a man who has been working in ireland and who has watched the noble spirit that was springing up amongst our people to see them degraded in this horrible and infamous way cheers i wish that i could think that they have not been brought to the gates of starvation purposely and desiredly hear hear and hisses i wish i could think that the government of england do not watch the approach of famine in the hope that by its help they might break down the spirit of the irish people hisses and cheers now in conclusion i wish to say a word in reference to a matter on which we have been criticized i refer to our action with regard to the various relief committees which have been formed in ireland for the purpose of assisting the suffering poor there and more especially to the mansion house and the duchess of marlborough committees now i approach this not very pleasant subject and it is least of all a pleasant subject to approach in a city whence you have sent a good deal of money to both these committees with some hesitation even still it is necessary to state the position we have assumed in reference to this matter we have thought that relief to the irish people should not go through the hands of the landlords that it was not in the nature of things to suppose that they could continue to struggle against this land system and yet have to apply for their daily bread to the very class who were oppressing them this is what we have done we have not accused the mansion house committee of mal administration by any means i do not believe it would willingly mal administer any moneys that were entrusted to it for purposes of relief but this we believe and this we are sure of that this committee is every large and landlord committee and that the sub committees throughout the country very largely partake of those also of course sub committees as they degenerate in the scale are not formed of the same lofty material as the mansion house committee they are not composed of attorney generals lawyers or other men of exalted positions but they are composed mainly and in great part of the agents of landlords their bailiffs and drivers hisses and we have feared that through them our people might be seriously handicapped in the struggle they are maintaining for their rights we have at least thought that in administering the relief you ought not to give political advantage to the landlord class and that our poor tenants were harassed enough without additional trouble being added we do not blame you when you have done everything fairly and with the best and most generous intentions i regret exceedingly that the subject is an unpleasant one to you cries of oh no now i have said that we don't accuse the mansion house committee of mal administration but i think it right to read you a number of resolutions passed at a meeting in ireland in order to show you that even if we had gone further our suppositions might have perhaps been well founded at a meeting of the land league relief committee held in louisburg county mayo ireland rev mr joyce parish priest in the chair the following resolution was proposed and unanimously carried resolved that having made three ineffectual appeals to the mansion house relief fund for aid to help us to relieve the present dire distress existing in this parish we solemnly declare that body as unworthy of the confidence reposed in them by the charitable public and we call upon the charitably disposed to withhold their subscriptions from a body of men who declare they will allow their fellow creatures to die of starvation unless their committee changes its name and we call upon the charitably disposed to send their subscriptions either to the irish bishops or to the national land league as being the surest and quickest medium of relief reaching the really distressed that the mansion house relief committee having refused to grant us any aid and to relieve the present distress we call upon our fellow christians and fellow countrymen at home to aid us with public contributions and that they will not allow their fellow creatures to die of starvation because of the name of the committee now i give this to you for as much as it is worth i do not wish to advance charges against the mansion house committee or anybody else which i cannot substantiate the position is that it is giving too much control to those in the landlord and government interest and now ladies and gentlemen in conclusion i thank you for the kindness and attention with which you have listened to my oration i feel great encouraged by the attitude of the people of canada so far as i have seen it displayed and i trust it will continue to show itself as it has to night if we succeed english landlords and english mis government in ireland will soon be a thing of the past prolonged

      "mr parnell said gentlemen of the irish national land league of the home rule league of the cork farmers club of the butt election committee of the queen college cork and also my friends from queenstown i thank you for giving me this practical proof that my enemies in this country have not yet succeeded in depriving me of my character here cries of no a voice they could not hear hear and applause mr parnell and when i say this i can assure you that it is very difficult to appreciate the extreme assertions which were made on both sides of the atlantic simultaneously to take away my character from amongst my countrymen both in ireland and in america hear hear this is the first proof which i have been able to receive that i have not forfeited your confidence here hear hear and i feel sure that i shall receive still many others in america i have already had i was going to say abundant proofs but overwhelming testimony would be perhaps nearer the expression of the utter failure of the pro british press of ireland and england to deprive me of my character with my countrymen in america but i may perhaps give you some idea of what the magnitude of these endeavours had been when i say that while on the other side of the atlantic a constant manufacture of lies was going on and being cabled across to ireland for the purpose of depriving me of the trust of the people of ireland so on this of the atlantic sic the manufacture of a similar nature was being undertaken and cabled over to america for the purpose of me of my character there now before i leave this rather unpleasant portion of the subject for it is not pleasant to have to being my fresh life in this country by criticism i wish to express my disappointment that at least one of those journals which assumes to itself the character of the representative of the national and liberal feeling in dublin a voice a groan for the freeman another voice a groan for the freeman whig groans mr parnell and at least one of these journals in the south of ireland which have taken up a similar position in this part of the country should have lent themselves to this base attempt on the part of the english newspaper press i thank the national land league for giving me this early evidence that they are still alive for they have been represented to us over in america as having departed this life fully six weeks ago a voice gray said so mr parnell i can assure them that just as they had no conception when we a few of us met together to undertake the formation of the national land league three months ago of the magnitude of the task in which they were about to engage so we have no notion of the enormous importance which this question has assumed in america and of the extent of the help which is being prepared in america for the irish land league to assist the tenant farmers of ireland in their task in obtaining for the tillers of the soil the right to own the soil applause i thank the cork farmers club for having been the first to welcome me back just as they were amongst the last to bid me adieu when i left the country and i congratulate them that they have so far been successful in warding off eviction from the tenant farmers of the county of cork and in keeping them outside the grip of the law applause to my old friends the butt election committee of limerick i would wish to say that i feel especially honoured that they have come to me here on my arrival in ireland it is but a repetition of their kindness to me when they invited me here on my arrival in ireland it is but a reception of their kindness to me when they invited me a few months ago to their historic city and when they gave me that welcome which limerick knows so well how to give to those who are honoured with their confidence applause and now i will conclude by saying that i feel most specially and highly honoured by the address which has been presented to me by young ireland applause in the shape of the students of the queen college of cork cheers those young men i am glad to see are emulating and almost leading the way for their countrymen in america of american birth and i am to see that while they in america of irish born parents are even more irish than the irish themselves in the true spirit of patriotism and devotion to the cause of the country of their forefathers so those in ireland whose parents have not been expatriated are when they know how turning the education which the government has given them for the purposes of destroying the nationality of ireland into an engine for the purpose of assisting ireland in regarding her lost rights applause gentlemen i am sure you will not expect me to speak at any length now there are many topics upon which i should like to touch but which i shall with your permission defer until this evening when in the city of cork i trust to have an opportunity of speaking in reference to the incidents of my visit to the united states of america and canada cheers\n",

      "mr chairman and gentlemen i thank you more than i can express to you for the exceedingly hearty and cordial manner in which you have received the toast of my health i am glad to be again in ireland applause i have seen since i last had the pleasure of seeing many of you much of the united states of america many of the lands and natural and artificial resources of that country i have heard as you doubtless have also heard much of the advantages of emigration as a remedy for all the evils under which unfortunately ireland labours but as i strolled up along by the river lee to day as i saw the beautiful meadows the beautiful green carpets the undulating hills and wooded valleys along that magnificent river i could not help thinking that it was worth starving for a little while in order to secure as a lasting heritage the land of such a beautiful island applause now gentlemen you have heard a great deal of the terrible failure that we have made in america and the unanimous verdict of american public opinion against us against the people of ireland and in favour of the irish landlord system and a great many other wonderful statements which have been drilled into your ears by the aid of the machinery which the press of this country and of england undoubtedly has as its command but i should like you before you come to a hasty conclusion to hear a little bit of the other side and i am sorry to say that you will hear the other side under every disadvantage because i have always been bad at blowing my own trumpet hear however i shall state some facts in elucidation of the motives which have induced many of the statements which you have heard picture to yourselves three insignificant individuals going through the united states of america mr dillon and myself and mr healy who joined us subsequently as we found that the work we had to do would take ten times as many as the two who went out first we were met at six o'clock in the morning at the steamer three miles from the dock by a reception committee composed of fifty of the most prominent citizens of new york city hear hear this bear in mind was at six or seven o'clock in the morning our reception committee this morning was not able to get up to come out to us until eight o'clock although it was composed of many good men men whom i could like to see by my side in any fight of any kind in which we might be engaged and using whatever weapons we might cheers well we were duly escorted to our hotel in new york and in two days after he addressed a meeting the receipts of which taken at the door over and above all expenses of our reception and stay in new york amounted to a sum of which money was remitted within a week after our landing and expended by the irish national land league to help the starving people of the west of ireland applause undeterred by this terrible failure in new york laughter we proceeded to philadelphia where we also addressed a meeting in the largest operahouse in the world i am skipping over one or two minor places newark jersey city and brooklyn where we addressed overflowing meetings and realised large receipts but at philadelphia where we addressed a meeting of which half had to go away from the doors owing to want of room no dead heads no oratory no music nothing in particular but the receipts in that one night amounted to dollars net that was sent with the same despatch and employed in the same manner by the irish national land league i am afraid i should get out of breath and you should get tired if i were to go on no no but i will say in short that during the two months of our stay in america and i must remind you it is only three months from this day since we left the shores of ireland we visited sixty two different cities that is a little more than one city a night we had to do two cities on one night we had sundays when we had to go to church so that we had several times to do more than one city a night between two of these cities we on one occasion travelled miles and during the two months we remained in america we travelled altogether something like ten or eleven thousand miles by land this joined to the six thousand miles of ocean there and back amounts roughly to sixteen thousand miles in three months which is not so bad for a man laughter the net results of these sixty two cities i am dealing now with pounds shillings and pence or rather dollars and cents we are not talking about sentiment nor honour and glory nor enthusiasm nor any of these matters which are above the moon we are speaking of these things which are under the moon the result of these sixty two cities excepting san francisco and one or two other places which we had not an opportunity of visiting was dollars actually in the hands of our committee in america or already remitted to the irish national land league dollars of this money is already in the hands of the irish national land league and the rest is either on its way or is already in the hands of our local committees through the different states of america i am not speaking now of what is to come i have no doubt if we had remained in the united states another month we should have sent back in that month dollars more applause the railway companies gave us full passes all over the states in fact i became so much accustomed not to pay that i was quite surprised when i was asked to day by an honest porter for 1s 4d laughter the municipalities of those cities met us at the railway stations and tendered us the freedom and hospitalities of their cities headed by their mayors cheers a voice where is the mayor of cork hisses mr parnell the regiments of the states through which we passed formed our guard and if it had not been for the differences of the uniform i was sometimes tempted to think from the precision of the drill and the clatter of bayonets and the magnificent accoutrements of those regiments that i was being escorted by the royal irish constabulary and in a different direction laughter in fact i could not help thinking of mr davitt triumphant progress between the lines of the royal irish constabulary last year from sligo jail to sligo courthouse laughter and finally the states legislatures wherever we passed through opened their doors to us and accorded us the privilege of the floor of the house and allowed mr dillon and myself to address them on the subject on which we had come to america applause and last the congress of america did what was unprecedented in its history loud cheers for the american congress which were continued for some time the entire audience rising the house of representatives of america held a special session on that occasion for the purpose of hearing us it had its speaker and official clerks and reporters in their places and you may see any of you who are curious enough to send for copies of their official records you may see my speech word for word in the official records of the house of representatives of america when they allowed me or rather invited me to speak on the subject of ireland cheers i said this was unprecedented kossuth some one will say was honoured in a similar manner but kossuth was not honoured in a similar manner kossuth addressed the house of representatives not in session no foreigner has ever addressed the house of representatives of america in session cheers upon this point i may say that all the other state legislatures adjourned their sessions for the purpose of hearing us whereas the house of representatives heard us in full session cheers now mr chairman and gentlemen you will say that this is a fine piece of brag on my part cries of no no i should never have thought of entering into those matters were it not for this system of unheard of misrepresentation misrepresentation which i could not have credited if i had not seen it and which the english press indulged in and which i am sorry to say has found a faithful imitation in some miserable servile irish journals a voice the freeman another voice and the cork examiner several voices down with them mr parnell i mention no names the verdict of history will decide the point which has been called in question here to night but i was going to say that i should not have alluded to this matter a voice you should have mr parnell were it not that the channels upon which an irishman ought to be able to depend for information in his own country have been denied hisses and i wish to say also that you must not suppose for a moment that i am so foolish as to imagine that any particle the most minute portion of what has occurred in america is in any sense due to the humble individuals who were in the position of representatives of ireland not as ireland ought to be represented but as best they could represent it the way in which we have been received in america is due to the fact that there is a greater ireland in america than even in this noble country cheers and that you have there growing up as your kinsmen in that country many young irishmen and irishwomen not men born in ireland it is true not inheritors of the sad inheritance which we who have been born in our own country must inherit but men who have been born in freedom applause who have had the advantage of the magnificent free school system of america who have studied the history of ireland and who understand that it is their first duty and the highest duty to do their utmost for the cause for their dear ireland even though they may never have seen ireland cheers until they shall have placed the country of their fathers and mothers in the same proud position that the country of their birth at present occupies now i wish to refer to some matters which perhaps i can speak about more fully and properly than others can during our visit to america i was informed on the highest ecclesiastical authority and it is well that you should understand the influence that has been brought to bear against the cause of ireland on that occasion and the efforts brought to bear against our efforts on that occasion i have been informed on the highest ecclesiastical authority that the government of england had attempted to influence the pope and the american bishops against our mission cries of oh hisses and groans i was informed of this on such authority that i cannot doubt it for a moment i cannot of course mention the names either publicly now or privately hereafter but in spite of this we were supported by some of the ablest american bishops cheers bishop spalding and bishop ireland who were full of sympathy for the poor panic stricken and starving emigrant when he ventures upon his new life in that western world they came upon our platforms they subscribed their money they endorsed the course and adopted the programme of the irish national land league nay more i verily believe that if their influence and greater efforts were wanting and if it were requisite for ireland sons to prove their devotion to the cause of ireland upon a different field than that which we are now called upon that one of these ecclesiastics at least would not be behind hand in giving his benediction to the new crusade for the freedom of the country from which they sprung loud and continued cheers the most rev dr lynch bishop of toronto who last summer spent a considerable time in this country and who is well acquainted with the condition of the tenant farmers of the country and who at that time strongly but vainly urged upon the responsible government of her majesty to do something which would have the effect of alleviating the distress and famine which desolated this land cheers he also is with us and the most extraordinary fact of all in toronto the orange city of canada where a catholic on certain days scarcely dares to show his nose and where o'donovan rossa had to fly for his life a voice cheers for o'donovan rossa mr parnell and whence we were warned fully a fortnight in advance on pain of a death which the red indians inflict on their victims this orange city received mr dillon mr healy and myself who actually walked in there a month ago without even a revolver in our pocket or a knuckleduster hidden away they received us with more cordiality and warmth than any place we addressed since this city of cork cheers and the leaders of the orange society in that city attended my meeting and paid their dollars for we did not speak for nothing in america and after the meeting they came to our platform and subscribed their money a voice orange and green will carry the day mr parnell when we arrived in america we felt it our duty for reasons which we have abundantly explained already and which i need not to go over again to warn the free people of america against choosing certain agencies for the distribution of their money and at the same time we ventured to point out the agencies which should be chosen as proper channels for relief and we felt ourselves bound to be rather exclusive in this matter and like most exclusive people i believe we have been fault with in this country however as we cannot expect to please everybody hear hear and a laugh in this country we may fairly congratulate ourselves in pleasing ourselves and the greatest number of our neighbours and i am happy to think that we have succeeded in pleasing the greatest number of our neighbours cheers we recommended as channels for distribution of relief from the united states the irish hierarchy and the clergy of all denominations cheering and the irish national land league cheers i am glad to say that our advice was followed almost to the letter during the two months we were there something like one million of dollars were collected for the purpose of irish relief in america of that amount two hundred thousand dollars as i have already said was collected for the irish national land league one of the distributing channels which we recommended and about as nearly as i can calculate for the irish hierarchy and clergy cheers so that altogether about a million of dollars was collected from the united states of america and i am now leaving out canada for the purpose of relieving distress in ireland cheers that i may add is only a drop to the sums that are ready to come if necessary cheers now i suppose i will be expected to say something about the present state of affairs in this country cheers issues are before the irish electors and at the present moment more momentous than any which have been witnessed by this generation i don't think that that is exaggerated talk you have the land question we know that the neglect of first principles in dealing with this question has caused the present famine that it has been productive of most of the misery that we witnessed in this our generation hear hear we have witnessed three famines brought about by the artificial system the feudal system of land tenure hear hear and how do you propose to win the right of the irish farmer to own the land that he tills well this is a very serious question and i do not wish to depend too much upon our members of parliament remember a great deal of it will depend upon yourselves and very much more will depend upon the choice which the constituencies of ireland will make at the approaching general election if they fail to avail themselves of the weapon which if properly wielded cannot fail of success combined with other exertions of an equally important character by the people themselves what can you expect can you expect sympathy and practical help in abundance simply because the world recognised that you were the under dog in the fight loud cheers but if you deliberately choose to remain the under dog no no can you expect anything better than that the outside world should have you to lie in the bed which you have chosen for yourselves cheers and cries of true we hear that a great many things have a variety of considerations we hear that such and such a man is a very amiable man and a most respectable man a laugh that he has a very large property and that he has given an abatement in his rent which is the most startling circumstance of all renewed laughter and that all these wonderful considerations entitle him to the confidence of a large and important constituency at a crisis such as the present what is going to happen to all the irish tenants who have not got such a wonderful landlord hear how can they suppose to find out the respectability to ancient lineage of this very estimable gentlemen and if you deliberately refuse your support to the men who at least shown that they desire to do something to help the country that as far as they can do anything they will do it you cannot expect those men to go on and work miracles for you know i do not wish to magnify the parliamentary policy too much i am very sensible that a parliamentary police at the outset can only be a portion of the whole but at the same time under present circumstances i think it is a very important portion hear hear now a year or two ago there was a dispute we are always disputing about something or other and i think that is a very happy state of things indeed indeed i don't know what we should do if we did not fight among ourselves occasionally and when our good friends tell us that the time is reached when the irish people will agree and be of the same mind that there shall be no difference of parties in this happy country and that there shall be no difference of opinion upon any question whatever i think what a happy country on this side of the grave hear hear i think it is rather too much to expect us irishmen to be what no other nation is to be of one mind upon everything so we were obliged to have our little differences very nearly a year or two ago on the question of a parliamentary policy but this is a question that has been lost sight of owing to a variety of circumstances and now it comes up again what do you want your members to do with the next parliament do you want them to sit on their hunkers to admire each other laughter and cries of no if you do you will choose the best looking men you can get cheers and laughter but we were recommending a policy to the country and when these great rival parties the liberals and the tories and the respectable section of the irish home rulers hisses and cries of whigs are disputing as to the rival merits of their respectable exertions during the last seven years i think it is only fair for us to put our best foot forward applause then as a matter of fact the only party which has achieved anything i do not mean to suggest that we have achieved anything i do not mean to suggest that we have achieved a great deal for we have achieved very little much less than we should have done if we had to do it over again the only party which has done anything at all during the last seven wasted years in parliament are the active part of the irish members loud and enthusiastic cheering the audience standing number altogether the insignificant yet mystic number of seven applause any advance that has been gained has been made by these men applause the lot of irish i will not say irish because the next prisoners may be be sic english or scotch the lot of political prisoners has been very much ameliorated and so has the law by which by which soldiers of the army of which one half is composed of irishmen suffer the terrible punishment of the lash and if we had only commenced it a year sooner we should have deprived the government of the inestimable privilege of packing the jury which convicted those poor men and women the other day at carraroe of an offence but which a free jury would have declared to be a proper and justifiable exercise of the rights of every citizen hear hear and we should have also prevented that same government from packing the jury which is to try messrs davitt brennan and others a voice a cheer for davitt loud cheers mr parnell then there is the irish seed potato bill which departs from the traditional custom of selecting the smallest for food and devoting the largest of them to seed and which gives the irish tenant an opportunity of seed for his land property a voice where is the mayor of cork cries of order mr parnell i wish my friend would leave the mayor of cork alone hear hear and laughter that also is due to the exertions of one of those same despised obstructive members my hon friend major nolan who has stood by us in many a hard fought field and who has followed me upon more than one occasion when i was in a miserable minority applause i pass over such small things as the intermediate act and the university act of last session which we could not make a good one and which we were obliged to accept for the want of a better for years mr chairman sic and gentlemen under the old system nothing was achieved you were going on living upon great expectations and we had not even the advantage of being able to apply to some stupid old jew for an advance upon our expectations cheers and laughter you will ask me what do you want the electors to do loud cries of hear hear i want them to return men of the stamp that will ensure success hear hear and there are plenty of such men but they must not be subjected to the humiliating ordeal to which some irish constituencies seemed determined to subject their future members if a man is to fight and work night and day for six or seven long years he is a man who should be known at sight and who should be judged by his actions in the past hear and if he judged by his actions in the past hear and he had not earned the right to a favourable judgement in this way there is no use in depending upon his promises for the future cheers i think it fair to my friend and myself and to the constituencies of the people of this country at home and abroad wherever they may be that a chance should be afforded upon this question and i have come back from america in order to do my utmost to give the constituencies of ireland an opportunity of showing what mettle is in them loud cheers sligo roscommon galway and the city of kilkenny new ross wicklow westmeath waterford leitrim king county carlow and cork cheers will be afforded an opportunity of testifying to the faith which is in them hear and then for my part i shall feel that i have done my duty there are powerful influences i observe upon taking a hasty glance over the political horizon which of course is rather obscure at the present moment and in the very limited space which has been available since my landing one of the results of the action taken by mr edmund dwyer gray hisses and confusion and cries of down with him and the freeman journal and counter cries of no has been to cause him to fly from tipperary loud cheers many of the assembly rising and cries of bravo tipperary two gentlemen then rose on the chairman left and in a very excited way called for cheers for mr gray and the freeman journal disorder prevailed for some months the chairman i think you should settle your private quarrels outside this room and not disturb mr parnell mr parnell there is no disturbance whatever there is no desire to interfere with anything i have to say i am not surprised at this action on mr gray part well knowing as i do the feelings of the premier county of ireland cheers and some hisses chairman i have to request again that you will keep silence this is not at all fair mr parnell in his contest for the county of carlow i wish mr gray sincerely every success as the lord mayor of dublin will at least be an advance upon messrs bruen and kavanagh laughter as for his colleagues in that county i know nothing and can say nothing mr biggar m p no nor anybody else mr parnell i don't know anything of him except that i have heard that he is a scotchman a voice oh that enough laughter mr parnell and so far as i know that is the sum of the knowledge of everybody else in reference to this gentlemen except what he may have given in his election address or in speeches to the constituency if he has yet made any now mr chairman and gentlemen i regret if i have detained you at too great a length no no i believe that there are issues of unequalled importance knit for our country at the present moment and it will be for us to show that we are at this side equal to the emergency i believe the irish constituencies limited though they may be that the majority of them will show that they are as good as we can expect them and that they will do that which is right that they will uphold the great trust which has been committed to them a voice how many do it mr parnell and so far as each of us can go we can only work our best for that object we have now in hand the task of crushing the system of irish landlordism and when i say irish landlordism i say it advisedly it is a system which though apparently similar in other countries has not been equalled in any country in infamy and the destruction of innocent people are you afraid to join in the work no let those who are afraid take themselves off cheers other nations have crushed far better systems america has crushed a feudal system canada has crushed it prussia and france have crushed it and why should not ireland cheers are you going to wait for another famine to those who want to wait i say it were a pity that they were rescued from this one hear hear the majority of the irish people will i hope go as they always have with better lights and better powers to the work on which their heart is fixed i believe that not many years possibly elapse before we see this one last remaining prop to english misgovernment in ireland broken in pieces and sent to join its fellow a late established church and if we succeed as i have frequently told some of my american audience in emigrating the irish landlords english misgovernment will soon have to follow them

      "mr parnell said he did propose to make a statement but it was more in connection with matters concerning the land league at a meeting of which body it was his intention to speak there were however some practical matters that might very well be disposed of now for instance the case of mallow hear hear the position up to the present was this mr william lane o'neill had offered his services in the home rule and national interest to that borough and he believed there was also a whig barrister who had come forward in the same place mr o'neill had been drawn down in mallow for some days and he found that the situation there was a very close one and that the result of a contest between him and mr johnson might perhaps be doubtful though he thought he could win it and in conversation over the matter with mr o'neill who had exhibited throughout this matter a most patriotic and self sacrificing spirit as he always had done during his life he told him mr parnell that he wished to take whatever action might be considered most desirable by his friends hear hear with a view of securing that that seat may not be lost to the national party now mr o'neill had been prosecuting his canvass there for some days and he had assured him mr parnell that if the name of any other gentleman were adopted by this league as being more likely to win the seat than himself he would waive his own previous undoubted claim now there was a little difference of opinion in the borough with regard to mr o'neill candidature and he mr parnell thought they could secure a more united front amongst the different sections of the national party by the adoption of mr george delany applause who had agreed after considerable pressure to offer himself provided such a course was satisfactory to mr o'neill with whose chances he did not wish in any way to interfere he might also add that mr o'neill had most generously guaranteed to give his full and entire support to mr delany he had received from mr shaw a letter saying that he too felt certain that all sections in mallow would join in supporting mr delany and with mr shaw valuable support he was sure there would be no risk of their losing the seat he would therefore propose that having taken into consideration the question of the mallow election the home rule league learns with satisfaction the patriotic determination of mr wm lane o'neill to waive his undoubted claim on the electors and we thank that gentlemen for the sacrifices he has made the chairman said he had just been informed by mr donnelly that mr dick had threatened to evict any of his tenants who went to the poll mr parnell any threat of that kind renders the person making the threat liable to six months imprisonment with hard labour mr parnell as to wicklow within the past three or four years the registry has got into a bad state but there is a clear majority of at least or he moved that having heard it is the intention of mr mccann to offer himself to the electors of wicklow we call on them to use their best exertions to secure his return\n",

      "mr parnell said mr chairman and gentlemen in view of the very great anxiety which exists through the country to ascertain the chances of the different constituencies of either retaining the services of good members or of winning seats from the whig or conservative candidates it has been suggested to me that a short statement might not be undesirable and uninteresting and also that there is considerable anxiety to learn how things have been progressing since my return from america of course the time for action is necessarily very limited although lord beaconsfield was kind enough to give us perhaps more than the usual margin but still in consequence of my absence in america the time for any action i might be able to take is considerably circumscribed but i may say that as far as i have seen the prospects are exceedingly favourable hear hear for a considerable diminution of the conservative forces from ireland and also for a strengthening of the home rule party both in numbers and quality hear hear since my arrival in ireland i have visited and addressed the constituencies of cork city kildare county tipperary county athlone and roscommon county in cork when we arrived first they were somewhat uncertain as to whether they would run the risk of putting forward a second home rule candidate they feared they could not carry the second seat and that the result might be the gain of the seat by the conservatives now as this fear seems to have deterred cork for a number of years it seems to me that it would be almost better for cork to break the chain that seems to hold the energies of the city even at the risk of seating a conservative for if they are to go on as they are going on now always tolerating a whig because they fear the return of a conservative the influence of cork will continue to be neutralised as far as the national question is concerned whereas if they once made up their mind to strike a bold blow i feel convinced that they would return their two men and even if they lost one seat the conservatives i am sure that once the effort had been made in the right direction and once the whig were got rid of the tory would be got rid of at the next opportunity i am glad to hear that by the accounts which i have just received they intend to contest the second seat hear hear there are two names i believe before the constituency those of mr riordan jun nephew of the president of the cork farmers club and captain croker and i have no doubt that a suitable selection will be made by the constituency itself coming next to the county kildare which i visited on the monday following my arrival in this country i found a feeling very widespread that mr harris was not perhaps a sufficiently strong enough man to defeat a gentleman of such extensive local influence as mr m o'ferrall and that if he persisted in his candidature the result would be an almost certain loss of one of the seats in that county and i ventured to press upon mr harris that it would be patriotic for him to retire in favour of a strong man if such a person could be found before the next county meeting at athy to take place on monday for the purpose of finally selecting a candidate for the second seat mr finigan at the same time was very much pressed to offer himself as a candidate for this city and to leave ennis but he has up to the present moment declined to do so however i have been informed that to day a very influentially signed requisition is being proceeded with in the county of kildare for the purpose of inducing him to reconsider his decision and i trust that before the county meeting on monday he may be induced to offer himself as a representative for the county kildare in the borough of athlone i am glad to say that mr shiel prospects seem very favourable hear hear the case of roscommon county is very peculiar the o'conor don has represented that county without a contest for years and it is therefore very difficult to estimate by reference to past experience the possibility or probability of returning a national or home rule candidate for that constituency and impressed by these considerations and the desire of at least one or two of the prominent men in that county that the o'conor don should not be disturbed and recognising his past services in some respects mr egan not to the farmers mr parnell not to the farmers but to other questions i ventured in the interests of peace to suggest some three months ago that if a satisfactory national candidate were adopted the o'conor don might be tolerated for a while longer however i found upon my visit there yesterday that the feeling against the o'conor don had increased to such an intense pitch that it would be perfectly useless for me to renew the made a few months ago hear hear in fact i should not have been listened to for a single moment if i had ventured to talk about tolerating the o'conor don and i therefore very reluctantly felt myself obliged to express approval of a resolution unanimously adopted at a very influential meeting of electors in the courthouse in roscommon yesterday declaring that neither the o'conor don nor the hon charles french merited the confidence of the county and they have now adopted dr cummins and major darcy and i have very little doubt that both of these gentlemen will be returned by a very large majority hear hear the feeling against the o'conor don is most remarkable they seem to think that the sins of mr french are comparatively small as compared to his for they think very many of the shortcomings of mr french would have been spared if it had not been for the example set him by his older and more knowledgeable colleague laughter on the whole taking a review of all the constituencies i may say that we are doing right and well a number of gentlemen will undoubtedly be returned who will work for ireland as she has never been worked for before hear hear nothing is more difficult owing to the want of local preparation which somehow of other always seems to be one of our failings at the time of any great crisis and from the short time allowed for constituencies than to make suitable arrangements in over places i may mention that my friend mr shaw and i have been in constant and cordial communication since my arrival from america hear hear and i feel sure that the result of the present elections will be the return of the best set of representatives who have ever entered the house of commons from ireland perhaps it would not be out of place if i were to go over the list of constituencies where suitable selections have been already made and it will be seen that ireland is not at all in the unprepared condition that some of the government or whig section may imagine i am not referring to the north of ireland which i suppose we must leave to the tender mercies of the whigs and tories with the exception of my friend mr fay and mr biggar county where i believe they will beat both whig and tory i have no doubt that the orangemen in the north of ireland will after a time follow the example of their american and canadian brethren and become good irishmen united at all events on the land platform hear hear in athlone as you are aware mr edward shiel has been adopted by the priests and people as their future representative he is opposed by sir john ennis whom i trust he will be easily able to beat in clare the o'gorman mahon stands again and it is not quite decided whether lord francis conyngham will accompany him this time as a colleague to the house of commons or not ennis my friend mr lysaght finigan is again offering himself and i regret to say he is opposed by mr william o'brien who undeterred by his past failures seems determined once more to become the means of producing confusion and dissension in that borough in wexford mr john barry and mr garrett byrne descended from a celebrated wexford family have been selected by the leaders of public opinion to contest the county in the queen county messrs lalor and o'connor have been almost unanimously selected by the priests and people in westmeath i am glad to say that messrs gill and sullivan are likely to have a walk over applause and to take their places in the house of commons unopposed in new ross mr j w foley seems to have taken the hearts of the electors and people by storm in mallow mr george delany has just commenced his canvass which i trust will be a most successful one in leitrim messrs nelson and o'beirne are before the constituency and i hope they will be both as successful as they undoubtedly deserve to be hear hear in roscommon as i have just said there are messrs cummins and d'arcy in galway borough mr t p o'connor a most distinguished young irishman author of life of lord beaconsfield a work of the greatest possible talent and merit and who is one of the most distinguished journalists and literary men amongst the rising young men in london has offered himself to the constituency wicklow is a county which has always been neutralised between the tories and the nationalists but we trust although the registry is not in as good condition as it has been yet we feel very confident we can carry both seats messrs corbett and mccoan are now before the county and i feel sure they will be unanimously chosen by the priests and the people at a county meeting to be shortly held hear hear in the county tipperary which i visited the other day my friend mr john dillon applause was unanimously chosen with mr p j smyth by one of the most if not the most influential meeting of representative men throughout the county which i have ever attended in mayo mr o'connor power is as yet the only selection and i hope that they will be able to select a suitable second candidate before very long in dungarvan mr f h o'donnell applause has again offered himself but it would be superfluous for me to say that i am sure he will meet with no real opposition now over constituencies have asked me to advise with them in reference to the choice of their candidates and perhaps i may say that this has placed me in an awkward or rather an unparalleled position by some proposals that have been made to me several constituencies besides have honoured me by representing that my own name is the only one for their particular place and requirements i wish particularly to refer to the county sligo where at a highly representative meeting of the prominent men throughout the county the clergy and laity i was honoured by being chosen to contest the county with mr denis o'conor i suppose this was done in order to prevent the return of mr king harman apparently it is supposed that no one else exists except myself as a foeman worthy of mr king harman steel but i cannot join the meeting in sligo in supposing that king harman is so very difficult to beat as they think in fact i think my energies can be very much better applied than in unseating king harman and that it will be perfectly easy for at least different gentlemen who are available for the purpose to defeat the conservative candidate king harman i think it would be a very poor compliment to the patriotism of a county like sligo to suppose that no one else but myself can undertake this job and if i stand for any other county except meath i shall stand as a forlorn hope and try to win some county where the work will be very difficult and a much more uphill fight than sligo i was asked in the event of not standing myself to suggest a gentleman for the second seat and i ventured to name my friend mr healy who has been my companion in america and to whose services in that country i have been exceedingly indebted for very much of the success i may have attained there hear hear i may add that mr healy name has been identified with the national cause for a great many years and that whenever he has been tried he has not been found wanting as a young man he would be one of the most promising recruits to the parliamentary phalanx and speaking for myself he would be an enormous assistance to myself in much of the hard work which i have had to undertake almost singlehanded up to the present time and i trust he may be unanimously adopted at the adjourned meeting which is to be held in the county sligo for the purpose of finally deciding on a second candidate the people of sligo need have no fear that mr king harman will be allowed any longer to misrepresent and insult every national feeling and aspiration if we can prevent it hear hear as i said before i cannot allow my name to be put in contest for any other county except meath i cannot find time to sit down and besiege a constituency but if in any other place which is difficult to carry they would honour me by selecting me as a candidate and absolve me from the necessity of attending very much in the county personally i should be very happy to contest such a place to the best of my ability hear hear as i think that all of us should do something to diminish the conservative or whig majority in the approaching parliament i would ask the home rule league to be of good courage affairs never looked more promising than they do now and i believe the result of the elections will be first to diminish materially lord beaconsfield majority in the house of commons and secondly to give renewed help and hope to the national cause and the cause of the tenant farmers of ireland applause\n",

      "mr parnell who was enthusiastically cheered said a resolution had been proposed for their acceptance that they endorsed the candidature of mr leahy for this county cheers mr leahy was a tenant farmer he had pledged himself to the great question of national self government for ireland he had pledged himself to adopt the programme of the national land league of ireland hear hear and he had also promised to assist the active party in the house of commons in compelling the attention of the english government to the claims of this country he mr parnell had always thought that there were too few tenant farmers in the irish representation and that the constituencies of this country were entitled to a much more numerous representation of tenant farmers than they had at present hear hear it was however unfortunately exceedingly rare to find a tenant farmer with sufficient means to enable him to go over to london this was because that parliament was in london instead of in dublin hear hear the class from which they could select their candidates under the circumstances of parliamentary representation in london was an exceedingly limited one and they were therefore usually precluded from taking advantage of the services of many men intimately acquainted with the wants and necessities of the tenant farmer class and particularly well fitted to be the exponents of that class hear hear it was fortunate therefore that on this occasion they had found in mr leahy a man so well fitted and so well able to do battle for the cause of ireland cheers he congratulated the county of kildare upon the opportunity which was afforded to them of being represented in the house of commons by such a man as mr leahy cheers now the tenant right question was the question at the present day of the most vital importance to this country they saw that at the present moment the tenant farmers of the west of ireland were dying of starvation owing to the rack rents groans the tenant farmers of kildare were not yet in a state of starvation a voice they are very near it but they were very hardly pressed indeed and knew not how soon it might come upon them if they were compelled to pay the rack rents which were crushing the industries of ireland to the ground if they continued to have to carry the millstone of the feudal system of land tenure around their necks they knew not how soon they the tenant farmers of kildare might not be just as badly off as those in mayo connemara and donegal cheers the instinct of self preservation therefore must teach them that the land question was a question as he had said of the most pressing importance and that it was necessary for them to devote all their energies and to call upon their members to devote all their energies to the solution of this question cheers he was glad as he had said before that a gentleman had offered them his services so well fitted from his position and knowledge and acquaintance with the necessities of the tenant farmers to represent them in the house of commons but they must not shut their eyes to the gravity of the present contest the county kildare was contested by a very strong man who represented the landlord interest down with the landlords and cheers mr more o'ferrall it would take great and strenuous exertions to enable the county kildare to defeat this man and kildare must not go to the battle in a divided and disunited state unfortunately there were two national and tenant right candidates before the constituency besides mr meldon who had been already adopted cheers he would appeal then to his friend mr harris when he found the voice of this meeting was in favour of mr leahy to show his patriotism and his love for ireland by retiring from the contest cries of he must in this way he would show his love for ireland and enable the county to fight a strong battle against the enemy cheers he would only say in conclusion that he believed kildare would do its duty and chase both whigs and tories out of the county cheers\n",

      "electors and non electors of meath i feel that i owe you some apology for not having appeared here sooner cries of no but i have always felt in my communications with the county of meath a sort of confidence that i believe no other member representing any constituency in ireland can possibly feel and i know that meath would believe that i was not slighting her cries of no and if i have come here late it is because i feel that the constituency of meath can be safely entrusted with the task of maintaining the national honour of ireland cheers and cries of bravo that you require no help to keep you in the straight path the reputation of meath is not of to day she has proved herself now and in many a hard fought fight and one of the greatest consolations i have always had during my political life is the knowledge that i represent a county like meath which could calmly and coolly weigh every act every utterance of mine and not hurriedly judge of me cheers you are now called upon to choose representatives for the county when i came among you six years ago unknown in the political world you honoured me on that occasion with the greatest trust that could be confided to any man it is the proudest boast of my life that i believe that you have the same trust and confidence in me to day that you had six years ago cheers i ask you now to renew that trust and confidence cries of we will to allow me to represent you in that parliament which for good or for evil will have more to do with the destinies of ireland than any parliament that has ever sat in the british house of commons the priests of meath have unanimously adopted me cheers and have decided to recommend me to the people of meath for adoption and election and they have moreover said that not one penny of the cost of this election shall be borne be sic me they have also decided upon recommending as my colleague a gentleman who is well known to you mr metge a man of great sincerity and conviction cheers and who i believe would rather die at the stake than surrender his own opinions and principles cheers he is a young man like myself and in casting in his lot with me i think he goes into a good school hear hear and cheers and i have the greatest confidence that the people of meath will endorse the choice of the colleague and that the priest and people in meath will be united as they have been previously upon many a hard fought battlefield cheers this was probably the greatest opportunity that ireland has had in the constitutional political line and i believe that a really united party in ireland will have enormous power over the future destinies of this country it is of the greatest importance then that you should have a man to represent you at this time who will not yield to any consideration except what they deem in their own hearts to be for the good of their country and if you return such men believe me that the sacrifices you have been making will be requited to you the people of ireland may be in a suffering and struggling condition but believe me they are very powerful they have their own future in their own hands cheers see then that you are equal to the occasion and that you allow no selfish feelings of fear of landlords or bailiffs or agents to deter you from doing your duty at the poll if you are afraid of doing your duty you cannot expect your members to do it hear hear a sort of a man named burke has come forward hisses and groans a voice another groan for harry burke mr parnell i do not know whether his candidature is a sincere one or not but whether it is or no it is our duty to treat it as a serious one and to use ever sic exertion to defeat him the tenant farmers of ireland ought fully understand on this occasion their interests will be the first interests considered in the new parliament and if you are represented by men that are sold in advance to the government you must expect to be sold yourselves let not this chance slip by and let every one of you resolve as far as you can those of you that have votes to go to the poll and fight for the man of your choice those of you who have not votes go to encourage your friends that have them a voice a groan for the beggars of enniscorthy groans mr parnell i do not wish that enniscorthy should get a bad name or wexford either shouts of down with them the county of wexford is a noble and gallant county enniscorthy is a patriotic town and the doings of last sunday were the doings of neither the people of wexford or enniscorthy it has been reported that i was struck with an egg i believe but there is no truth whatever in the statement i was not struck the whole time a single blow either with fist stick or egg and i think it is a remarkable testimony to the patriotism of the patriotism of the people of wexford that not a single man could be hired to strike me loud cheers and cries of if we had hold of him a voice three groans for the sham patriot o'clery mr parnell and although five or six hundred men were undoubtedly hired as a mob to disturb the meeting and i was in the midst of them and at their mercy for two hours not one of them struck me cheers and now

meath like gallant tipperary like rebel cork cheers like roscommon like my own native wicklow and like the county of carlow of expressing her opinion at the polls and of deciding whether she shall be represented by true and honest men or not the county of mayo has been foremost in the struggle against landlordism cheers it was in mayo the fight was inaugurated in may a fight which has resounded throughout the length and breadth of the whole world a fight which has created an echo in the hearts of your countrymen in australia and america wherever the tongue of england is spoken wherever an irishman lives there they feel for your sufferings there they are determined to do all they can to help you in your trials cheers it was fit and proper then that mayo which has initiated the struggle and borne her part so nobly in it all along that mayo should have an opportunity of saying what her opinion is as to this question are you willing that the infamous system which has hung like a millstone around your necks during these long years which has produced famine even at the present moment among your people which fetters the industry of the whole country which caused your sons to present themselves as beggars in all parts of the world are you willing that this infamous system should be patched up and in a new dress continue to exist cries of never a voice it is you we may thank for the relief another voice only for you we'd starve mr parnell or on the contrary are you determined that you will join hands with all the other irish constituencies and say that landlordism

with all your heart with all your might and with all your soul every man of you cries of so we will and every woman who has a husband let her work with all her might and soul to send her husband to the poll cheers now a letter has appeared within the last few days from a most respected loved and venerated prelate of your church a man whose name should be pronounced with love by every irishman i refer to dr mccormack cheers a voice three cheers for dr mccormack cheers mr parnell yes three cheers for him cheers he has said unkind things of me he has written words which i feel sure when he understands the real situation and the real object with which we entered into this contest i feel sure he will regret hear hear throughout the length and breadth of america wherever my friend john dillon the member for tipperary cheers and myself went we advised the relief committees to send their contributions to dr mccormack and dr conway we selected these two bishops out from all the rest firstly because we knew that they were true hearted and honest above all others and secondly because we knew they were in the midst of the most famished districts in ireland and i am sorry i regret it from the bottom of my heart that i should have seen the day when dr mccormack and i appear to be on opposite sides i say appear to be because we are not really cheers we are both really on the same side and when this little misunderstanding has been brushed aside as the thing of little moment that it is you will see that no one will come forward with more joy and happiness than dr mccormack to congratulate the people of mayo on placing myself and o'connor power at the head of the poll cheers now fellow countrymen i have not come here with any personal object i have come because there was a great principle at stake because i believed that principle required vindication at your hands and because i believed that you are better able to vindicate it than any other irish constituency i have placed myself in your hands cries of you are safe and cheers you know my past history you know that i have not spared myself by day or by night by land or by sea in your service cheers i can only promise that if you honour me by returning me as your representative i will continue to devote myself to your cause in the past until the irish tenant farmer is free from the grinding tyranny of his

      "mr parnell delivered an address from his car in which he stated that at the present crisis in the history of ireland it was important that the opinion of the constituencies in reference to the great questions of the day should be fully ascertained it was with that view his friend mr kettle had come forward for the representation of the county their late member colonel colthurst had not shown that their belief in their cause which was required at the present moment in the coming parliament the representatives of ireland would have unexampled opportunities of gaining beneficial measures for ireland and what they sought was that those opportunities should not be lost owing to the lukewarmness apathy and want of belief in their cause of those who represented them colonel colthurst announced that he would stand by them but they should recollect that it was only when he wanted a seat in parliament he declared himself in favour of the irish farmers during the last two sessions he had shown that he was unable to rise superior to the prejudices of his class cheers he had shown by every step he had taken that he could not educate himself up to the position which an irish member ought to take at the present time they wanted men of energy determination and independence to fling themselves into the gap to really work for the people otherwise they would lose the magnificent chance of settling the land question on the broad and deep lines which providence had now afforded them it had been said by the gentlemen who introduced him to that meeting that they ought to pay a personal compliment to him mr parnell he wanted no personal compliments the best personal compliments they could pay him was to be true to themselves to recollect that they had a great cause in their keeping and that the tenant farmers of cork were now afforded an opportunity which they never had before of showing that they could join hands with royal meath gallant tipperary rebel cork roscommon sligo wicklow carlow county wexford and with all the other noble irish constituencies who were now doing their duty to the cause of ireland cheers he asked them then to be true to themselves and to return a man from amongst them a j kettle at the head of the poll\n",

      "the chairman mr parnell said his attention had been called to the article in the express italics and to articles in some of the english papers as to the appropriation of the league funds he was not sufficient of a lawyer to express an opinion whether the articles were libellous or not but he certainly thought if this offence against journalism if this gratuitous accusation against the administration of the charity fund of the league was again made by any newspaper that it would be desirable to take counsel opinion upon the matter the land league relief fund was the only fund that did not charge any expense of administering relief against the fund itself he was told that the mansion house committee had a large staff of clerks constantly engaged and that there was no fund except the relief fund against which to charge the expenses of all these officials he was also informed in the case of the marlborough fund that large charges for travelling expenses had been made by one of the gentlemen travelling the country on behalf of that fund he thought it should be known that the league relief fund was the only fund administered in ireland without one penny of expense against the relief fund all the expenses had been defrayed out of the organisation fund he should also mention that from advices just received from america he believed they should not anticipate that very many more remittances for relief would reach ireland every parish in the union of the united states had now subscribed and he might add that the land league had only received a very small proportion of the contributions from america possibly not more than one fifth had been sent from america to ireland to the relief committee and in addition he believed had privately reached the hands of the catholic hierarchy for relief purposes in all hear hear that sum would show that america had contributed quite as fully in proportion as australia hear hear in view of the cessation of contributions from america he would recommend the league to restrict their grants to a certain extent in order that they might have funds in hands during june and july these would be trying months hear hear the chairman said he thought too much importance had been attached to the enniscorthy incident every public man was likely to fall into an ambush of that kind particularly when he trusted himself to the people as he was always in the habit of doing hear hear it was somewhat remarkable that this enniscorthy incident was the only one of the kind in the elections an attempt a determined attempt made by a hireling mob to inflict personal violence and injury but as he had said the incident was one to which every public man was liable and the county of wexford had given to it the reply that was expected from her hear hear with reference to the land reform programme which the committee had been appointed to draw up he felt assured from the conversations that had taken place that there was every chance of their drawing up a programme that would be accepted by the country at large and which would be suited to the whole of the country he believed too that every honest politician in ireland would agree in carrying out that programme and that it would be accept by the sound portion that is the majority of the english liberal party it was therefore with very great doubt and some misgiving that he had seen some passages which taken in connection with the announcement of the meeting of the irish members or some of the irish members to be held two days before the land league conference would give rise to an impression in some quarters that a disposition existed to form a separate party on the land question outside the irish party and practically speaking outside the great bulk of the country the passages to which he referred were these but union may be purchased at too great a sacrifice there is no object there is no reason whatever in tying together people who are separated by party or by policy in fact they do the questions they have at heart more injury than service if they are bound together by a mere mechanical tie and then lower down he says if we are not then we must work separately now he the chairman would remind the gentlemen present that during the five years he had been in the house of commons he and his friends had been unfortunately in a very significant minority yet in everything they had done they were always mindful of the obligation that rested upon them of keeping together of holding together the irish party hear hear of being bound by the majority of the irish party no one could point to any resolution of that party of which they formed such an insignificant minority during these five years which they did not scrupulously observe and respect it would have been of vital importance to that minority on many occasions if they had been allowed freedom of action it would have been of vital importance to the future of the cause they had at heart but they always felt themselves under such an obligation to preserve the union of the irish party that on one hundred occasions they allowed themselves to be cribbed cabined and confined rather than do anything to break up or disrupt the party it would they felt be a miserable thing if at that time when the prospect of gaining reforms for ireland was opened any section of the irish party finding that the great majority of the opinion of the country had not maintained the former majority of the party but believed in the former minority it would he repeated be a miserable thing if in such circumstances any section of the irish party undertook the responsibility of breaking up that party and destroying the chance the country now had of achieving great advantage hear hear\n",

      "mr parnell m p who was warmly received moved the first resolution that we recommend as an ad interim italics measure in view of the desperate condition of the country until comprehensive reforms can be perfected that a bill should be pushed toward with all speed suspending for two years ejectments for non payment of rent and for overholding in the case of all holdings valued at a year and under and suspending for a similar period of two years in the case of any holding whatsoever the right of recovering a higher rent than the poor law valuation however they might differ as to the best method of obtaining a final settlement of the land question every one would admit that it would be impossible to obtain this final solution in the two months that yet remained of the present session of parliament and that consequently one of the most practical things to which they could devote their attention to day would be the devising of some measure by which they could prevent the great distress and social disturbance which must result if something was not done to check the unbounded power which the law gave to the landlord over the tenant at the present moment applause the resolution dealt with two classes of tenants in the case of those valued at and under it proposed that the right of ejectment for non payment of rent should be suspended for two years and as regarded tenants over a year it proposed that no higher rent than the ordnance valuation should be recoverable during a similar period of two years there were in ireland about holdings valued under a year and of these were valued under a year it happened that it was just this class of tenant that mr gladstone bill offered the greatest inducement to the landlord to get rid of and to cease the present crisis in agricultural matters for the purpose of getting rid of under mr gladstone act tenants valued at and under if disturbed by the act of the landlord were entitled to seven years rent as compensation mr parnell said the land league did not desire in assembling the gentlemen composing this conference to tie them down to their programme it was their duty to prepare a programme it had now been before the country for several days and they trusted and hoped that one of the results would be that a very full discussion would take place the land act provided that if tenants valued at under a year if disturbed by the act of a landlord might be awarded seven years rent in lieu of compensation in addition to sums for permanent improvements but if such a tenant were evicted for non payment of rent he lost all claim to this compensation for disturbance and was only entitled to whatever the chairman might award him for permanent improvements it was just this class of tenants who were most stricken to the ground by the present calamity many of them were in a state of starvation and unable to pay any rent at all hear hear and if the landlord was left in full possession of the rights which the act of gave him and if he proceeded to exact these rights the result would be in the west of ireland during this coming autumn and winter scenes which they all must shudder to look forward to therefore he thought that one of the first duties of the land reformers should be to place the legislature in possession of the circumstances affecting these small tenants and to suggest a method whereby the time might be obtained for a solution of this question and the frightful evils which they anticipated would follow he himself thought that no land act could reach the case no permanent land act could reach the case of the majority who were crowded upon small holdings which in the best of times they could scarcely earn a livelihood and pay the rent as a matter of fact they had not paid the rent out of their holdings but by working as labourers the second part of the resolution dealt more particularly with tenants valued at a higher rate than it suspended for a period of two years the right of recovering a higher rent than the poor law valuation now he thought that everybody would agree that the poor law valuation could not be paid under the present circumstances in fact many landlords had already throughout the country reduced their rents to this valuation and he was sure they would not be accused of asking anything very exorbitant when they asked that until parliament has had time to investigate this very difficult land question this class of tenants who had a large property many of them invested in their holdings should be protected from those landlords who desired to run counter to all dictates of common sense by desiring to exact a higher rent than the poor law valuation mr parnell said they were drifting into a discussion as to the relative merits of peasant proprietary and a measure for fixity of tenure and fair rents and he would appeal to the o'donoghue to consider whether it would not be convenient for him and for the conference to raise the question he desired to raise on the second resolution mr parnell m p who was received with applause said perhaps it would be as well for him to put before the meeting precisely and exactly what his resolution as it originally stood proposed to do it proposed to suspend ejectment in the case of tenants valued at and under for a period of two years and it proposed to make the higher rent than the tenement valuation irrecoverable in the case of all holdings whether under or over valuation hear hear he did not want the meeting to suppose that the original resolution proposed to do nothing for the large farmers it proposed to do a great deal for them and in his humble judgment he thought sufficient for a temporary kind it proposed to reduce their rents to the poor law or tenant valuation a voice too much applause mr parnell describing what appeared to him to be the effect of the amendment proposed by mr fisher and also mr muhallum marum said mr fisher proposed that the right of ejecting a tenant for non payment of rent should be suspended altogether for two years no matter what the valuation of the tenant was if his amendment were adopted the tenants of all holdings in ireland would be free from the liability of ejectment and they would have to pay the ordnance valuation they could be proceeded against for the rent and if the meeting accepted this amendment they would certainly revive the old practice of distraint because the landlords in such cases would resort to distraint instead of to ejectment mr mulhallum marum proposition amounts to this that ejectment shall be abolished in the case of all tenants and that no adjustment of the rents whatever shall take place that the rents shall be left as they are and the only relief to be given to the tenants will be to deprive the landlords of the power of eviction he did not think this would protect a large class of tenants it would in his opinion protect the small class of tenants but it would not protect the large hear hear his reason for dividing the tenants into classes was that they had been already divided practically and legislatively they were therefore in different classes and their divisions and circumstances were entirely different he thought they had to divide the tenantry into two classes in the first place because the land act of mr gladstone had divided them into two classes before the meeting decided upon abolishing the difference between the two classes he would ask them to consider as to whether the requirements of the majority of the larger tenants would not be met by reducing the rents of those about say to the poor law valuation and whether a measure brought forward in that spirit would not have a very much better chance of passing than a more radical measure which so many gentlemen described hear hear he did not wish to put the meeting to the trouble of dividing but he did affirm most positively his feeling that they would be making a mistake if they did not introduce limitation as regards the right of ejectment when they protected them by reducing the rent to the poor law valuation there was no necessity for protecting them by a further reduction of the right of ejectment hear hear and applause mr parnell amended the resolution by inserting a year as the amount of valuation instead of mr parnell none gentlemen i think we shall agree with each other that the debate we have had upon this important question has been a highly instructive one for my part i should be very glad if i could go with the o'donoghue and his friends in clinging to this attempt to prop up the old feudal system of tenure in the shape of fixity of tenure at fair rents i can assure you it was only after a long struggle after serious thought and consideration that it was my duty to join those who have given up once and for all this attempt cheers for recollect however you may disguise your meaning any compromise with the system of landlordism simply means the prolongation of that system applause we are told by the advocates of fixity of tenure we want to get fixity of tenure while you are getting a peasant proprietary now i would ask these gentlemen how long have they been fiddling with this question cheers for how many years for a quarter of a century i think cries of more and has not this question of irish land tenure made more progress within the twelve months than it ever made before applause the hon member for tralee says that the objections which have been found with the late mr butt bill can be got over he puts these objections on one side as if they were of no importance but does not tell us how he is going to get over them he has not laid either now or at any time any scheme or bill before the public by which the fatal objections to mr butt bill can be got rid of applause mr marum speaks of the ancient system of copyright as an elucidation of the mystery but i certainly think before we say that mr butt was not the best and most perfect attempt to reconcile the system of partnership between landlord and tenant in the land before we come to that conclusion we ought to see some tangible scheme from other gentlemen which purports to be better mr marum we did draught one mr parnell and i believe mr butt bill was adopted in preference hear hear at all events mr butt measure is the only tangible measure the country has before it professing to cope with the undoubted difficulties that have always beset land reformers in their attempt to reconcile the conflicting interests of landlord and tenant in the land it comes to this are the tenant farmers of ireland going to make a stand for the land or are they not applause and cries of yes if they are going to make a stand they will send their representatives before parliament and they will instruct their representatives to say that they will not accept as a final settlement of the question any lesser right than the right of owning the land of ireland loud cheering we may fail we may fail next session at least our task will not be a harder one than when we were at first instructing the tenant farmers throughout the country to use determination and courage in maintaining their rights to the land of this country when they had to force not a liberal government but the most bigoted conservative government that ever held the reins of power in england now that we have more favourable prospects now that we have a government which at least is pledged to a certain portion of our programme why should we get faint just as the goal almost is in sight cheers why for want of a little courage and belief in our own cause should we stop short at the last moment we have been told that we must protect the tenant farmers from being rackrented we do propose to protect them by the means which has been adopted by this conference already and i say that there is in part of these proposals a far better method of protest for the tenant farmers against rackrenting than that contained in mr butt bill even supposing it was possible to carry it out applause the department would be empowered to acquire the ownership of any estate upon tendering to the a sum equal to years purchase of the poor law valuation and to let the land estate to the tenants at a rent equal to 3½ per cent of the purchase money a grant of money would be given to the commission with power to purchase estates where there were rackrenting landlords and with the power to take away from such landlords the rights they have abused there is nothing revolutionary in that and you at once afford perfect protection to the rackrented tenant applause that would be pending the final solution of the question the gradual conversion of the present tenants into owners therefore i have felt myself unable to go with the o'donoghue in clinging to this ancient vestige and i shall be obliged to vote against it if he persists in taking a division cheers mr parnell the commission would as a matter of course have power to carry out what mr o'sullivan wishes to have carried out mr parnell in putting the vote of thanks said mr ferguson had fulfilled the duties of chairman with a fairness firmness and tact that he never saw excelled hear hear he deeply regretted that mr ferguson did not find it convenient to offer himself to a constituency at the late elections for the country could ill spare the services of such a man he hoped the time was not distant when mr ferguson would see it was his duty to do what he had not done in times gone by he asked them to pass the resolution by acclamation loud applause\n",

      "fellow countrymen it is for the first time with very mixed feelings that i address an audience in the county meath during the last five years since first you took me by the hand and placed me in a position of public trust and confidence i have always felt in every act of my public life that i had my constituents and the people of this county cordially taking me by the hand and helping me with their sympathy and practical aid to the best of their endeavour applause but on the present occasion i am obliged to announce to you a step which is most distasteful to many of you my friends in the past and i hope in the future hear hear shortly after i appeared in navan the last time i was summoned to the city of cork to attempt to wrest that constituency from the grasp of whig and tory applause this was after i had pledged myself to your service and offered you my humble aid in the future parliament when i went to the city of cork i went to fight a forlorn hope in a constituency that had never before been won to shake the hold of the whig who had held it for long years and to eject the tory who had been returned for cork at the last general election hear hear i found the city of cork a prey to both whig and tory and represented by men of these two political creeds and i say that i did not dream that i could have won it at the short notice with only two days and nights to contest that great city cheers but i did believe that i could beat the whig and i told the people of cork that even if we did not succeed in beating the tory and returning me it would be sufficient if we prevented an additional whig from being sent to represent the already overcrowded ranks of that party in the house of commons well i went into the fight and in two days we won a victory which has since resounded throughout the length and breadth of the civilised world loud cheers we won the double victory and i was returned as member for the city of cork cheers now the circumstances in which i find myself are shortly these that if i carry out my own inclinations if i yield to the feelings of self interest which prompts me to remain as your representative the city of cork must undoubtedly be lost cheers what am i to do cries of hold it i have planted the banner of irish nationality in the city of cork hear hear with the waves of english misgovernment surrounding us upon every side and i believe that it is my duty to hold that banner and to hold cork cheers and hard as the fight may be i feel convinced that the victory that has been won in cork will spread throughout the south of ireland and that in a short while the counties of ulster which are now backward will join hands with connaught with leinster and with royal meath cheers with gallant tipperary and with noble mayo in taking line with the rest of ireland in this great struggle cheers i ask then your help and moral support to me in upholding this position i look to meath the pattern constituency of all ireland and i believe that meath will lay aside all local considerations and will add one more sacrifice to the many which you have already made for ireland by permitting me to sit for cork cheers i wish to leave the question of choosing my successor to the good sense and sterling patriotism of the electors priests and people of the county meath cries of sullivan i feel sure that meath cannot go wrong and that there will be no division in the national ranks hear hear and that you will choose a tried and trusted representative to take my place who will work alongside me and of whom you will not be ashamed as your future representative cheers for o'sullivan and cries of name him i wish to say a word or two to you about the all engrossing subject which is now occupying the attention of the people of ireland the question of land tenure twelve months ago in the county mayo a few of us commenced a fight which had for its object the abolition of landlordism in ireland at that time the prospects did not seem very bright terrible distress was threatened in the country great prostration seemed imminent and our people had little before them save the prospect of famine graves or forced emigration we went down to mayo and we preached the eternal truth the truth which one day or other will be recognised throughout the length and breadth of ireland england and scotland cheers that the land of a country the air of a country the water of a country belongs to no man that they were not made by any man and that they belong to all the human race we believe that fixity of tenure in the words of michael davitt means fixity of landlordism fixity of degradation and that if the people of ireland really desire to settle the land question that they must strike at the root of the evil the system of landlordism under which the land of ireland was first confiscated and robbed from its original holders cheers we believe that only on these broad and deep lines can a lasting settlement of the irish land question be maintained and that any attempt to patch up the system will only result in the further degradation and impoverishment of the irish people hear hear we have been told that our plans are impracticable that no parliament not even an irish parliament would agree to them we have been told of the hundreds of millions of money it would take to carry them out of the years of time it would take the arguments that have been used against us have been the arguments of lawyers and of pressmen men who get up a false argument and seek to build a substructure of absurdities on such a basis and i am entitled to say with tenfold more force aye with a hundredfold more force than our opponents can use that their method of settling the irish land question are a thousand times more impracticable impossible and unprecedented than the methods that we propose which have been ratified by the precedent set in almost every european country cheers the freeman journal italics a voice to h with it mr parnell thought if a commission were appointed to morrow with power to buy out compulsorily on twenty years purchase of the ordnance valuation all rackrenting landlords that every tenant in ireland would fly to the commission to be bought out well i am willing for the sake of argument to admit this though i don't admit it but if we admit that every tenant in ireland would apply to be under such circumstances must not the freeman journal italics admit on their side that supposing the legislature or any legislature could be found to pass into law the bill of the late mr butt must not i say the advocates of this bill also admit that every one of the six hundred thousand tenant farmers of ireland would apply at once to obtain a declaration of tenancy as contemplated by the bill hear hear i am now drawing a comparison between the practicability of the schemes and plans that have been proposed on different sides as i agree with the freeman journal italics that cool discussion on this question is of the utmost value and importance when the lines for a permanent settlement of the land question are undoubtedly about to be commenced by the imperial parliament well then if it is admitted that each of the six hundred thousand tenant farmers would apply to the county court judge for a declaration of title i want to know where the county court judges are to come from and how many years they are to live to in order to settle the cases which would be brought for litigation into their courts there are i believe or rather less than since the new county court act there are county court judges in ireland there are six hundred tenant farmers each of these in order to obtain anything whatever under mr butt bill is required to find an attorney we would want to find six hundred thousand attorneys in addition they are required to file their claims before these county court judges to collect evidence to employ surveyors to value the improvements which they have made on their farms to collect evidence with regard to these improvements and to do a great many other things which i have not the time to enumerate supposing that all this evidence could be collected these attorneys found and those claims filed in the county courts how many years would it take before the claims could be adjudicated upon by the first court not counting the other courts of appeal which the freeman journal says now may be disposed of allow one day at the most moderate estimate and in many cases it would take several days to go into the evidence and to prove the claims as to all the drains and all the improvements which the tenant or his predecessor in title had effected upon his farm allowing one day at a modest estimate for the time required to investigate each case before the county court how many days i was going to say for the county court judges sitting every day sundays and holidays and christmas day throughout the year how many days would it take for them to get through the job it would take county court judges something like fifty years laughter and cheers and at the end of the fifty years before it was half over for the bill requires a revaluation at the end of years the freeman journal italics to day says that it would have a revaluation at the end of seven years but long before the fifty years was half over as contemplated by the late mr butt bill the whole job would have to begin over again in fact we would require a new race of tenant farmers of attorneys and of county court judges to face the job and i for one am not prepared to hand the tenant farmers of ireland over from the grip of the landlords to the grip of the lawyers cheers let us settle this question on natural lines and not on artificial ones let us abolish the system and not seek to bolster it up i have said sufficient to show the absurdity of the proposition and in order to protect the memory of the late mr butt from the charge of framing such an absurdly impracticable bill i wish to point out that when he framed this bill the circumstances of the country were entirely different it was framed to meet an entirely different case or set of cases from these which now exist then the country enjoyed a sort of prosperity the prices were exceptionally high rents were rising and the object was not so much to make the landlords lower their rents as to prevent them from raising them to day the object we have in view is to make the landlords lower their rents and for that purpose any bill like mr butt must be entirely inadequate and insufficient hear hear now fellow countrymen i don't think that it is necessary for me to detain you at any great length but before i leave mr butt bill i want to say that the late mr butt in framing that bill publicly and privately repeatedly admitted that he thought the beauty of the bill was that it would never be brought into practice that the landlord with such a bill as that to prevent the landlord from raising his rent would not attempt to raise his rent but there is a wide distinction between trying to prevent the landlord from raising his rent and trying to make him reduce and it is just on this account that a measure framed by mr butt with some plausibility to meet the circumstances of three or four years ago must be entirely inadequate to meet the circumstances of to day cheers i have touched upon one point of this question and it is only one out of many that i could deal with in a similar way but i prefer rather than detain you by going into these technicalities i prefer to ask you to take your stand broadly upon the question of your rights start your plough on the right line and if you cannot drive it very far this year you will drive it a little further next year cheers but keep it on the straight line and if there are perhaps some few tenant farmers in ireland some few richer than their neighbours who might think that the adoption of such a measure as the one i have partially criticised might be of some pecuniary advantage to themselves i wish to remind them that they ought to look to the interests of the whole country rather than to the interests of a small section of the irish farmers and by showing a self sacrificing spirit and adopting the broad view that the land of a country ought to be for the advantage and good of the people of the country they will do what in them lies to assure the future prosperity and happiness of ireland and the breaking down of the last prop of english misgovernment in this country cheers parnell returned to the window and said he believed the county meath was able to judge for itself at the meeting to day a resolution was carried asking his friend mr a m sullivan to offer his valuable services to the county provided he felt himself at liberty to work harmoniously with him mr parnell in and out of the house of commons they knew mr a m sullivan and they knew his magnificent talent and great ability and they also knew that anything he promised he would do cheers the name of a m sullivan was known and honoured all over the world he had his faults like anyone else he mr parnell did not say that mr sullivan was perfect or on many occasions he and mr sullivan had not differed but he did think this that in the coming parliament when the work of construction as opposed to the work of obstruction the work of construction of good measures for ireland would have to be gone on with it would be a great loss to the whole country if the services of a m sullivan were not available and if he mr parnell ventured to advise them in a matter on which they were perfectly well able to judge themselves he would say if they chose mr sullivan and he offered himself to the county they would never have any cause to regret it cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who on coming forward was received with cheers he regretted he could not remain with them long as he had to go to kilkenny where he was informed almost every tenant was under notice of eviction and trusted that the people would excuse him for going away and would not allow the candidature of mr kelly to suffer by his absence but on the contrary urged them to further exertions he would be back with them again this evening at seven o'clock when he would address them again cheers now he understood that mr johnson while willing to present any merits of his own to the electors of mallow was endeavouring to take away his mr parnell character and had brought the freeman journal italics and the cork examiner italics to bear against him through a speech said to have been delivered by him some weeks ago as far as he mr parnell could understand it seemed that mr johnson contended that because the two papers contained the same report it must be true well it was the same man it seemed who sent the reports to the two papers hisses and if he sent a lie to one it was only natural that he would send a lie to the other he mr parnell had contradicted the statement the previous night a gentleman on the outskirts of the crowd here pressed forward and said he was responsible for the report mentioned by mr parnell and asserted that it was quite true that there were forty persons who heard mr parnell use the words mentioned in it mr parnell i tell that man who has interrupted me and who is the author of this false report that he is incapable of sending a true report to the freeman journal italics or any other journal he is not a reporter he is only a pretended one hisses and he has not the education to take down in shorthand my words or the words of any other man now we will proceed with the issue before the electors of mallow it is for you a plain one it is whether you will permit yourselves to be made the slaves of england it is a question of ireland against england i well know the power this man holds and i know that he is capable of going about holding out promise to this elector and to that but there is nothing before the constituency but welfare of the country mr parnell then went on to refer to the last section he said the circumstances attending the present election were altogether different no constituency in leinster munster or connaught would return a government officer and was mallow going to disgrace itself cries of no he mr parnell came down to cork on saturday and the polling was on monday just as the polling would be here and mallow had now as good an opportunity of doing her duty to the whole country as cork had a promise given to mr johnson when no one else was in the field a promise given under such circumstances had not the slightest validity and such promises became immoral when the electors had a man before them in whom they could place implicit confidence if a promise were given which the keeping of would cause to inflict great injuries on an innocent third party would a man be bound to keep it no a thousand times stronger then was their case when they considered the importance of the subject and the injury fulfilling a pledge to mr johnson would cause to thousands of their fellow countrymen it was their duty to vote for kelly and stamp johnson out of this borough mr johnson had complained that he had been stigmatised as a judge and said that he was not yet a judge neither was judge keogh when he went to athlone and threw ireland back twenty years and destroyed the independence of the irish party of lucas and duffy judge keogh was solicitor general as johnson was now and he did the mischief to ireland which johnson sought to repeat now surely then he was entitled to call on this borough to take the line with the rest of ireland to make some sacrifice and show that they were independent and that now when they had got an opportunity they would prove that the interests of ireland were safe in their keeping cheers\n",

      "mr parnell in reference to the communication which has just been read by the secretary perhaps it would be rather premature to discuss the question of what steps should be taken by the irish members in view of the distress which is just as pressing as ever on the country until we have heard what steps the government propose to take and i think if the conference agrees with me it would be better for us to postpone the discussion of the question to the meeting of the party in london to be held after we have heard the proposals of the government mr parnell i think if the lord mayor resolution were moved before we separate this evening mr parnell rose to move his resolutions on the land question and said my lord mayor i placed two resolutions on the notice paper last night in order to raise a discussion on the land question i think that nothing but good can come from a full and free interchange of opinions amongst the members of the irish party in reference to this very grave and important question and i am glad that we have been afforded such a good opportunity as the present one for the purpose of exchanging views with one another the land question has no doubt changed in its phases very considerably during the last twelve months up to that time the demands of the irish tenantry had been chiefly confined to the formula which is known as fixity of tenure fair rents and free sale and various propositions had been made from time to time by different men with a view of carrying out this formula practically carrying out this formula no very considerable difficulty had been found in claiming for the irish tenantry fixity of tenure and free sale and in providing machinery for the purpose of carrying out this principle but when the other branch of the subject came to be broached namely the machinery or means to be provided in order to arrive at a fair rent it at once became manifest that the chief and great difficulty connected with the whole subject was the providing of some machinery which would be just to both sides easily and inexpensively worked for the purpose of arriving at a fair rent the chief example that we have been afforded of a machinery for arriving at this end was the bill which was introduced by the late mr butt and which was several times brought forward in the house of commons and received the unanimous support of the irish party during the last session of parliament i may mention that a committee of which i was appointed a member a committee of the national land league considered this question and very carefully examined the provisions of mr butt bill and we were forced to the conclusion that mr butt bill did not provide a simple or efficacious machinery for the purpose of arriving at a fair rent and that it would be entirely inadequate to meet the necessities of the present situation and that committee expressed its views generally with regard to that bill in the following paragraph of its report we cannot then undertake the responsibility of recommending mr butt bill as a settlement of the land question nor can we conceive any permanent measure having for its object the adjustment of rents as between landlord and tenant which to the tyranny of the rent office would not add the uncertainty and peril of the law now i think that when a principle has been before the country for so many years as this principle of fixity of tenure at fair rents and free sale has been its prominent exponents should be prepared to bring some tangible measure before the country which will carry it out and i certainly think that before we are called on to sanction again the principle of fixity of tenure at fair rents we should be shown how some machinery can be provided for the purpose of arriving at what is a fair rent for recollect if you adopt the principle of partnership and that is the principle contained in mr butt bill you must be equally fair to both sides hear you must choose your arbitrators from both sides i have heard it suggested that a jury should be appointed for the purpose of deciding what a fair rent would be your jury must be chosen from both classes interested in this proposed partnership in the land you must just choose your jury equally from the landlords and from the tenants if you wish to be equally fair and impartial to both sides what then is more likely than that there should be an equal division on this question that the landlords should go on one side and the tenants on the other and that at the end of your proceedings you should find yourself no nearer to a settlement than you were at the commencement all this is entirely apart from the exceedingly great difficulty of detail which must be always connected with the attempt of the tenant to prove his property or share in the partnership because recollect that the bill of the late mr butt throws the onus of proof on the tenant in this respect he cannot claim a shilling worth of interest in this partnership until he has brought an action at law against his landlord and proved his claim to this interest by evidence some people have objected to the proposal of ownership by the occupiers that it would take a long time but i am bound to say that any method or scheme which has yet been proposed for arriving at a fair rent would appear to me to take a very much longer time for the perfecting of its details mr butt proposed an initial revaluation in order to enable the tenant to obtain this declaration of tenantcy sic we must assume that the whole of the irish tenants would apply for this declaration of tenancy and you would require at the outset an initial revaluation of the whole of ireland a valuation differing entirely from the valuation which was made by and under the superintendence of mr griffith now how long did mr griffith valuation take to prepare i think it was commenced in the year a member it was commenced in and finished in mr parnell i have been told that in some portions of the county of kerry it was only finished a few years ago a member that is not griffith valuation there are three existing valuations mr parnell well the valuation for ireland that we want is griffith valuation it took at least from ten to twenty years to carry that valuation out sir joseph mckenna fourteen years mr parnell and in the making of that valuation no investigation was necessary as to the improvements of the tenants but the very foundation of the valuation required by mr butt bill is that the improvements of the tenants should be investigated as well as the producing capability of the land so that you have two separate and distinct things to ascertain you have to ascertain first of all the producing capability of the land and secondly you have to ascertain the improvements of the tenant you have the task which took from ten to twenty years to carry out with the ordinary staff at the command of mr griffith at least doubled in difficulty and as a necessary consequence doubled as to the time that it would take in order to complete it now i think that leaving aside the great difference of principle which undoubtedly exists between the advocates of mr butt bill and those who advocate the abolition of the landlord system and its substitution by the ownership of the land by the occupiers if you ask me to admit for the sake of argument that the partnership principle in connection with the land is capable of definition and is a sound one the great difficulty connected with this system is the question of fixing what a fair rent is and until those who believe in the partnership principle as opposed to the principle of ownership show us how this fair rent can be arrived at in some easy cheap and expeditious fashion and some fashion fair to both sides i don't think that we should be called upon to admit that principle as a sound one recollect that you have had a great many years to mature your details we may assume that mr butt bill is the highest effort of practical genius in that direction but i have not seen that anybody has undertaken to answer the criticisms of the land league in reference to the details of that measure and until those criticisms are answered i think i may undoubtedly assume that it is not possible to answer them but my lord mayor undoubtedly there does exist in the country a very general feeling amongst the larger class of farmers that something should be done to enable them to claim immunity from eviction provided they pay what may be considered to be a fair rent and it appears to me that the only way in which one can do that for them in a cheap and expeditious manner is to take the only valuation we have and which has been given to us by the government and to claim that pending the permanent solution of this question on true lines that is on the line of abolishing the feudal system the tenant shall not be disturbed as long as he pays griffith valuation hear hear now the land league had been accused of asking for too much and that by reason of what we were likely to lose the present opportunity of obtaining a fair settlement of the land question for the tenant farmers of ireland but we cannot shut our eyes to the very great difficulties which beset this whole question of fixing a fair rent and i don't see how any cheap or expeditious method can be adopted save that of taking the valuation which the government themselves have given us the resolutions of the land league recently adopted in reference to this question and in reference to the question of suspending ejectments were these we therefore recommend as an ad interim italics measure in view of the desperate condition of the country until comprehensive reforms have been perfected that a bill should be pushed forward with all speed suspending for two years ejectments for nonpayment of rent and for overholding in the case of overholding valued at a year and under and suspending for a similar period of two years in the case of any holding whatsoever the right of recovering a higher rent than the poor law valuation the resolution which i wish to move as the second one i am dealing with them both together though putting them separately the resolution i wish to move as the second one is based on this resolution though they are different the second resolution is this that pending the consideration of the land question by the government and its satisfactory solution we recommend as a temporary measure that a bill should be introduced suspending ejectments in case of holdings valued at and under and limited the power of recovering rent for agricultural holdings to amounts not exceeding the government valuation i would bring in two bills for the purpose of carrying out that second resolution one bill dealing with suspending the power of ejectment for two years and a second bill dealing with the question of rent i don't think that the two questions can be satisfactorily dealt with in one measure i have prepared a draft of a bill dealing with the suspension of the power of ejectments the question of rent i have not yet dealt with in any draft of any measure but if this conference should adopt this second resolution i shall propose that the way in which the last portion should be carried out should be that it should be referred to a committee of that party to be appointed by the party to report and if approved of draft a bill on the question now the land league have been accused of extreme demands but you will see that the land league did not demand so much as i am now asking this conference to adopt they only demanded that the rent should be fixed at the poor law valuation for two years but i think that if we are to go into the solution of this question we ought to fix the rent until the question has been finally settled then i think that in the proposed bill we should also require a no disturbance clause except for non payment of rent we should have then if we should obtain enactments such as these we should have the smaller class of tenants men who are valued at a year and under who are undoubtedly the majority of them are unable to pay their rents at the present time we should have them protected from eviction for the space of two years the landlord having the same power of recovering this rent from them as the shopkeeper or banker has of recovering debts and in the case of all tenants we should have them free from liability for disturbance while they paid the ordinance valuation we should have then a simple and easy method of fixing the rent and in looking over this whole question i don't believe it is possible for you to adopt any other means of arriving at what a fair rent is now the ordnance valuator has been very much run down and my hon friend sir joseph neale mckenna has written a very instructive and interesting letter to the newspapers in reference to the subject in which he reminds us that the revaluation bill of the government introduced a couple of years ago was successfully obstructed by an amendment which he moved i don't wish to fall out with my hon friend as to the merits of obstruction on that occasion but i think that as a matter of fact my hon and gallant friend major nolan and myself were the first to put a notice of objection on the notice paper which we did on the very night of its introduction but my purpose for referring to the amendment of sir joseph neale mckenna was not so much to dispute the matter of obstruction as to point out that this amendment is based on an undoubted fallacy and that the ground upon which griffith valuation was made is not capable of being sustained i hold in my hand a book which has been out of print for a great many years it is dated and entitled instructions to the valuators and surveyors appointed under the 15th and 16th vic chap for the uniform valuation of lands and tenements in ireland you will recollect that sir joseph contention is that the valuation was on a fallacious basis because the cost of production was not taken into account in the valuation sir joseph mckenna that is not so it was not a fallacy because only the price of the articles produced was taken into account the cost of production alone would not do that i know the book you are about to quote from mr parnell well i understood your objection was this i have not your amendment here that the increased cost of producing the articles was not taken into account in fixing the valuation sir joseph mckenna i cannot read the exact words but what i said was that no valuation could be deemed satisfactory that was based on a schedule of the prices of produce unless the same valuation bill also introduced a schedule showing the cost of production and the other costs and circumstances attending the production of produce it was not that the price of produce alone was not an element that ought to be taken into account but that as it was it was utterly insufficient and that that principle had run through the books from down to mr parnell yes i am very much obliged to sir joseph mckenna for repeating his amendment i think i correctly described the effect of it now i find at page of this book instructions to valuators and surveyors the following instructions are given to the valuers and surveyers sic appointed under the act for the purpose of ascertaining the valuation section says the prices set forth in the 11th section of the act being the basis on which the relative and uniform valuation of all lands used for agricultural purposes must be founded it is incumbent on the valuator in determining the value of any farm tenement having ascertained by digging up the surface the quality and depth of the soil the nature of the sub soil to calculate the amount per acre of the annual outlay to which the tenant may be liable next he should calculate the average value of the produce according to the scale of the act and from these data deduce the net annual value of the tenement section provides in reference to arable land the valuation is to be according to the system of tillage pursued the amount of crop mixed at a given expense may be considerable or otherwise he also according to the suitability of a given crop to the soil and locality its cultivation may be expensive or the contrary clearly showing that the surveyors were to take into account the cost of production sir joseph mckenna so much the worse mr parnell by the 94th section of it is provided that in order to judge of the system of cultivation pursued it should be ascertained whether the rotation be such as will admit of the maintenance of stock sufficient to supply an adequate quantity of manure and whether the crops cultivated are suited to the quality of the soil thus lands in which oats or rye could be profitably grown under wheat may not repay the cost of culture then follow a number of tables showing the maximum quantity of tillage produce and the value on certain calculations of each statute acre showing that the cost of production and the value of the produce crops et c are all taken into account in fixing the valuation sir joseph mckenna certainly not under the act of parliament mr parnell excuse me then again at page i find most minute directions with respect to another objection which has been taken that pasturage land was not valued sufficiently but arable land was valued higher in proportion at that time than pasturage lands were now i find that is not so for there are most minute directions given for the purpose of valuing grazing lands i find it laid down that two sets of cattle can be finished in one season the land being preserved during the months of january february and march the weight of the cattle finished the prices that the meat fetches in the market and everything about beef and mutton is taken into account i cannot therefore see how anybody can support the contention that this valuation was not made with the utmost care and all the circumstances the cost of production the capability of production of land the value in the markets of produce both of arable and grazing land were all taken into account this then is the valuation on which i propose to act in fixing the rent it is the only valuation we have at the present time and i feel confident that with the exception of the feeding lands of ireland the farms are not able to pay a higher rent than that prescribed by griffith valuation i should be willing to agree to an amendment to the resolution with respect to the grazing lands grazing lands might be rented anew in many cases they are too low at griffith valuation and i think it would be very easy to provide for an exception in the case of grazing lands providing that they should pay a higher rent than griffith valuation but as regards agricultural holdings generally where a mixed system of agriculture is followed i feel satisfied that last year and this year and in all probability for many years to come it will be impossible for the occupiers of such holdings to pay a higher rent than griffith valuation now i may be accused of confiscation because i propose to reduce the rents to griffith valuation but whether you reduce the rents to griffith valuation by act of parliament or whether you reduce them by the cumbrous method provided by the late mr butt bill after many years of expensive litigation i fail to see that any charge of confiscation can lie against one method any more than against the other the situation with which you are face to face at the present moment is a very grave one if the landlords exercise their rights the rights the law gives them over the occupiers of these holdings in the coming winter there can be no doubt whatever that nine tenths of these holders will be at the mercy of decrees for possession hear hear i admit the question is a very difficult one and that we ought to approach it without heat and party bias of any kind but it seems to me so long as we take out stand upon griffith valuation we are on the safe ground that is the valuation which has been furnished to us by the government it is the only guide that we have and i defy any man to say in reference to holdings where mixed agriculture is carried on that they can possibly pay a higher rent than this griffith valuation hear hear perhaps my lord before i sit down i may be permitted to touch on the question in dispute between the two schools of thought upon this question i am one of those who believe that you will never be able to carry out the principle of partnership in land the landlord have been placed there under the feudal system of land tenure this system has perhaps worked well on the whole in england and england may be presented as the example of a country where the feudal system has been attended with less evil than in any other country i think ireland may be equally well represented as the example of a country where the feudal system has been attended with most mischief and suffering hear hear it is admitted on all hands that the system is a false one what hope then can we have in perpetuating such a system in ireland i believe the attempt to be perfectly hopeless and i believe that is one of the reasons why this question of land tenure has made so little progress it is because you have been proceeding on false lines because you have been talking about the mutual interests of landlord and tenant in the land when it is impossible that their interest should be a mutual one i have often talked with leading radicals men who are as advanced as anybody in this country on the question of land tenure i have talked with many of the members who supported the second reading of mr butt land bill in the house of commons and with the exception of mr courtney i never could find one of them who believed in it they said we voted for this bill because we admit that the land laws in ireland are in a miserable condition and that there is in fact need of some reform this is the only proposition you make we consider that you ought to be best acquainted with your own needs and necessities and with the way evils should be remedied and on the principle that the opinion of ireland ought to be respected in settling her own grievances we voted for this bill but we did not believe in it in considering the probability of a settlement i ask you are you prepared to go before the house of commons with a bill which only one single member of the house of commons so far as i have ever been able to ascertain believes in mr shaw you mean only one english member you don't mean to say that the irish members did not believe in it mr parnell i am sure that a great many of them did not laughter i except myself from that category i certainly believed at the time that the partnership system might be carried out but as we grow older we become wiser laughter while your highest vote for that measure among english members has been you never could get any leading statesman to come down and vote for it you never could get mr bright or mr gladstone or mr shaw lefevre or any of the men who have been identified with land reform in this country what hope have you then of obtaining the passage of such a measure as this and sic why are we to be told that because we expose its followers and ask you to go on true lines in the settlement of this question why are we to be told that we are losing the chance of a settlement hear hear now there is another and a greater reason why i think that land reformers ought to strike at the root of the land evil and that is the system of landlordism i speak now from the national point of view in the highest sense of the word there can be no doubt that one of the reasons and the greatest reason next to the religious question which now i hope no longer exists hear hear the greatest reason why the upper classes and many of the middle classes in ireland i speak more especially of the protestant body to which i belong myself have remained aloof from the national operations of ireland and have refused to give them assistance has been this institution of landlordism hear hear you cannot expect the landlords of ireland to strike for the rights of ireland as long as you supply them with every inducement for the maintenance of the english system of government here by upholiding this land system hear hear it is not in human nature to expect it well then i ask you will you proceed to ask the legislature to enact a bill which in order to give a tenant a first claim to his right makes it necessary for him to go to law against his landlord which provides for a periodical reiteration of this litigation and which provides moreover no other solution of this land question we have been charged the land league has been charged with setting class against class i take it that no surer way of perpetuating the system which england has introduced and supported in this country the system of setting class against class could be devised than the proposition which has been made by the late mr butt in the land bill which he brought before the house of commons i for one believe that we shall never obtain the national rights of this country until we unite all classes in support of these rights and i refuse to have any part to placing one of those classes at the disadvantage of remaining in permanent opposition to the wishes and aspirations of the irish people as they must be placed in if you continue the irish land system hear hear i have to move my lord that we cannot accept on behalf of the people of ireland as a final or satisfactory settlement of the land question any measure that fails to secure the ownership of the soil in the occupier mr parnell i think the foundation of our existence as a party depends upon the independence of the members composing our party of all english combinations hear hear and i think that the declarations which we renewed yesterday declarations which were drawn by the late isaac butt fully expressed that opinion i don't see how it is possible for mr villiers stuart in face of his letter to the london times and to the bishop dr power bishop of waterford i don't see how it is possible for mr villiers stuart to subscribe all these declarations or to be considered a member of our independent irish parliamentary party he has expressed in that letter very clearly that instead of being independent of all english liberal parties and dependent on the home rule party he considers himself independent of the home rule party and dependent on the english liberal party he calls himself an independent member of the home rule party whatever that may be and i don't see how we can possibly admit mr stuart however desirous we might be of enlarging our numbers i don't see how it is possible in view of the declaration he has made to admit him as a member of our party otherwise any of the liberals who have been returned for irish constituencies could claim to come into any particular meeting which they might fancy to attend or any particular question that they desired to influence discussion about and to select themselves as mr villiers stuart has evidently selected for himself on this occasion and then remain away from our other deliberations entirely on other questions and from our whole party organisation without stultifying ourselves therefore i cannot see that mr villiers stuart can be a member of our party i regret very much that this incident should have arisen and i think it would have been much better if mr stuart under all the circumstances of the case and having regard to his recent correspondence had not presented himself here hear hear but now that the painful duty has been thrust upon us i don't see how we can evade it and therefore i support mr biggar proposition that we proceed with the discussion of the land question if this can be put in any less offensive way i should be glad mr parnell did we not adopt a resolution which was passed at the home rule conference of a subsequent resolution which refers to taking counsel together these are the resolutions of there was a subsequent resolution which was also adopted mr parnell said he thought mr stuart had broken one pledge to his constituency clearly and plainly according to the intimation given by dr power he had broken one pledge to his constituency and he thought if they adopted that resolution they would simply give him an opportunity of breaking another hear hear mr parnell asked if his lordship would have any objection to include a resolution carried unanimously by the party in and which he thought they endorsed yesterday sir joseph neale mckenna would probably have that resolution it certainly ought to form a part of the charter of the party so far as he recollected the terms of the resolution were that on all questions affecting the interests of ireland and upon imperial questions of importance the party shall meet together and consult he thought his lordship had only read the resolutions carried in this subsequent resolution was in his opinion of equal importance and it was adopted after the experience of the working of the party for several years and he did not see how it was that it had been excluded he must mention that it was proposed by his hon friend mr shaw and unanimously adopted by a meeting of irish members subsequently at a conference held in the rotundo he observed that the only allusion made to united action in the resolution of the conference meeting of referred to the home rule conference mr parnell i understood it formed part of the constitution the lord mayor believe me you will find these enough for him laughter mr parnell i beg to propose that we re affirm that resolution the lord mayor don't you think these resolutions will be enough for mr stuart hear hear mr parnell i think my lord we should have them all together if we are going to adopt it and we can adopt it now mr parnell in order to bring the matter to an issue i would suggest that the alternative propositions the lord mayor has drawn up be put to the meeting hear hear mr parnell a very small bit of it mr parnell hear hear mr parnell which machinery mr parnell what would you do mr parnell i beg mr shaw pardon but do i understand him to mean that he would only give perpetuity on estates which were purchased or would he give the commission power to investigate the circumstances on other estates that were not purchased and to give the tenants perpetuity mr parnell was it an attempt on the part of the landlord to raise their rents and not an attempt on the part of the tenants to get a reduction mr parnell next winter mr parnell i beg the honourable gentleman pardon so far from wishing to fix rents permanently i merely wished to fix them until the land question could be permanently settled on the basis of the ownership of the occupier mr parnell hear hear mr parnell i voted for mr butt bill four times the lord mayor in your speech you seemed to say did so only under certain restrictions mr parnell not at all the lord mayor in the report of the committee of the land league you say there is no merit in fixity of tenure except the attractiveness of its name therefore i am justified in saying you are not quite clear in your support of the principle mr parnell it was on the defects of the plans then before us mr parnell one word of explanation the only sense in which the land league ever objected to the term fixity of tenure was in this sense in so far as it implies that fixity of tenure is to be the final solution of the land question and that the fixity of tenure which has been proposed up to the present time the details of it have been found to be entirely unworkable for my part and i believe i may speak for those who have been working with me in the land league we desire to the fullest extent to secure the tenant full immunity and freedom from disturbance pending the final settlement of this question and since i gave notice of my second resolution last night i have altered the resolution in that sense hear hear mr parnell in taking the chair said in the absence of the lord mayor i believe it will be my duty to take the chair mr parnell and further because all the proposals which have been hitherto brought before us for the purpose of carrying out this scheme of fixity of tenure at fair rents have not been of a practical nature mr parnell i endeavoured to show that the valuation was high enough mr parnell seven mr parnell then proposed the second resolution as follows that pending the consideration of the land question by the government and its satisfactory solution we recommend as a temporary measure that a bill should be introduced suspending ejectments for two years in the case of holdings valued not over and limiting the power of recovering the rent of agricultural holdings to amounts not exceeding the present government valuation and protecting the tenant from disturbance as long as he pays such rent this resolution was in two portions it dealt with two distinct question and he thought if the resolution was adopted they could only carry it out by introducing two separate and distinct bills originally it was proposed by the land conference that the duration of the first part of the resolution should be limited to two years the first part of the resolution now contained a proviso that the duration should last until the land question had been settled in the final manner indicated by the resolution which they had just passed a long while ago he ventured to point out the defect of mr butt land bill and he invited those gentlemen there were in favour of that bill as a final solution of the land question to show how rents should be fixed in a very simple easy and inexpensive way and he was sorry to say that none of the speakers who had followed and who had supported the principle of fixing rents by arbitration or otherwise had shown how this could be done and that had been always the great difficulty apart from the question of principle which he felt when dealing with this question hear hear he was in hopes that mr shaw would have thrown some light upon this matter of fixing rents but he simply went over ground which had been travelled to no purposes he assured the conference that it was only after the very strongest and gravest doubts that he consented to go against mr butt bill at all even as an ad interim italics measure having replied to the objections advanced by mr shaw mr synan and mr marum the hon gentleman continued mr shaw said something ought to be done for the labourers now the condition of the irish labourers and that something ought to be done for the labourers now the condition of the irish labourers is one of the strongest arguments for ownership of land until we have land owned by a number of small farmers we never shall have the land broken up and until rendered easy to sell it will be impossible for the labourers to acquire possession of land hear hear one of the most horrible effects of the present system of land tenure in the hopeless condition of the labourer hear hear they have no incentive to exertion the only exertion that they require to use is how to do as little as possible for the largest day pay they can get and it has come to this that the employers struggle on the other hand is how to get as much as possible for the smallest day pay that is the condition of the agricultural labourer it is the condition also of at least of the irish tenant farmers who are living on small holdings throughout the country until the land of the country can be brought into the market and put into the hands of a number of small owners we never can settle the irish land question my friend major nolan asks would i make a peasant proprietor of a man of acres certainly i would make him the owner to morrow because before many years his acres would be broken up and would come into the hands of the small farmers who are unable to obtain land at present it is the system of landlordism that produces these anomalies it is landlordism that has swept the people off the fertile lands of the three provinces and driven them to the poor lands to the bogs and to the hill sides until you end that system you will never be able to bring the people back again you must end it but you won't be able to do it merely by such a land bill as that proposed by mr butt when mr shaw lefevre introduced his commission bill the late mr butt said the proposition only touched the fringe of the land question mr biggar and i happened to be in the house and we ventured to say that it went to the very heart of the land question i believe those who watch the course of events more and more every day will understand that the present land system must be put an end to and that it is only by the mode we point out that the safety the security and the future welfare and prosperity of the country can be obtained i beg my lord mayor to move the resolution i read at the beginning mr parnell mr butt made two propositions one that the rents should be settled by a jury of farmers the other by arbitration mr parnell said he had no objection to divide the resolution into two portions as suggested by mr o'shaughnessy and further if the conference desired it he would propose to refer the second part of the resolution to a committee to consider the question of rent hear hear but he thought a bill might be introduced on the opening day of the session of parliament which would admit of a settlement of that question that bill of course would have to be introduced on the first day otherwise they should get no day at all for it he thought the committee which might be appointed might arrange the title of the bill in the usual way as regarded the first portion of the subject he had drafted a bill which he thought would meet all the necessities of the case it was called the ejectment suspension ireland bill mr parnell having read the clauses of his bill concluded by moving the first portion of his resolution mr parnell thousands and thousands of tenants in ireland are two years in arrears they cannot possibly pay their rents they have been paying them in the past going to england and earning it as harvetsmen and that source of employment having been cut off they have fallen into hopeless arrears within the last few years all i propose is that there shall be a temporary suspension of the power of the landlords in order to give time for the consideration of this question mr parnell i propose now my lord that a committee be appointed to draft a bill to carry out the provisions of the foregoing resolution and to devise means for affording the tenantry and ad interim italics protection for excessive rents pending the final solution of the land question mr parnell i said the tendency of the system was such mr parnell who would your lordship suggest mr parnell i have very much pleasure in putting the resolution of thanks to the lord mayor for the kindness and ability and impartiality with which he has presided over our deliberations we are all much indebted to the lord mayor and the corporation of dublin for affording us the use of their splendid chamber i think it is a happy augury that this is the first time in which the irish party has conducted its deliberations in public in presence of the press and i think it is to be congratulated on the results applause\n",

      "mr parnell in proposing the adoption of the bill drafted by the committee said the committee had been appointed to carry out two resolutions adopted at the late meeting in dublin to the following effect i that pending the consideration of the land question by the government and its satisfactory settlement we recommend as a temporary measure that a bill be introduced suspending ejectments for two years in cases of holdings not over that a committee be appointed to draught a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution and to devise means for affording the tenantry ad interim italics protection from excessive rents pending a final solution of the land question it had been judged expedient however to bring in two bills to effect the purpose of these resolutions that suspending ejectments for two years had been entrusted to the lord mayor of dublin and the other which afforded ad interim italics protection was taken charge of by mr o'c power a telegram had just been received from the lord mayor regretting that illness prevented him from making progress with his measure and requesting as the matter was so important and he was prevented by official duties from returning immediately to london that the bill might be intrusted to some other member the committee having considered the question of ad interim italics protection decided to adopt the measure drafted by dr commins and introduced by mr o'c power it was not at all mr parnell said of a pretentious character and in adopting it as a means of affording temporary protection the committee were guided by a reasonable expectation of obtaining its passage this session and also because it would remedy permanently an important defect in the land act of it by no means purported to be an adequate amendment of that act as it only dealt with one section the 9th and by repealing a portion of this section removed the restriction which limited the discretionary power of the county chairman to give the full disturbance whenever he was of opinion that the rent was not a fair and reasonable one the committee believed if this bill became law it would to a great extent meet at all events for a time one of the most pressing difficulties in connection with the existing situation of the tenantry in the land act as it now stood the chairman was prevented by a portion of the 9th section from giving compensation for eviction for non payment of rent unless he deemed the rent exorbitant and it was calculated that if this bill became law the guarantee which the evicted tenant would have of obtaining compensation for improvements in all cases would have a very important effect the government mr parnell continued had announced their intention of dealing with the land question next session in all its branches industrially and otherwise and he considered they could clearly insist on such an amending bill as the present in the meantime though of course it only dealt with one section of the act of as regards the proposal measure suspending ejectments for two years the bill had been drafted but pending further communication with the lord mayor it was not felt desirable to take action the committee thought by the passage of the other bill that its object would be perhaps met considering the effect which the amendment of the 9th section was calculated to produce but the second bill would still be kept on the order book in case of eventualities mr parnell then moved that the party do adopt the bill as drafted by the committee\n",

      "mr parnell having received the address on rising to speak was most enthusiastically received the whole of the vast audience rising en masse italics he said that he could assure them how deeply he was touched and how exceedingly proud he was for the magnificent and spontaneous reception they had accorded to him he wished to thank them exceedingly for the beautiful address which their chairman had presented to him he did not wish in alluding to some of the circumstances touched upon in that address to flog a dead horse in the shape of the late conservative government hisses but at the same time as a matter of history in referring to some of the points mentioned in the address he would be obliged to bear a little hard upon a fallen foe hear hear a voice serve them right mr parnell they would recollect the history of the summer preceding his visit to america with his friend mr dillon last may they advised the tenantry of ireland to claim a fair reduction of their rents from the landlords and they pointed out that owing to the inclemency of the summer the harvest would undoubtedly be more or less short if not a total failure and they assured the tenant farmers of ireland that at least the only way to save themselves who were tenants of small holdings from famine was to claim a fair abatement in their rents it was a remarkable fact that those of the tenantry in the west of ireland any of whom were very poor who followed the advice given had not been compelled up to this day to join their rent paying neighbours in having recourse to the relief committees for their daily bread they also warned the government at the same time of what must be the result of the season of last summer and called upon them to adopt suitable measures of relief pointing out that only the government could hope to cope with a calamity of such an enormous magnitude what was the answer that the government gave at the very time that should have necessitated these measures of relief which were too late now for any effectual purpose they answered the tale of the starving people of ireland by arresting messrs davitt daly killeen and brennan hisses it was about a month after this that mr dillon and he mr parnell proceeded to america he must tell them that the original intention of their mission was not one of charity or alms begging they had originally intended to apply themselves solely to the purpose of disclosing to the american people the terrible condition of land tenure in ireland cheers and to ask their assistance in helping them to abolish that feudal system of land tenure which had been the source of all their troubles but just as they were about to start so many and such accumulated evidences of the distress and famine which was coming to the country forced themselves upon their attention that they felt themselves obliged to abandon the original portion of their mission and to appeal to the charity of the american public for relief to save the irish people from dying cheers and he was proud to say that in every part of the great union of the united states in every little town in every small place throughout that vast country a response a noble response was given to their appeal applause he had calculated that fully to had come during the last three months in one shape or another from america to ireland cheers and altogether as the result of the charity of the world they had received a sum of not less than a quarter of a million of pounds sterling now what had the government done during this time several voices nothing during the four months when probably half a million of people in ireland had been depending for their daily bread and the poorest kind of daily bread too indian meal upon the various relief committees which were organised in the distressed counties and provinces the only thing done up to the present moment by the government of england to cope with this distress was the passing of a bill which by the admission of the present chief secretary for ireland had proved and must continue to prove entirely inadequate and useless for the purposes contemplated shame under that act the act for the relief of distress in ireland of last session power was taken to lend their own money irish money not english money but money made in ireland by irish tenant farmers the property of the late protestant church in ireland power was taken to lend that money at one per cent to the irish landlords for the purpose of improving their parks and estates groans now up to the present time not more than of the money so lent had been issued to these landlords and but a very small portion of it indeed had been spent in wages so that probably not more than or of this been spent in wages throughout the whole of ireland shame and from the nature of the case probably not more than half of this money had actually been spent in affording employment to persons who were distressed and suffering from starvation shame so that they saw the net results of the exertions of parliament to afford relief to the irish people during four or five months of famine had been the actual expenditure up to the present moment of the net result was that out of lent to the landlords for the purpose of improving their estates probably a very small sum not much exceeding had been spent for the purpose of relief shame he was sorry to say that the present government showed signs of following in the evil footsteps of its predecessors in this respect because although they had expressed the greatest sympathy and although they had told them that they were watching the extension of the distress in ireland with the utmost anxiety and that they were most desirous of doing something to meet the distress yet they had not up to the present moment attempted to do anything more than their predecessors in the way of adopting any real methods for that purpose they had just introduced a bill the relief of distress ireland bill which simply sought to stereotype the acts adopted by the conservative government last session and they were going to ask to appropriate another of their own irish money that of the irish church for the purpose of making loans as regarded this question of charity he had always thought that if they were only entitled to appeal to charity until they had had the opportunity of directing the attention of the government in parliament to the necessity of doing something to relieve the distress and that considering that the irish constituencies had responded in the most unexampled manner to the appeal which was made to them by sending determined courageous and energetic men to represent them cheers he thought they were not entitled to ask america or any other country for any more charity until the irish members had exhausted all the means at their disposal to endeavour to get the government of the day to do their duty in this respect cheers he believed that they could obtain satisfactory measures of relief from the present government hear hear and he felt convinced that it would be their own fault if they did not succeed cheers a measure would be brought to a second reading on monday and upon the attitude of the irish party would on that occasion depend very much the result of the exertions that they might make in that direction the attitude he thought of the irish party towards the present government ought to be one of reserve hear hear until they saw what the government was going to do in fulfilment of its ordinary duty as a government a distinguished member of the irish party said they ought to maintain an attitude of watchful expectation laughter yes shut your eyes and open your mouth and see what you will get loud laughter that was the attitude which the irish members had been adopting ever since the union and with very poor results as far as the interests of their country and their constituents had been concerned he had no hesitation in saying that upon the judgment of the government upon this question of the relief of the distress in ireland and upon the question of land tenure in ireland and the measures to be adopted by them this session and next session to enable the irish tenant to reap the fruits of his industry must very largely depend the attitude of the irish party and further he would say the future progress of liberal institutions in england cheers he did not intend to detain the meeting at any great length as he understood that this large gathering formed but a portion of the proposed proceedings of the evening but he would say in conclusion that he had been placed by the election of chairman of the irish parliamentary party cheers a voice the right man in the right place mr parnell in a position of very great difficulty and responsibility he could assure them that up to the moment when he was nominated for the post by his hon and gallant friend colonel o'gorman mahon he was strongly opposed to becoming a candidate for the position the post however was forced upon him by the circumstances of the case he could have wished for instance that his esteemed friend the chairman of that evening mr justin mccarthy would have allowed himself to have been placed in nomination and he felt convinced that it would have been better from every point of view if he had so permitted no no however the thing had been done and they must make the best of it but he could not conceal from himself that his opportunities for usefulness might be very much diminished for the future in consequence no no the difficulties of the position were undoubtedly very great they must recollect that the irish party were composed of gentlemen of different opinions shame and that there were in that party many able men of much greater ability and far longer political experience than his own who thought very differently from him as to the means to be adopted for carrying out certain views he was unable to say at present how much assistance or the reverse he could expect from this section and from these gentlemen a voice they must help you mr parnell but he trusted that the irish party might remain as it undoubtedly was then united and strong loud cheers he believed that it was the wish of the majority of the active members of the party that no excuse should be afforded to the minority to break away from them the appearance of disunion had arisen from the fact that perhaps two thirds or three fourths of the irish members sat in opposition and that the remaining portion had followed the government across the floor of the house shame and had sat on the government side he was bound to say that he regretted this appearance of disunion but at the same time he thought it was more an appearance than a reality hear hear and that although it undoubtedly looked bad and had many disadvantages attendant upon it yet he thought that perhaps by mutual forbearance no practical inconvenience would result from it and that after a time they might gradually draw those gentlemen who now sat on the government side of the house back again and induce them to sit on the other side the future was entirely before them and he repeated that night and as he had said often that he believed the irish people and the irish parliamentary party could obtain anything that they wanted in reason and that it would be their fault if they failed in obtaining these things cheers the appearances so far as they had gone looked favourable for the future but they must not all themselves to be deceived too much by appearances and it might at any time become the duty of the irish members to fight just as strongly and to offer as strenuous an opposition to the liberal government as they had offered to a conservative government and now he would conclude by thanking them for the kindness and patience with which they had listened to him and to assure them that he felt proud of the great honour they had done him and he trusted in the future that he would not forfeit their confidence loud applause\n",

      "mr parnell in moving that the bill be now read a second time said he hoped the house would allow him to take that stage of it on the present occasion he should not have moved the second reading at so late an hour but for the pressing emergency of the case and because if he now neglected the opportunity of not obtaining the opinion of the house concerning the measure such an opportunity would not again arise owing to the difficulty which private members found in obtaining consideration for their bills the provisions of his bill were of a very simple character in the first place he proposed to appoint a commission which should be charged with the relief of distress in ireland the commission to consist of the chairman and two honorary secretaries of the principal organization which had been engaged in distributing the sums subscribed in relief of distress in ireland during the past half year the commission would have the usual power of appointing a chairman and he proposed that there should be set aside for the purposes of relief of distress in ireland of the surplus funds of the irish church which should be used as the commissioners might think fit in relief of distress in ireland it was of course dangerous to use the saying of president lincoln to swap horses when crossing a stream but this seemed to be the process which was being pursued by the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of ireland in reference to this question of relieving distress in ireland for six months the relief committees had afforded assistance to the distressed districts with but little assistance from the poor law boards or the relief works the subscriptions which these bodies had collected and distributed had now however almost come to an end and they were face to face with the position that during the next month or six weeks some people who had been fed through the agency of the committees to which he had referred would have no one to look to for their daily bread the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant said he relied upon out door relief as a means of meeting the difficulty but this system of relief was dependent upon the boards of guardians which in ireland had never been employed for this purpose he was of opinion that he spoke the sentiments of those best able to judge when he said that he viewed with the utmost apprehension the result of trying such an experiment as was suggested by the right hon gentleman who had informed the house that in consequence of certain boards of guardians having failed to do their work he had decided upon dissolving them and appointing officials to do their work this was all very well but he doubted whether such officials would be able to cope with the existing distress the chief secretary had of course the utmost desire to do all that was possible but it was to be feared that the right hon gentleman did not know to the full the nature of the difficulties which were before him and the magnitude of the crisis which was impending it would be difficult to retrace any steps that might be taken after the mischief had happened and the people had died in large numbers of the famine fever which had broken out in many districts of the country in these circumstances he hoped that the house would accept the proposal which was embodied in his bill and would enable the relief committees which had up to the present time done so much good to continue their work with the assistance of a grant of public money until the present crisis had been passed and happily with the blessing of a good harvest the existing distress had been tided over the system of out door relief in ireland was not managed in the same way as it was in england it was in ireland looked on by every poor law guardian with the utmost repugnance and aversion as a plan opposed to all their most cherished convictions and one which in the present instance would necessitate the borrowing of money that would have to be repaid by ratepayers farmers and others who were reduced to great straits by the same circumstances which caused the poorer classes to be very poor indeed he was afraid that the chief secretary would recognize the dislike to the system of out door relief too late either to save his reputation as a minister or to save the lives of many of the irish people he believed that his proposal would prevent much suffering and save many lives within the next six or seven weeks and he therefore asked the house to read it a second time promising that when the committee stage was reached he would carefully consider any proposal that might be made for its amendment the hon gentleman concluded by moving the second reading of the bill motion made and question proposed that the bill be now read a second time mr pamell mr parnell said he had no desire to do anything other than to relieve irish distress and if it was objected that the land league should not be intrusted with part of the work of distribution he should be perfectly willing to omit it from the bill mr parnell agreed to the adjournment of the debate and said he would put the bill on the paper for the following monday on the understanding that no unfair advantage should be taken of the adjournment to block the further progress of the measure\n",

      "mr parnell said it was with the utmost reluctance that as an irish protestant a member of the synod of the protestant church of ireland and the parochial nominator of his parish chosen by the votes of his fellow protestants to that office he wished to explain his reasons for the vote which he intended to give for the resolution of the prime minister he could not recollect any time when he had felt greater timidity less confidence in the result of the action which he was about to take or less confident in the belief that the mass of the irish people were behind him than upon the present occasion in his past political life he had always felt that his action would be understood and appreciated by his constituents but upon the present occasion he was bound to believe there was at all events very great risk of its being misunderstood his religion however taught him to be just and fear not and although a man might be placed under a temporary cloud or a temporary disqualification he thought and felt convinced that in the long run if he acted according to the just dictates of his own conscience every right thinking man at home in ireland would ultimately come to his support now why did he intend to vote for the resolution of the prime minister because he believed that the law entitled mr bradlaugh to take his seat in that house and he objected to that method of making law by parliamentary resolution if those gentlemen on the opposition side of the house desired to keep mr bradlaugh out of the house and who said they desired to do so because the law was against his views if they desired what they said why did they not legally test the question but what had they done they had prevented any legal test from being taken they had deliberately prevented the action of the ordinary law of the land and they had deliberately prevented an important constituency like northampton from having its right of representation in the house of commons now a cry had been raised against him mr parnell in ireland that he was an atheist because he voted for the admission of mr bradlaugh he wished to say that mr bradlaugh religious tenets and his doctrines with reference to over population were abominable but because he mr parnell objected to that gentleman doctrines on those questions was not a sufficient reason why he should go contrary to the law catholic members for ireland had felt very strongly on the question very strongly indeed and they had been told that they ought to recollect that it was once sought to keep them out just as it was now sought to keep mr bradlaugh out but he would ask the catholic members what did they fear did they fear that their religion would be injured by mr bradlaugh introduction to the house no no if they did not then upon what principle did they proceed he had listened carefully to many of the speeches of his catholic friends from ireland and it had appeared to him that they had argued that it was their duty as catholics to keep mr bradlaugh out of the house lest their religion should be injured by his introduction no no then for what other reason did they object to his coming there an appeal had been made to catholic ireland they had been told that that little island was the last country that had resisted the inroads of continental infidelity and that unless they desired that that odious thing should creep into ireland they must keep mr bradlaugh out of the house well that surely seemed to indicate a fear on the part of irish catholics that their religion might be injured by mr bradlaugh introduction into the house but were they entitled really to look at it from that point of view were they as catholics entitled to say because we are catholics we object to mr bradlaugh for they must recollect exactly the same argument was used against their own admission why were catholics deprived of their civil rights for centuries why were they prevented from coming into that house it was because protestants feared that the admission of catholics would injure the protestant religion and it was because the majority of protestants began to see that even if they had that fear it was an unworthy fear and a fear that they ought not to allow to influence them in considering the civil rights of their fellowmen that catholics were at last admitted to the same civil and religious rights as protestants they must never forget that in dealing with this subject if they once admitted the principle that they were entitled to object to a man because his doctrines were likely to injure their religion they struck at the very root of civil and religious liberty and that was why he felt it his duty to do that which was personally odious to him it was a personally odious task for him to undertake to vote for the admission of the hon member for northampton mr bradlaugh to that house but if he had to walk through that lobby by himself he should feel himself a coward if he refused to do so\n",

      "mr parnell said that he should ask the house to allow him to occupy it a few minutes while he stated the course which hon members from ireland wished to take with regard to the bill it would be in the recollection of the house that the debate was adjourned when the matter was under consideration on a previous occasion in order that the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland might consult his colleagues as to the course he should take the result of that consultation was that the right hon gentleman gave notice of a certain new clause to the government belief of distress bill with the view of meeting the objections of the irish members irish members thought that it was of the utmost importance that some grant should be given if they pleased to the poor law boards in ireland for the purpose of enabling them to meet quickly any pressing emergency which might arise in their opinion the advance of money at per cent to the poor law boards would not be sufficient to enable those bodies to adopt a quick and speedy action for the relief of distress in other words they considered that the power of granting out door relief given by the act of last session would not be of use unless some means were adopted to enable boards to take speedy action they thought that if a grant of were given out of the church surplus to the poor law boards that was to the poor law machinery of the government there would be a desire on the part of those boards to put into operation the act of last session and they would at once commence to distribute out door relief and would co operate with the right hon gentleman the chief secretary in putting the machinery of the act into operation what was the position of these unions many of them were practically bankrupt they had exhibited the greatest repugnance to borrowing money from the government and they would continue to exhibit that repugnance so long as no further means were provided for them mr parnell said that he did not wish to trouble the house at any length but was only exercising his right to reply to the observations which had been made on the second reading he would merely say in conclusion that it was of the utmost importance that the machinery for the distribution of out door relief should be set to work at once therefore they advocated the grant in order to insure the speedy action of the poor law guardians mr parnell said he proposed to proceed with the motion for the second reading unless some proposition were made by the government mr parnell said they were in this position they thought it absolutely necessary that there should be some grant in aid of the distress in ireland and they were perfectly willing to allow the government to choose the machinery to administer the fund they had expressed their preference for bodies which had already successfully administered money in ireland up to the present time but if the government desired to administer the money through the poor law machinery they were willing to agree to that arrangement but the difficulty in regard to the bill of the chief secretary for ireland was that it was complicated with so many collateral questions that it was utterly impossible to say when the particular part of the bill connected with the present subject would be reached they knew that the time of the government was exceedingly limited but they knew also that there was a great emergency in ireland which required immediate action the government had presented a bill of cumbrous size for the purpose of repairing the errors of their predecessors if he mr parnell agreed to the adjournment of the debate he did not know when his bill could come on while the notice on the paper that it be read a second time that day three months would remain if the government would allow him to put his bill down for saturday the proposal might be made the subject of consideration in the meantime and perhaps some satisfactory arrangement might be arrived at he asked the government to consider their position a grave responsibility had been cast upon them by their constituents to do all they could for them he thought the right hon gentleman was making a grave miscalculation in relying on the poor law machinery and that he might find himself in the midst of a state of affairs which he had not contemplated mr parnell said he agreed with his hon friend the member for mayo mr o'connor power that the debate might be now adjourned but it should be remembered that he had proposed that plan at the beginning although he feared he had been misunderstood by the chief secretary for ireland he had proposed that the right hon gentleman should adopt the principle of a grant reserving to himself the right of administration by the poor law board and it was only at that moment that the chief secretary for ireland had pointed out how it could be done mr parnell said he wished to see the block motion taken off the paper for saturday and would move that the bill be read a second time on that day motion made and question proposed that the debate be adjourned till saturday mr parnell\n",

      "mr parnell the words were ceased to circulate it mr parnell said he was glad that the government had announced their intention of dealing with the question of arrears because he believed by a settlement on the lines indicated by the right hon gentleman the prime minister the pacification of ireland would be better secured than by any number of coercion bills such as that which was introduced the other evening he wished to express his thanks to the hon member for the county of clare mr o'shea for the very able and clear statement he had made of what had passed between himself and that hon member the letter which he wrote to the hon member was marked private and confidential on his hon friend visit to him in kilmainham he asked for and obtained his permission to show it to one other person he did not wish to find fault with him for having handed it to the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant although certainly he had no intention that it should have fallen into his hands but as he had said he did not wish to find fault with his hon friend for the responsibility he had taken upon himself in this matter he had felt with reference to the question of arrears in ireland as relating to the situation of the smaller tenants the very gravest anxiety and responsibility for many months and he was rejoiced that the hon member had found some way of placing the views of himself and those with him before the government they had been aware from what they had seen in the newspapers and from the information of prisoners who came in from time to time and who received letters from different parts of the country that evictions in large and very much greater numbers than had occurred up to the present were imminent unless some such proposal as the prime minister had announced were made in regard to arrears they had anticipated that there would be three times as many evictions in the present quarter of the year as there were in the first quarter when persons were turned out of their homes they had also every reason to believe that owing to the fact that the smaller tenantry in mayo galway sligo and parts of roscommon donegal leitrim and kerry were sunk in arrears to the extent of three or four years in many cases four or five or six years and in some cases or years the year or half year rent by the payment of which the tenants had obtained a temporary respite from eviction would be but a temporary respite and that the coming winter would see evictions resumed against the smaller tenants to an extent never witnessed in the country since they feared also that the outrages which had been so numerous during the last six months would increase as the winter came on and that a state of affairs in ireland would follow owing to the non settlement of this question the end of which they could not possibly foresee the right hon gentleman the late chief secretary had given his account of the conversation which he held with the hon member for the county of clare in which a certain statement was made as to what he mr parnell would do in the event of the arrears question being settled he thought the expression was used that the same organization which had been used to promote outrages would be used to put them down mr o'shea dissented his hon friend shook his head at that and he was glad to see that he did so because if his hon friend had been under the impression that he had used any expression of the kind or that he had conveyed to him any such impression in any conversation with him he was entirely mistaken what he had attempted to convey to him was that in his belief the persons who were taking part in these moonlight outrages which he could assure the house he had heard condemned in kilmainham in the strongest terms and which were exceedingly repugnant to their feelings opposition laughter he was perhaps much better able to speak of the actual feelings of his fellow prisoners than those who laughed were the smaller tenantry on the estates who were unable to pay their rent and who were attempting to intimidate or coerce the larger tenantry who were able to pay in order that they might not be evicted after the landlords had obtained the bulk of their rents from the larger tenants he believed that these smaller tenants felt that their only protection was to keep the larger tenantry from paying their rents so that the landlords after the deprivation of their rents might be compelled to come to terms and allow the smaller tenantry not to pay anything that was the origin of the movement which was directed against a class who could pay and its object was to prevent them paying in order that the smaller tenantry should be saved from eviction and allowed to remain on the estate that was the reason why he had been so anxious to press for a settlement of the question of arrears and it might perhaps be in the recollection of the house that last year when the question as to the tenants who could pay and those who could not pay was raised he had publicly offered to advise those who could pay to do so if those who could not were saved from eviction the prime minister at the time appeared to be very much impressed with that statement but unfortunately it was not possible to obtain the introduction of a practical method of settling the arrears into the bill of last year those arrears were in consequence still outstanding and the state of affairs which existed then existed to day the only way in which the smaller tenantry could protect themselves being to get the larger tenantry to refuse to pay rent until fair terms were extended to the former class he had no hesitation in saying that in the face of such a measure as the prime minister had proposed this state of affairs entirely ceased it came to an end because the smaller tenantry would be efficiently protected by the measure of the right hon gentleman and there would be no longer an excuse he would not say for the commission of moonlight outrages but for getting the larger tenantry to refuse to pay their rent in order to protect the smaller tenantry now with regard to mr sheridan name which had been introduced into this discussion the right hon gentleman said he had information with regard to mr sheridan he knew nothing of that but certainly his hon friend mr o'shea must have entirely misunderstood what he believed he had conveyed to him with regard to mr sheridan return to ireland he mr parnell had asked that mr sheridan and mr egan might be permitted to come back in the event of this question being settled he also mentioned mr davitt name saying that it was of great importance that mr davitt should be released mr sheridan was and he had so told his hon friend one of the chief organizers of the land league in connaught he had told his hon friend that if mr sheridan were permitted to return to ireland he believed he would be able to use his influence to discourage the commission of outrages and to induce the tenantry to accept this settlement of the arrears question this influence however was one solely arising from a knowledge which he understood mr sheridan to have obtained during the time he was acting as an organizer of the land league as to the information which the late chief secretary now gave the house it had come upon him entirely by surprise and he could not understand how it was that the right hon gentleman had been able in the statement he had just made to the house to represent the hon gentleman as having stated that he mr parnell was in any way aware of that information mr parnell said he knew mr sheridan he had seen him on several occasions and he had had no reason to believe that he had ever incited to the commission of any crime he believed so still and certainly the statement the right hon gentleman had made had come upon him entirely by surprise he had believed that it would have been well to have permitted mr sheridan and mr egan to have returned to ireland and he believed so still as to mr davitt he was the only person whose release he had spoken of he knew that this gentleman had used the most strenuous exertions to prevent the commission of crime and outrage in ireland and that those exertions had on many occasions been successful if mr davitt had been released he believed he would have been of great assistance in discovering the perpetrators of crime just as he believed that mr sheridan would have been of most important assistance in preventing crime in ireland\n",

      "mr parnell i am sorry sir that the right hon gentleman the prime minister should suppose that there is any intention on our part to offer any unfair or unnecessary opposition to this bill it is not my intention nor do i believe is it the intention of my hon friends to oppose the bill in any way unfairly but i wish to point out that this is a bill of a very wide and sweeping character it proposes to make an alteration in the whole criminal judicature in ireland upon lines which are almost unprecedented even in the sad history of our country and not only so but it involves other consequences of a most far reaching and extended character which none of us can foresee at the present moment and although i do not wish to object to the desire of the right hon gentleman to obtain a second reading of the bill to day i am bound to point out to him that the discussion which we have had upon this measure up to the present time upon this most important stage has been exceedingly superficial and limited i would also further make this appeal the right hon gentleman yesterday said he would feel it right to take the committee stage of the bill on tuesday next i think it is of the utmost importance that amendments which it may be necessary to suggest as additions to or alterations in the bill in committee should be of a practical and well considered character and if we are impelled in this hurried fashion into the committee on a bill of such scope as this i do not see how it is possible for us to avoid the presentation of a mass of matter which may be more or less superfluous and unnecessary and with which we might have no great desire to take up the time of the house i hope the right hon gentleman will be able to see his way to give us a little further time for the consideration of the amendments which we may deem it our duty to move in the committee stage of the bill as regards the bill itself i will only say that i believe to the fullest extent in the good intentions of the right hon gentlemen the prime minister and the chief secretary for ireland mr trevelyan i believe they do not intend through this bill to injure the liberties of our people i believe they intend only to use it against crime but we have heard the same thing before we have heard the same words from the lips of every minister of the crown who since the union has presented a coercion bill for ireland to this house i admit that perhaps the intentions of many of them were not the same as those of the right hon gentleman but coercion bills for ireland have always been presented to this house with the same expression of a desire to preserve public and private liberty which have accompanied the presentation of this bill on the present occasion the right hon gentleman the member for bradford mr w e forster told us he knew the persons against whom the bill of last year was to be used but we know what was the result and we cannot conceive how it is possible that any other result can follow the working of the present measure we do not believe any man is good enough or noble enough to be intrusted with the liberties of a whole people the chief secretary for ireland and the prime minister have said that they do not intend to do this and they do not intend to do that and that they wish to use the bill in a certain way but i wish to point out however that the bill leaves it absolutely in the power and at the discretion of the executive government the representatives of the crown and the police to do what they please as regards the repression of any right private or public or any constitutional action whatever with the best intentions we believe that sooner or later the chief secretary for ireland is bound to be perverted and destroyed by the evil counsels which have reduced the right hon member for bradford to his present position there is in ireland an official circle which represents the minority a very small minority the class of landlords whose traditions are saturated with evil and it is utterly impossible for anyone however strong or however imbued he may be with the principles of liberty to resist the influence and avoid the action of that class for any considerable period it therefore comes to this when we are asked in this bill to surrender everything into the safe keeping of the lord lieutenant and the chief secretary for ireland in resisting that we are entitled to call as a witness to what is likely to happen the experience of the past and to ask whether the nature whether the very nature of the case does not render it impossible that our apprehensions should not be well defined now sir what does the bill do it gives the right to the judges to try and deliver sentence upon cases of treason treason felony murder firing at the person manslaughter and some other offences of a grave though diverse character in other words it puts political offences and horrible crimes upon one and the same footing i do not mean to deny for a moment that political offences are not greatly entitled to your consideration and that you should obtain whatever guarantees you can or may think proper for their prevention but i do deny that you are entitled to choose your judges and your executioners for the infliction of these sentences from the very class of our political opponents against whom we have been fighting in ireland for so many years the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland at an early period of the session amused the house by attempting to prove against me a charge of constructive treason founded upon passages in my speeches the right hon and learned gentleman i hope some day will be a judge all i can say is that i trust he will not be one of the judges upon a tribunal to try me for that offence for i fear that if he did his duty as he supposed he was doing it when he was making the speech in question he would give me a very short shrift and a very short day i mention that as a practical example of one of the reasons why i am naturally disposed to view this bill with apprehension the late mr isaac butt told me once that it would not be possible for any of us to commit any graver offence in the eyes of the law than sedition because he said it was impossible for a public speaker to be indicted upon his speeches alone for any higher office than sedition or seditious libel the hon and learned gentleman was a lawyer of great skill and experience but i regret to find that the judgment of the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland does not coincide with his and that the right hon and learned gentleman considers it is possible for public speakers to be guilty of the crime of constructive treason any public speaker in ireland who hereafter ventures to make a speech will have to do so with the fear of the right hon and learned gentleman before his eyes in his future position which i hope he will attain and which he thoroughly deserves as a judge now i pass to the offences against the act and i must protest against the course pursued by the framers of the bill in reference to this part of it not only do you provide special tribunals for the trial of offences which are offences already provided for according to the ordinary law of the land but you create a special offence and constitute special tribunals for the purpose of trying that offence you create the offence of constructive intimidation and you make it of such a wide character that it is absolutely impossible for any person to do or say anything in ireland no matter what his intentions may be without running the risk of being sent to prison for six months with hard labour now i did not object very much certainly i was willing to undergo the kind of imprisonment to which i have been subjected for the past six or seven months but i certainly think that our local political leaders in ireland ought not to be called upon to stand the risk which would be entailed upon them by that clause of this bill imprisonment with hard labour in ireland is little short of slavery we had in kilmainham some or convict prisoners and i saw how those men were treated i saw how they were half starved to death i saw how with their stomachs empty they were worked like galley slaves and i saw the brutal way in which the warders of those prisons were trained and educated to treat those men and i say i should not be willing to submit our local political leaders to the prospect that is thus unfolded before them i agree with my hon friend the member for sligo mr sexton that under this bill all public actions of any kind whether the land movement or any other movement no matter how constitutional must cease in ireland until this bill expires it will be a matter for us of very great consideration after this bill is passed as to what our future course should be whether we will continue in public life any longer or whether we should leave the question to the right hon gentleman to arrive at whatever solution may be arrived at but however that may be it is our duty i think on the various stages of this measure before it has received the assent of the house to point out these matters to you and to show you the reasons why we fear that although you may attempt to strike at assassins you will in reality be striking constitutional liberty i had hoped that the land league movement with the passage of the arrears bill and with the prospect of further alterations in the land act of last session of a just and equitable character might very shortly have emerged from the state of vehement agitation and activity into a more placid and perhaps a more reasonable condition for my part i should not have objected to such a solution of the questions we have been contending against the right hon gentleman for the last two years we have found him to be a great and a good and a strong man i think it is no dishonour to us to avow that he has fought us in a way we should not wish to be fought again by anybody in the future and i regret that the event in phœnix sic park has prevented him from continuing in the strength of that course and that owing to the supposed exigencies of his party or of his position in that course he has felt himself bound to turn aside from the course of conciliation justice and concession into those horrible paths of coercion which you have often trod before by which your statesmen have always failed even to reach that which they put before themselves when they first started and which i fear on the present occasion will lead to much greater and graver dangers than those of the past\n",

      "mr parnell sir i may remind the right hon gentleman the prime minister that the proceedings of last night indicated that there will be some kind of difficulty in the passage of the arrears of rent bill the opposition then offered to the bill was of a very unusual kind and indicated strong intentions on the part of the minority in this house to oppose that bill and to endeavour to alter and thwart it in every possible way under those circumstances i think we are entitled to ask the prime minister to attach by accepting the amendment of the hon member for kirkcaldy sir george campbell the same importance to one member of the living body as to the other we do not of course desire to interfere with the order of government business but we do think that the government are entitled to ask and to obtain from the house as many facilities for the passage of their remedial measures as they have obtained for their coercive measures they have however unfortunately imitated their mistake of last session in making coercive precede remedial legislation but i trust now that they have the power to do so that they will obtain some guarantees from the opposition controlled by the right hon gentleman the member for north devon sir stafford northcote that this arrears of rent bill will receive fair play at their hands and that as they are now asking for the passage of the coercion bill they will afford facilities for the passing of the arrears of rent bill this is all the more important because as i beg to remind the right hon gentleman the premier the period of redemption is going by in the case of numbers of evicted tenants and they are being placed without the operation of the law and as a consequence they will be left to their own resources or to whatever other resources may be brought into play on their behalf i confess i think such a situation would be deplorable and ought to be very much deprecated and avoided i have been endeavouring during the last few days to obtain an extension of the period of redemption for evicted tenants but owing to the enormous block in the superior court of the land commission which has power to deal with such applications it has been found up to the present moment impossible therefore it happens that the vast number of tenants who since may the period when the present government assumed office have seen all their legal rights depart month by month is being daily augmented i would ask the right hon gentleman to consider under these circumstances whether he would not give some hope to those poor people by showing as is now in his power to show that he attaches equal importance to the arrears of rent bill as he does to the coercion bill mr parnell i was under the impression mr speaker that we were taking a division against the main question which was put before the last division was taken and under these circumstances i desire to accept the division which was taken on this amendment as the definite judgment of the house upon the present motion i do not desire to waste the time of the house by taking a further division upon the main question but i must solemnly protest against the course which the government have adopted in not affording the same facilities for the passage of the arrears of rent bill that they intend to afford for the passage of the coercion bill\n",

      "mr parnell i hope the house will permit me very briefly to refer in the first place to an impression of an unfavorable character which appears to have been created among many members on both sides of the house by the speech of my hon friend the member for tipperary mr dillon yesterday i am bound to say that i think the impression which has been created and the inferences that the prime minister drew in his speech from the remarks of my hon friend were not warranted by the speech itself although i think it is exceedingly natural that both the prime minister and the house generally should have drawn the inferences they did from many passages of that speech and from its general nature and context i can only say that the impression which i am informed my hon friend has created in the house and the impression evidently created on the prime minister was not the impression created by my hon friend upon the hon member for roscommon mr o'kelly and myself when we were his colleagues in kilmainham prison i should not have touched on a delicate matter of this kind were it not that a letter of mine conveying this impression has since become public property what was the impression which the hon member appears to have conveyed to the house yesterday in the best report i can find of his speech he is made to say that if the government should announce in the house their intention to have done with coercion and at the same time to pass a measure similar in character to the bill introduced by the hon member for new ross mr redmond he believed such a condition of things would then be brought about in ireland as would give them every reason to hope that they could conduct the agrarian movement within the land to a satisfactory conclusion without violence without discord of any kind he never for one moment either in private or in public and as far as he was aware none of his friends had ever represented that the passing of an arrears bill would be a settlement of the land question what he did say was that the bill introduced by the irish members prominent in which was a clause dealing with arrears together with a binding announcement on the part of the government and this was essential that they would definitely abandon the policy of coercion would place them in a position in which they could confidently say that in a few months their country would return to peace and that outrage would entirely disappear and then my hon friend after some passages in his speech which i shall not weary the house by quoting went on to defend the practice of boycotting and taking these passages and the subsequent passages of the speech together the prime minister appears to have supposed that my hon friend meant that while exertions would be used to prevent outrages intimidation would be persevered in until the land question was permanently settled now sir knowing as i do the feelings and sentiments of my hon friend i am bound to say that i do not think he intended to convey any such impression i do not think he intended to convey the impression that our exertions to prevent outrages would be dependent on the passage of the arrears bill or that any illegal course in the shape of intimidation would be either entered into or persevered in pending the final settlement of the land question our views in prison since the marked increase of outrages had been that it was most desirable that the country should be tranquillized and the movement kept within the bounds of moderation and we held during these months many anxious consultations as to how we were to contribute towards those ends in addition we did what little we were able to do in our position to tranquillize the country and moderate the excitement of the people and this was months before our release was thought of or any certainty had appeared of the settlement of the arrears question but subsequently when a settlement of the arrears question appeared likely i did not deem it my duty to conceal from my friends that in our judgment this settlement with a fair prospect of remedial legislation of a practical character afterwards would enormously contribute to the pacification of the country and why sir did we think this because we hoped that the settlement of the arrears question which has been proposed by the prime minister would have a material effect in stopping unjust evictions for a while and that the permanent legislation we then hoped for and still hope for would to a certain extent lead to a gradual transfer by purchase on fair and equitable terms of the soil of ireland to her people and that evictions would in this way be permanently put an end to i know of nobody connected with the land question who expects that the tenants of ireland can obtain the ownership of their farms otherwise than by fair purchase that was the original object of the land league movement our efforts were to be directed firstly to putting an end so sic rack renting eviction and landlord extermination and secondly to enabling the tenant farmers to purchase their holdings upon fair and equitable terms neither my hon friend the member for tipperary nor mr davitt expects that the tenants of ireland can obtain their holdings upon any other terms than by buying them now sir perhaps i may be permitted to refer to a speech which i delivered at the commencement of this movement in ennis in the autumn of which has been often quoted i then recommended for the first time what has been roughly described as the practice of boycotting in that speech i recommended that persons who took farms from which other tenants had been unjustly evicted i believe there was some difference between the government and myself as to whether i used the word unjustly or not but whether i used it or not i intended to have used it and i used it in subsequent speeches that persons who took farms from which other tenants had been unjustly evicted should be isolated and placed in a species of moral coventry and i used the expression that they should be left severely alone i desire mr speaker to admit to the fullest extent that the practice of boycotting which grew up subsequently to that speech has been very much abused it has been used not only against persons who robbed their neighbors by taking their holdings from them after they had been unjustly evicted robbed them of their tenant right which had not then been conferred by law but which has since been recognized and conferred by law but it has been used against persons who refused to join the land league who refused to illuminate their houses and who refused to subscribe to various popular movements it has been used in a variety of other ways which merit the severest the most stringent condemnation i agree with my hon friend the member for tipperary that what i then recommended in that speech at ennis would not have been legitimate in a country where the law protected the interests of the poor as well as those of the rich it would not have been permissible to have recommended it in a self governed country but the house must reflect what were the circumstances which then existed in ireland and what was the position in which the tenant farmers were placed they had just passed through three seasons of extraordinary and exceptional severity when many thousands of them probably of the tenant farmers of ireland were only kept from actual starvation by the charity of the world the right hon gentleman the prime minister and this house had in the session of which was then over made an ineffectual attempt to protect those men from extermination that attempt had been frustrated by the action of the house of lords were we to stand by and do nothing to allow these people to be evicted in their thousands as they undoubtedly would have been if we had not done something our method was perhaps a rough one but it was necessary that rough measures should under the circumstances be employed the irish land question is a rough and thorny question no matter which end you lay hold of but i freely admit that means which were recommended then would not be permissible or allowable if the immediate object at which the land league aimed namely the protection of tenants from rack renting eviction and landlord extermination could have been arrived at by the ordinary process of law we are now in this position we are promised an arrears bill which if it be carried as it has been printed and read a second time will undoubtedly temporarily protect the small tenants of ireland from unjust evictions i should have looked upon that step as an enormous advance an enormous safeguard it would have given time for the further consideration by the government of what steps could be taken for the development of the act of last session for its speedier bringing into effect for the more speedy protection of the tenants under its operation it would have given all parties in the contest a breathing time a breathing time which i venture to say and which both my hon friends who were with me in kilmainham concurred in believing was very much wanted at that moment by all parties the situation has been changed i shall explain a little further on how much changed by the introduction of the coercion bill by the government and i cannot help thinking that very much of the tenor and character of the speech of my hon friend the member for tipperary was due to the despair he feels in his heart at the prospect that is before ireland and her people under the provisions of this prevention of crime bill it illustrates strangely the anomaly of the position of ireland in this house that we are told that when that speech is made one of the results is that or fair minded englishmen who intended to assist us in modifying this bill in mitigating its harshness and i would almost say its brutality have been driven away from our side no that is what i am told i myself do not wish to believe that that is the case but i would ask the house to make some little allowance for the exigencies of ireland and for the position of her members and to remember that after all it is exceedingly difficult for english members to understand the exact position of any irish question and if they do err let them take care that their error be on the side of justice and mercy rather on the side of excessive coercion and harshness if the arrears question had been settled i should have advised that the movement should have been conducted strictly within the laws applicable to england and to ireland i am now referring to the question of boycotting i do not object mr speaker to the enforcement of any law against intimidation or incitement to intimidation but i object to the construction of a fresh offence of intimidation unknown to your law and which would practically make any legal or open combination impossible i claim for the irish tenants as much right to combine as much right to combination as is allowable to english workmen and no more and i am perfectly willing that suitable definitions in accordance with the nature of the case in addition to the definitions of the conspiracy act of should be inserted in the present bill to carry out this object i think the premier made an unfair deduction with reference to another passage in the speech of my hon friend the passage is as follows he mr dillon had never denounced outrage and never would until parliament denounced evictions but he had endeavored to point out to the people that their own interests both as regarded their good name before the world which had now been sadly blotted by their enemies and the protection of their rights and the future welfare of their country distinctly lay in putting a stop to outrage and he had endeavored to point out to them that a weapon lay near their hands which could take the place of outrage i have had no communication with my hon friend but i am quite sure that he referred to unjust evictions the prime minister went on to say that eviction is the exercise of an undoubted legal right which may be to the prejudice of your neighbor which may involve the very highest moral responsibility nay even deep moral guilt upon the person exercising it there may be outrages all things considered the persons and the facts that may be less guilty in the sight of god than evictions that i do not deny but there may be evictions which are the last the extreme the inevitable remedy for the establishment of those legal rights on which the existence of society depends against the man who deliberately and insolently and willfully denies them the man who audaciously refuses to fulfill his contract the most equitable contract in the world a contract under the judicial rents recently established with money in his pocket perhaps loaded with benefits from the man whom he defies and in the case where the possessor of property after exhausting every means of conciliation is driven to make use of the powers of the law for the establishment of legal right and perhaps to support himself and family that man is placed by the deliberate declaration of the hon gentleman upon the footing of a perpetrator of outrage and we are called upon to denounce evictions with the same sense and even with the same unlimited scope as we are allowed to denounce outrage i do not think that was the intention of my hon friend and i feel certain he would regret any outrage which was committed with reference to a case of eviction where the tenant was able to pay his rent and where the rent was a rent which was under the circumstances of the case fair we have been very much blamed by various critics in consequence of the number of outrages which have happened in connection with the land agitation but i think when the passions of the day have passed away it will be admitted by history that no movement of the same magnitude involving the same extensive results and connected as it is with the means of living of such a large portion of the population of the country has ever been freer from outrage and crime than has the land league movement the facilities which are now given by the penny press and by the electric telegraph for the speedy dissemination of news the careful way in which the english newspapers dish up everything of the kind that happens in ireland for their english readers and a great deal that has never happened at all brings every crime or offence connected with the land league movement into a prominence which it never could have obtained or years ago i wish the house would permit me to compare the crime which attended the movement of when the interests involved were not one fifth of those involved in the land league movement the movement of was to get rid of the tithe rent charge a payment amounting to about and roughly speaking this agitation is to get rid of the payment of some or a year the difference between what the irish tenants consider a fair rent and what the landlords consider a fair rent the chief secretary gave us the other day a list of the murders which had been committed in ireland during the last year he said that in the year there were murders now in the year there were murders mr trevelyan the list i gave was of agrarian murders i think the hon gentleman should draw a distinction though i know it is almost impossible to do so mr parnell of course it is very difficult to draw a distinction but so far as i can gather murders in were committed in connection with the tithe movement just as the agrarian murders last year were supposed to have been committed in connection with the land league in queen county alone there were in murders and in kilkenny there were murders or attempts at murder burnings of houses burglaries houghings of cattle and assaults of such a nature as to be accompanied with loss of life the catalogue of irish crime during that year contained homicides houghings of cattle illegal notices illegal meetings malicious injuries to property attacks on houses arsons and serious assaults the aggregate of crime during these months amounted to yet when parliament met it was not asked to sanction so stringent a coercion bill as that now before the house in those days the state of ireland was not so vividly brought home to the minds of the english people and there was not the same disposition to make political capital out of such events i admit to the fullest extent the difficulties in the way of ministers but i do not admit that there is any justification whatever in the present rapidly improving state of ireland which entitles the government to turn aside from remedial measures and to enter on this course of fresh coercion the prime minister is losing a very great chance indeed a chance which may not which i fear cannot ever come back to him and which perhaps never will come to any english statesman occupying the position of the right hon gentleman certainly to no one so well qualified by his ability and grasp of mind to bring the irish land question to a satisfactory termination i believe that from the date of the phoenix park murders every class in ireland landlords tenants labourers were disposed for a settlement of the question on as moderate lines as could be hoped for i feel convinced no section of political thought in ireland not even the most extreme section were desirous that the present state of turmoil and agitation should continue and be perpetual and if the prime minister had been able to proceed with his arrears bill without loss of time and after that to have considered on what conditions he ought to amend the land act of i believe it would have been possible for him to propose such a measure as would have restored peace and quiet to the country and in a few years to have brought about a permanent settlement of the irish question we have now before us a prospect of coercion and i ask the right hon gentleman to consider in what position moderate men in ireland are placed by coercion last year the passage of a coercion act threw the land league movement into the hands of its most extreme members this year i cannot see any other hope than that the passage of this coercion bill will throw everything in ireland into the hands of secret societies between the secret societies on the one side and her majesty government on the other it will be practically impossible for any irish politician to continue in existence although the prime minister has said that the government having proposed this measure would not deserve to remain in office a single week if they were now to draw back from it i would entreat him to re consider the situation the return of outrages in ireland last week showed a diminution of a very large proportion of these crimes being threatening letters and notices and i trust and pray that this month may show a similar diminution so as to strengthen the hands of those english members in the house and those members of the cabinet who may be supposed to be engaged in the attempt to strengthen the hands of the government against those who are demanding vindictive and fresh coercive measures against ireland at all events let the effect of the arrears bill be tried there is surely no urgency about this coercion bill you have power to imprison and keep in prison without trial that you suspect in ireland you admit that many thousands of families are threatened with eviction the passage of this coercion bill must be attended with a considerable loss of time no matter how much we may desire to refrain from obstructive opposition i would in treat the government not to play into the hands of the men who committed the phoenix park murders by persistence in their present course the extermination of the secret societies of a country by any code has been proved to be impossible russia has sufficiently drastic laws and immense power and yet we see what happens in that country do not then shut the door in the face of those among the irish people the vast majority of the irish people who desire to see her majesty government return to constitutional usage and to accept any measure which may promise to be a lasting and final settlement of this much vexed irish land question\n",

      "mr parnell said that in the absence of the hon member for dungarvan mr o'donnell he would move the amendment which stood in his name namely in page line after lieutenant insert and chief secretary to the lord lieutenant conjointly on sworn information to be communicated to parliament without delay he wished to point out to the committee that it was most desirable while they had every confidence in the lord lieutenant personally that his extreme responsibility under this bill should be shared by the chief secretary the lord lieutenant was not so to speak responsible to parliament certainly he was not responsible to the house of commons he was not in his place in the house of commons from day to day in the same way that the chief secretary was and as far as he mr parnell could see it was not possible for the lord lieutenant to attend in his place in the other house so that practically speaking the action of the lord lieutenant would not be subjected to parliamentary control in the ordinary sense of having questions directly addressed to him under those circumstances he mr parnell felt he was entitled to ask that this very grave responsibility should be shared by the chief secretary and that the right hon gentleman who filled the present post and who was in his place in the house of commons from day to day should be taken into the counsel of the lord lieutenant when these commissions were issued he mr parnell therefore begged to move the amendment which stood in the name of the hon member for dungarvan mr o'donnell amendment proposed in page line after the word lieutenant to insert the words and chief secretary to the lord lieutenant conjointly on sworn information to be communicated to parliament without delay mr parnell question proposed that those words be there inserted mr parnell remarked that the first two lines of the clause placed the power of issuing commissions in the hands of the lord lieutenant solely and all he asked the government was that they should allow the very important responsibility imposed by the clause to be shared by some other person who should be a member of the house of commons he could well understand that a great deal of the popular estimation in which the commission was held would depend very much upon its composition and he did not think therefore that it was too much to ask the government to agree that this very important responsibility should be shared by a commoner he had no wish in the slightest degree to detract from lord spencer capability and fairness of mind but he submitted that a power of this kind which left one man and that man not a member of the house of commons with the power of selecting juries of judges for the trial of persons for offences in reference to which death sentences were involved it was not an unfair request to make to the government that the responsibility should be shared by the chief secretary of course the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary would say that the lord lieutenant was responsible to parliament undoubtedly he was responsible to parliament but in such a way as to render his responsibility useless so far as any power existed in the house of commons of checking any cases which might occur under the bill he hoped the right hon and learned gentleman would reconsider his decision and would not refuse the request which had been made to him mr parnell said the object of his hon friend the member for wexford mr healy was not to interfere with the nature of the offences or to limit their description in any way but rather to prevent the bill from giving the irish courts a jurisdiction more extensive than that which they possessed at present as the home secretary had pointed out the irish courts at the present moment had jurisdiction to try the offences of treason and treason felony whether part of the offence might have bean sic committed outside the jurisdiction or whether it had been wholly committed within the jurisdiction of the courts the amendment of his hon friend did not interfere with that and although he mr parnell would not say that the amendment best expressed what he wanted to see carried out yet it would be evident to anyone who had considered the bill that it was necessary to guard against conferring any jurisdiction upon the irish courts other than that which they possessed at present that was to say that they should not have power given to them by the bill to try any offence without a jury which they did not possess at present to try with a jury he thought if the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary could see his way to state if he approved of this view that he would consider the matter and endeavour to frame words in order to meet the object his hon friend the member for wexford had in view the right hon and learned gentleman would get rid of a considerable amount of difficulty mr parnell said he was not prepared to deal with the questions of treason and treason felony in the manner proposed by the bill the point whether treason and treason felony were to be included in the bill was still to be discussed and still to be decided by the committee and if they limited the date in regard to treason and treason felony they would be practically begging the question altogether and deciding that treason and treason felony were to be offences within the jurisdiction of this special commission it seemed clear enough that the intention of the home secretary was to provide that there should be retrospective action as regarded graver crimes that seemed at first sight fair enough but they were able to point to the fact that there had been no failure of justice wherever a murderer had been detected and brought before a jury in ireland during the last two years they had challenged the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland to say whether in his opinion there had been any failure of justice in such cases and whether any verdict had been given against the weight of evidence in a murder trial in ireland he had watched the cases which had been tried very carefully and he must say it seemed to him to be the opinion of the law officers of the crown and the public opinion generally that in murder cases when brought to trial the decisions which the juries arrived at were overwhelmingly in accordance with the evidence that the persons acquitted were rightly acquitted and that no other decision could have been come to on the evidence if the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland were in his place he would ask him if he did not coincide with him mr parnell in this view whether in any of the four murder trials which took place last year the verdict of the jury did not appear to him to be in accordance with the weight of evidence and whether he as one of the law officers of the crown had any fault to find with the decisions arrived at they had no wish to evade the punishment of murder but they knew very well that wherever a power of this kind was given in ireland it simply led to the springing up of the common informer of whom they had seen a few forerunners already in all probability history would only be repeated in this case and they would see innocent men brought before these tribunals and perhaps executed on false and perjured testimony there was another point which might fairly be pressed upon the government they had had offences committed in ireland during the last two years against the law by a certain number of desperate men and what was more certain to make these men still more desperate and induce them to commit still further acts against the law than to tell them that they were to be brought before this exceptional tribunal and that no sort of amnesty would be held out to them for anything they might have done in the past the measure would only have the effect of making them believe that it was not merely justice but harsh vengeance which was to be exacted against them there was nothing therefore more likely to make those men determined to destroy peace and tranquillity in ireland than an inflexible resolution of this kind he believed there was a feeling in ireland at the present moment which if it were not checked by the introduction of this coercion bill would have been quite sufficient of itself to have put down outrages without the assistance of any measure of this kind by adopting a harsh and vindictive policy the government would simply render these men desperate and supply every inducement in their power to make them take measures to secure that there should not be peace and that return of quietude which all of them so much desired he thought they were entitled under these circumstances and in view of the fact that juries had invariably in ireland in trials for murder and in the very grave penalties and punishment which were involved in cases of murder given their verdicts in accordance with the weight of evidence to ask that the government should re consider their position and withdraw the retrospective action of the bill trials for murder had not failed in ireland juries had been willing to convict whenever any substantial evidence was given and until the law officers of the crown were able to show that the verdicts in such cases had been given against the weight of evidence he thought the government were not entitled to ask for the very sweeping provisions contained in the present clause did anybody doubt for a single instant that if the murderers of lord frederick cavendish and mr burke were fairly detected and brought before a jury for trial on reasonable evidence there would be a failure to convict he feared very much that the effect of the proceedings which would be taken under this clause would be bill further to estrange the sympathies of the irish people from the efforts which were being made for the vindication of the law in ireland mr parnell said he never conveyed in the slightest degree that there should be any amnesty for the perpetrators of the more serious offences mentioned in the sub section of the clause and he certainly thought the home secretary was not entitled to draw the deductions he appeared to have done he never suggested there should be any amnesty for murders for manslaughters for attempts to kill for aggravated assaults or for arson but what he said was that they were fairly entitled to ask that inasmuch as trial by jury was to be abolished in respect to such serious offences the clause should not be retrospective in its action what he had wished to convey and what he would respectfully press again on the government was that as regarded the retrospective action at all events some distinction should be drawn between the more serious offences scheduled in the clause and the lighter ones in subsection f an attack upon a dwelling house was mentioned as one of the offences which were to be referred to the new tribunal now an offence of that kind might be very serious or very light where an attack on a dwelling was collusive as it frequently had been in the course of the land movement in many in fact in the majority of cases the attacks on houses had taken place at the request of the tenants themselves in order that they might have some excuse for going to their landlords the next day and ask for an abatement they might fairly draw some distinction between such attacks on houses and attacks on houses involving danger to life and property he desired to ask whether the government could not see their way to draw some distinction as regarded the retrospective character of the bill between those two classes of offences offences involving danger to life and property or offences in which there was actual harm done to life person or property and offences connected with the land movement which though legally and technically serious and grave would not under the english law be punishable by more than three months imprisonment mr parnell said he would now move the amendment which stood in the name of the hon member for dungarvan mr o'donnell it was in page line after offences to insert where such offences are agrarian offences it was admitted by everybody that justice had only failed in ireland in the case of agrarian offences the bill was admittedly brought in to deal with agrarian offences and therefore there was no reason why the bill should not be limited to such crimes he could not see what possible objection the government could urge against the amendment amendment proposed in page line after offences insert where such offences are agrarian offences mr parnell question proposed that those words be there inserted mr parnell said he thought it was sufficient to have brought the amendment under the notice of the committee and therefore he would ask to withdraw it amendment by leave withdrawn mr parnell said the question involved in the amendment of his hon and gallant friend was one of the greatest importances sic it was however also embodied in the various amendments standing on the paper in the names of several hon members and that being so he thought it might in all probability be more satisfactorily presented to the committee upon the amendment standing in the name of the hon and learned member for christ church mr horace davey of course it must be considered further on whether any words of the kind moved by the hon and gallant member opposite ought not to be inserted but in the meantime he would suggest the withdrawal of the amendment before the committee and he put it to his hon and gallant friend whether in view of the great importance of the question and the fact that an english member had so far interested himself as to put down an amendment on the subject it would not be a matter of courtesy to that gentleman to leave the matter in his hands mr parnell said that if the right hon and learned gentleman was to be allowed to interpolate a speech with regard to what had been said by a third person in the middle of the speech of the hon member mr thorold rogers there were some other hon members who would desire the same privilege the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland who had been dumb the whole evening would have an opportunity of addressing the committee when the hon member who was now in possession of it had concluded mr buxton said the hon member for the city of cork in the speech delivered at waterford on the 6th of december referred to that house and said they cannot suspend the habeas corpus act without an act of parliament and they cannot pass coercion without an act of parliament and so long as we are able to stand in parliament i will undertake to say they will pass neither the one or the other and i am sure that these forces are amply sufficient for the task which we all have before us the task of breaking the neck of english misgovernment in ireland and chasing from the country the usurpation which has long hung round our necks he would read one more quotation it was from a speech delivered by the hon member at cincinnati on the 23rd of february when the hon member for the city of cork had the atlantic between england and himself he said let us not forget that this is the ultimate goal at which all we irishmen aim none of us whether we are in america or in ireland or wherever we may be will be satisfied until we have destroyed the last link which keeps ireland bound to england mr parnell may i ask where the speech was delivered and from what report the hon gentleman is quoting mr buxton the speech was delivered in cincinnati in the month of february mr parnell from what newspaper is the hon member quoting mr buxton i cannot inform the hon member mr parnell will the hon member be kind enough to say what is his authority for the quotation mr buxton said he had not made the quotation from any newspaper but from a report of the speech in a book called the truth about the land league if the hon gentleman would tell him he did not make such remarks he would be perfectly satisfied he could not help thinking there was at least a tendency in those quotations towards some such crime as was defined in the and vict they might in future see a recurrence of such speeches and it was necessary they should have the means of putting a stop to them in the belief that they would have such means by the bill he should give his hearty support to the government mr parnell the facts referred to are not connected with cases of treason or treason felony mr parnell said he was unwilling to ask the government to give further time for the consideration of this amendment for he knew there were many hon members who had remained in order to vote for the amendment and possibly it might not be convenient for them to come down again to morrow for a division but he was so much impressed with the importance of the question whether this sub section was to stand in the bill or not that he felt bound to ask the government to take further time if only to the extent of one night for the consideration of this matter he did not suppose that anything he could urge to morrow would be of much importance and it would be useless for him to suppose that he could urge anything to change the fixed determination of the government but speaking with considerable knowledge of the state of affairs in ireland and with a full sense of the gravity of the position he was bound to say that so far as he could see the retention of this sub section in the bill would make political or constitutional action of any kind in ireland impossible he had been obliged to risk a good deal for the sake of carrying out what he believed to be the desire of the vast and overwhelming majority of the people peace and order ought to be restored in ireland but the constitutional liberties of the people ought to be preserved during the past six months he had gained considerable insight as to the opinion of irishmen at home a much greater insight than he had ever had before and he believed it was the duty of any political leader to march abreast of his people and those he had to lead and not in advance of them and he was convinced that if the prime minister had continued to pursue the true policy of conciliation which he had adopted he would have found himself supported and assisted by the vast majority of the irish people he would ask the right hon gentleman to allow one more night he would urge him before he burnt his boats and broke down his bridges to give them one night for the further consideration of this matter he mr parnell begged to move that the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again motion made and question proposed that the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again mr parnell mr parnell said he was sure he had no more desire than had the right hon gentleman to enter into any contest with regard to motions to report progress or for adjournment in moving to report progress he had been simply animated by the enormous importance of the question the right hon gentleman must not imagine that time would be lost if he mr parnell and his friends had an opportunity of consulting together they had not anticipated that the government would have insisted on going on any further with the committee to night especially when no member of the government had attempted to justify the inclusion of the sub section in the bill by showing that there had been a break down in the jury system in any trial for treason or treason felony during the whole of the history of ireland since the union the crown had always been able to obtain convictions for treason or treason felony and his hon friends and himself felt that their position under the operation of the clause would be such that if they attended open air meetings no matter how innocent their reasons or intentions they would be liable to charges of treason or treason felony to be tried by judges turned into jurors by men who had always been ranged against them in political strife someone had said that the right hon gentleman the prime minister himself might be charged with treason by some hon members on that the conservative side of the house and the question had been asked under those circumstances what would be the right hon gentleman position if he went over to ireland no doubt his position would be perfectly safe because the public opinion of great britain or a section of it be it the majority or the minority would from time to time prevent any abuse of the law against him but that would not be so with the irish members they in ireland had no public opinion to depend on except the public opinion of the people of ireland and they knew that such public opinion would be powerless to protect them they knew how easy it was for any skilful politician to enlist the weight of public opinion in england against any irish politician they felt then very strongly indeed that this was not a power which ought in any way to be given to the crown this power of being both judge and jury in political cases least of all should it be given in a country like ireland which was so exceptionally situated as to the means it had for making its public opinion felt the right hon gentleman had said postpone what you have to say until the report but experience had shown him that unless they could make some considerable impression on the government in committee in regard to a question of this kind there was very little use in hoping for further action on the report in the absence of any hope held out to them by the right hon gentleman that the ears and the minds of the government were still open to their arguments they could not he feared put off the consideration of this matter until the report when they would have no hope of discussion ending in any beneficial result question put and negatived original question again proposed\n",

      "mr parnell said that the decision of the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary was satisfactory as far as it went but he regretted very much that the right hon and learned gentleman did not feel it his duty to go further and to state to the committee that he was prepared to give up the sub section altogether he did not imagine that the government wished to proceed in any vindictive spirit in regard to past offences but it must be borne in mind that various members of that house might have spoken in ireland in the course of the agitation which had been carried on during the last few years and he certainly thought the concession went a very little way in removing the objections which were entertained to the sub section as it stood in the bill the offences of treason and treason felony were highly constructive and unless a person carried a legal guide in his pocket it would be almost impossible to be perfectly sure that on every occasion he was avoiding the meshes of the statute relating to these offences he wished to point out to the committee that there had been an entire absence of any attempt on the part of the government or on the part of any speaker in support of this sub section to justify it in any way whatever he had asked the right hon and learned attorney general for ireland yesterday whether he could mention any instance in which a jury had not been able to decide according to the weight of evidence in any trial for murder in ireland during the last two years and the right hon and learned gentleman had not taken up the challenge he would now again ask the right hon and learned gentleman if he could recollect any instance in the whole criminal jurisprudence of ireland during the last century in which a jury had failed to decide in accordance with the weight of evidence in a trial for treason or treason felony he was willing to allow the right hon and learned gentleman to go back for years and he would challenge him to produce a single instance in which an irish jury had ever failed to decide against the weight of evidence in the case of a person accused of treason or treason felony a good many instances might be cited in which men had been convicted of these offences if they took the rebellion of if they took the abortive rebellion of or robert emmett ill starred attempt in or the attempts that were made in and it would be found that in all those rebellious movements scores and scores of persons were convicted by irish juries on charges of treason and treason felony they were therefore entitled to have some sort of ground and foundation for the claim of the government that these offences should be placed outside the ordinary constitution it had unfortunately been the habit of the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary in the discussions upon this clause to endeavour to impute to everybody who wished to except a certain offence from the provisions of the section sympathy with the offence sought to be excepted but he mr parnell wished to point out that up to the present time it had always been considered that accused persons were innocent until they were proved to be guilty and when hon members desired to observe the ordinary constitutional safeguards and the ordinary forms of law provided for accused persons in ireland even in the case of persons accused of treason and treason felony it was very hard they should be charged with sympathy with those crimes and accused of acting in the interests of murderers and treasonable persons he would himself answer the question he had addressed to the right hon and learned attorney general for ireland there had been one exception during the whole course of the last years in which an irish jury failed to decide according to the weight of evidence he referred to the trial of sir charles gavan duffy in on the charge of high treason sir charles gavan duffy was tried twice for his life and he was saved on each occasion he mr parnell would not say from death but certainly from penal servitude by one or two of the jury having held out against the majority but what would have been the fate of sir charles gavan duffy under this bill it must be borne in mind that sir charles had since been knighted by the queen that he had become premier of victoria and speaker of the legislative assembly there what would have been his fate if tried by a special commission under this clause beyond doubt he would have been sentenced to death and although that death sentence would probably have been commuted to penal servitude for life sir charles would at all events have been degraded and a gentleman who had since proved himself a most brilliant statesman and a distinguished ornament to the literature of this country and of the colonies would have been disgraced it was a remarkable fact that political prisoners in this country were treated like ordinary criminals there was no special treatment for persons convicted of political offences but they were treated as degraded felons and as if they had been guilty of crimes of the most atrocious and abominable character the committee had been reminded over and over again of what took place at portland and dartmouth and they appeared to be forgetful of all those feelings of humanity which animated the prime minister when he interfered on behalf of the neapolitan prisoners he mr parnell and those who thought with him claimed on this ground also that the safeguards of the constitution should not be removed and that political prisoners in ireland with such a dreadful fate before them as that involved in penal servitude should not be deprived of the constitutional guarantees promised to them when the act regarding treason and treason felony was passed when that act was placed before parliament it was introduced by sir john romilly and its object was to alter the character of treason to a considerable extent and to do away with the death punishment it was expressly defended by sir john romilly on the ground that the accused person would always have the constitutional safeguard of trial by jury that declaration was made in the year when the times were tenfold more troublesome in ireland than they were now and when outrages and murders of every description were threefold as numerous sir john romilly in bringing in the crown and government security bill said the mode in which persons are to express their intention of committing these crimes is either by printing writing or by open and advised speaking no speaking can fall within the penalty of these statutes unless it be such as is used for the purpose of levying war by force to compel the queen or this house to take certain measures without which force they would not be disposed to adopt them you must also have a jury of twelve men who shall be of opinion that the speaking has been of such a nature as is calculated for the purpose of levying such war the act limits the nature of the evidence to be given and requires the evidence of certain overt acts to be given such as printing writing and open and advised speaking it has been frequently observed that speaking is liable to much misrepresentation and that you have frequently words reported not supposed to have been spoken in those cases the difficulty of proof will form a safeguard for the accused and the party as i said before must be tried by a common jury he will have the benefit of that jury and i have always heard it said that it was part of our constitution to have confidence in the verdict of a jury and i do not think you will get juries to convict unless they are convinced that the open and advised speaking was of such a nature as that pointed out by the statute hansard's xcviii in that passage there was evidently an admission on the part of the solicitor general for england which position sir john romilly then occupied that he would not he sic justified in asking the assent of the house of commons to the bill in reference to treason felony unless it was provided that the person accused should have the benefit of a jury sir john romilly did not foresee that the time would arrive when in a much more tranquil state of society all the constitutional guarantees for the life and liberty of the subject would be suspended in ireland and advantage would be taken of such acts as this to put men in danger of their liberty for offences of this character it had been said that it was very difficult to prove high treason as regarded public speaking the question was what constituted high treason mr justice stephen laid down that almost every political riot was high treason so that if at a meeting in ireland a riot took place between the police and the people as happened in dublin just before the arrests last october the judges would be entitled to hold that it was an act of high treason and that all persons accused of participating in it could be tried under this provision the government would be further entitled to hold that words spoken at a public meeting on such an occasion however innocently they were spoken were intended to be an incitement to riot and levying war against the crown it had been said by the home secretary that what he wanted to reach was treasonable societies that were worked by means of murder and outrage if the right hon and learned gentleman wished to reach treasonable societies that were worked by means of murder and outrage he had a way open to him in the subsequent sections of this bill which applied to murder if there were treasonable societies in existence in ireland which were worked by means of murder and outrage those societies were not only treasonable societies but they were murderous societies and under the law of murder which according to the statement of the home secretary yesterday was a judge made law and not a mere constructive law they could be dealt with the law regarding treason and treason felony rested upon statute law the government had perfect liberty to indict persons belonging to such societies if it could be shown that they had knowledge of such murderous intentions on the part of any member of such societies and the judges would hang them upon conviction they did not require he might almost say to sanctify murder by identifying it they had a remedy straight and direct that remedy was by proceeding against the offence itself which they said they desired to reach they had every opportunity of punishing murder and outrage under a subsequent subsection of the bill without mixing political offences up with the matter at all he hoped it was not yet too late to influence if possible the mind of the government in regard to this matter he believed as he had said last night that they had a favourable opportunity in ireland at the present moment for restoring law and order if they did not proceed in a vindictive fashion if they sought to proceed in a vindictive fashion and to take away all the rights of the irish people he feared that their measure of conciliation which was to follow would prove a failure they made a great mistake last session in carrying a coercion bill before proceeding with their remedial measure he was convinced that if they had proceeded at the commencement of last session to carry their land act it would have met with a different reception and would have had a very much better trial at the hands of the irish people in the same way he believed now that very much of the good effect of the arrears bill would be lost if the government insisted on proceeding with this vindictive coercion bill the irish people were a very susceptible people they were very quick to recognize any reliance on their honour and their good feeling and if the english government relied more on the honour and good feeling of the irish people than they were in the habit of doing they would find their task of governing ireland very much easier than it had been they had unfortunately relied too much on their brute strength they had used that brute strength from year to year and from century to century and where had it left them it had left them in a state which according to the prime minister had never been equalled in intensity in ireland was it not time then to turn over a new leaf and reverse the evil traditions of the past to trust more to the power of affection to the feeling that justice was being administered and that generosity was being extended to ireland if the government had the strength to try this course they would find that they would not be disappointed they were now in including in the bill such provisions as this provisions directed against political offences arising out of open and advised speaking depriving the constitutional politician in ireland of every kind of locus standi between the secret societies on the one side and the government on the other it would be impossible for any constitutional politician to exist and he thought that the feeling of the irish members knowing as they did the state of affairs in that country and desirous as they were of truthfully representing it to the house of commons in this very grave and important crisis he thought their feeling should have some regard paid to it and when a point had been urged so strongly as they felt it their duty to urge this point the government should consider whether they could not give way to the overwhelming sentiment which had been expressed mr parnell said that in the absence of his hon friend the member for tipperary mr dillon he wished to move a portion of the amendment which stood in the name of his hon friend his hon friend proposed to leave out the sub sections b c d and e which specified among the offences to be tried b murder or manslaughter c attempts to kill d aggravated crimes of violence against the person e arson whether by common law or by statute he mr parnell would not move the whole of this amendment but would propose simply to leave out from sub section b the words murder or he did this on the ground which had been frequently stated in the course of the discussion in committee that there had been no failure on the part of juries to convict during the last two years where the weight of evidence required them to convict he again respectfully asked the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland to state whether in his opinion as one of the law officers of the crown there had been any failure of justice with regard to juries in the cases of murder tried during the year in each of which it was no doubt true that the persons accused were acquitted personally he was not aware that any charge had been brought against the juries upon these occasions of having acted contrary to the evidence and if the government could not make out a satisfactory case or a more satisfactory case than had been made out in regard to sub section a he should certainly feel himself compelled to put the committee to the trouble of a division amendment proposed in page line to leave out the words murder or mr parnell question proposed that the words murder or stand part of the clause mr parnell asked if the cases referred to were murder cases mr parnell asked what the case was mr parnell said that a threatening notice was not murder mr parnell said he had put a question to the right hon and learned attorney general for ireland in the hope that he might have been saved the necessity of putting the committee to the trouble of a division he had asked the right hon and learned gentleman if he could give the committee any instance during the two years of the agitation of the land league coincident with the right hon and learned gentleman tenure of office in which in his opinion a jury had given a verdict against the weight of evidence in a case of murder the right hon and learned gentleman said there was one occasion on which this had occurred but the right hon and learned gentleman did not think it proper to inform the house what that case was he mr parnell was therefore not able to identify it or examine the basis of the right hon and learned gentleman conclusions at the same time he had no doubt that the right hon and learned gentleman had acted with proper regard to his duty in not stating the evidence to the house now he mr parnell had followed the list of cases sent to trial for murder and had read the evidence attentively and his impression was that in no case in which persons were made amenable to the law since the land movement came into operation had there been a failure on the part of the jury to convict where proper and suitable evidence had been given the right hon and learned gentleman attempted to controvert his mr parnell's views by referring him to what he called a long list of failures on the part of juries to convict which was contained in the evidence given by mr bolton the crown solicitor for the county of tipperary before the lords committee of last year when he mr parnell asked the right hon and learned gentleman if these were cases of murder the right hon and learned gentleman said yes with a great deal of emphasis now he mr parnell had had an opportunity of going over all these cases since the right hon and learned gentleman had alluded to them and he found in mr bolton long list of cases that there were only three of murder extending over the period from to the attorney general for ireland mr w m johnson said he had not referred to those dates all he had referred to was the number of cases which had occurred between and the present date mr parnell said he had misunderstood the right hon and learned gentleman and it was possible he might have made a mistake as he had not had an opportunity of examining the evidence of mr bolton as carefully as the right hon and learned gentleman had he therefore accepted the right hon and learned gentleman correction of the dates but at all events the figures he had referred to included the period of the years from to with the result he had already mentioned these dates would not include the period which he was dealing with of the land league agitation he must remind the right hon and learned gentleman that the late government were in office during most of that period but they never thought it necessary to base upon that failure of juries to convict a demand for the abolition of trial by jury in murder cases the right hon and learned gentleman had only given one instance of failure to convict in a case of murder to justify the government in the proposals they now made he wished to show the sort of evidence that was given before the committee of the house of lords in substantiation of the charge made against juries in the county of tipperary of refusing to convict that was one of the cases of murder to which he thought the right hon and learned gentleman referred it would be found mentioned in question of the evidence before the lords committee the charge preferred was that of firing at a man with intent to kill the firearm used was a pistol the pistol was loaded when found on the person of the man who was accused of the offence it was loaded with what were called slugs cut from a piece of sheet lead and in the house of the accused person a piece of lead of the same description was discovered but anyone who knew anything of sheet lead knew that it was always the same in the particular case mentioned by the right hon and learned gentleman on the charge being drawn from the pistol the wadding was found to consist of a piece of the dublin evening mail a newspaper which persons were in the habit of borrowing from a magistrate who lived in the neighbourhood and in the pocket of the person charged with the offence a piece of the same newspaper was found the contention raised by the right hon and learned gentleman was that because a person had in his possession a piece of the dublin mail newspaper and because a certain firearm was found to have been loaded with a piece of the same newspaper therefore a jury of the county of tipperary failed to do their duty in acquitting the accused upon this extremely doubtful circumstantial evidence he must say that the right hon and learned gentleman had not made out a case he had only been able to give the committee one instance of the failure of a jury to convict in a case of murder the same remark would apply to the three other instances which were given on the testimony of mr bolton under these circumstances with very great reluctance he should feel obliged to take the sense of the committee upon the amendment mr parnell remarked that the arguments had been confined to cases of murder mr parnell said he had not desired to continue the discussion and if it had not been for the appearance of the hon member for kirkcaldy sir george campbell in the arena the committee would probably have been going through the division at that moment the speech of the hon member exemplified the waste of time he deprecated and which so frequently arose in that house in consequence of certain hon members who were in the habit of remaining out of the house when an amendment was under discussion coming in at the very close of the discussion and giving their opinions upon the matter without having heard the reasons why the amendment had been brought forward he did not propose to state all the reasons which had induced him to make this proposition and in refusing to do so he hoped the hon member would acquit him of any desire to be discourteous he thought however that before the hon gentleman came into the house he mr parnell had made out a very strong case a very convincing case and a case which had not been answered in the slightest degree by any member of the government against this portion of this particular sub section he thought they had made out an equally strong case with regard to convictions for murder as they had with regard to convictions for treason mr parnell said that hitherto the government had rested their case on the ground that the juries disagreed not that they acquitted against the weight of evidence the statement that juries acquitted against the weight of evidence was now made for the first time in the discussions on the bill in regard to the irish jury question the right hon and learned gentleman in order to prove the statement which he now made for the first time assumed for the sake of argument that in certain cases of arson in ireland juries had acquitted prisoners against the weight of evidence this was the sort of case that ministers of the crown brought before the committee for the purpose of inducing them to grant this extraordinary and unconstitutional enactment this was the kind of argument upon which they were asked to give up all their rights and liberties upon which they were asked to place their very lives in the hands of the lord lieutenant of ireland he must say he had expected that they would have had some facts some figures some statistics brought before them to bear out the claim of the government not that they would have had such an extraordinary statement as this from the right hon and taught gentleman the home secretary mr parnell said he regretted that the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary had not seen his way to accept the very reasonable amendment of his hon friend the change of venue inflicted enormous hardship both on prisoners and witnesses he had himself seen a great deal of this at the assizes last winter crowds of witnesses were brought to the various towns in which the assizes were held they were kept from their homes for weeks and a very scanty allowance was made for their expenses in some cases no allowance at all it was under any circumstances a great hardship to take persons away from their own districts and ought to be avoided if possible as to the proposed arrangement providing against the intimidation of witnesses the argument was absurd because if they were to be intimidated they could be intimidated just as well when they reached home again from the place where their evidence was given as they could be when they gave their evidence on the spot this was a very important amendment and irish members would have to insist upon it very strongly and as that could not be done satisfactorily at that hour of the night he begged to move that progress be reported motion made and question proposed that the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again mr parnell\n",

      "mr parnell asked what rule the government proposed to adopt in such a case in reference to the payment of witnesses would the same rules with regard to the payment of the expenses of witnesses be adopted as those which were adopted in the case of an ordinary winter assize mr parnell said he wished to draw the attention of the committee to the manner in which the rules had worked in the case of the last winter assizes at cork and the committee would then be able to judge what it was they were now asked to sanction under this clause the bill gave power to try persons for certain offences in an exceptional manner the poor people who might be accused were either innocent or they were not of course the law presumed that every man was innocent until he was proved guilty these poor people might be taken out of their own county and with their witnesses compelled to attend in some distant part of ireland and what was now asked was that that course should not be taken but that they should be tried in their own county he was surprised that the government did not agree to the very reasonable amendment which had been proposed if the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary refused to give in upon so very small a matter he could not see what hope there was for hon members who sought to amend the bill in more important particulars the course now taken certainly presaged very badly for any material alteration of the bill seeing that the home secretary refused to give way on so small a point he wished to call the attention of the committee to the experience which was gained in reference to the winter assizes act at the last munster winter assizes and indeed at all of the winter assizes in ireland in doing so he wished to state his own opinion that last winter that act was grossly abused by the crown prosecutor it was used for purposes for which it was never intended it was originally intended to be a merciful act an act for a general gaol delivery the act itself was passed by sir colman o'loghlen a lawyer of considerable experience and a most humane man who brought it in for the purpose of preventing the unnecessary detention of prisoners in gaol for an indefinite period but the act had been used by the crown in ireland not for a gaol delivery but for the purpose of getting rid of bail cases and particularly for the purpose of bringing about a change of venue that power they now sought to deprive the government of in reference to this bill what took place at the munster assizes scores of persons were brought into cork from all parts of munster they were detained in cork gaol for weeks and for months away from their friends and they were consequently deprived of the merciful provisions of the 13th section of the prisons act of which the right hon gentleman the member for south west lancashire sir r assheton cross would very well recollect prisoners awaiting trial were to be treated differently from convicted prisoners and were to be allowed to feed themselves but one of the consequences of the working of this winter assizes act was that these persons were taken away to a distance from their homes and from their friends and therefore it became impossible to feed them and they were compelled to live upon prison fare and not only that but all the witnesses who were necessary for the defence were left for weeks in the city of cork without any support from the crown these people these poor humble witnesses were obliged to pay their own fare from different portions of the province of munster they were not only obliged to do that but they were also obliged to pay for their own sustenance when they arrived in cork and they were not even informed by the crown at what period or at what approximate period it was likely their case would be brought on some witnesses were kept in the city of cork previous to christmas day after day and week after week at their own expense without the crown being willing to grant them one farthing in point of fact the crown absolutely refused to grant them 1s towards their support nothing whatever was paid by the crown until christmas the state of affairs then became too hot for the right hon and learned gentleman the member for mallow mr w m johnson they had been kept there without any sustenance from the crown and the crown solicitor then sent to tell them they would not be wanted although he had previously been repeatedly applied to to sic know whether the case in which they were interested would be brought on before or after christmas the consequence was that many of these poor people having waited in cork up to christmas were then obliged on the adjournment of the assizes to go home many of them to a distance of or miles at their own expense and to return again at their own expense to the adjourned assizes after christmas he knew also that many of the witnesses were contemplating going into the workhouse and applying to the union for relief because they had been refused support from the crown now if this portion of the act and this power with regard to changes of venue were to be worked in the same way as the winter assizes act was worked all he could say was that it would inflict the grossest cruelty and hardship upon persons who might be tried before this tribunal and their witnesses he could not imagine why the government should seek to retain this power in the bill it was not likely they would ever find it necessary to use it why should they retain a power which could only be used for the purpose of inflicting injustice upon untried prisoners men who were innocent in the eyes of the law and make it difficult for such prisoners to make proper arrangements for their defence mr parnell remarked that the right hon and learned gentleman had entirely begged the question no objection was raised to the ordinary law as it stood the ordinary law required an affidavit to be made before the judge before whom the case was sent for trial but in this case it was left entirely to the lord lieutenant to decide whether the commission should be issued in the first instance in the locality or county to which the prisoner belonged or whether it should be issued in some entirely different county now that was altogether a different case let the commission be issued and if there were any prisoners to be tried by the commission then let the application be made in the ordinary way and if it were considered a fair application the judges themselves would change the venue but here the government sought to do an entirely different thing they asked that power should be given to the lord lieutenant to direct that a commission should be issued wherever his excellency pleased for the trial of a prisoner no matter what part of the country he belonged to and it was only natural to suppose that the lord lieutenant would be very much guided by the convenience of the official class of ireland who were to take part in the trial he could well understand in the case of a commission being issued for the county of mayo that the lord lieutenant might consider it more convenient for the officers connected with the law to hold the commission nearer dublin in the absence of any good hotel in mayo and the general discomfort which would unfortunately exist in that poverty stricken county it was only natural that everybody connected with the administration of the law should desire that they should not be taken down to westport or castlebar for the purpose of sitting upon a commission for the trial of these offences if the right hon and learned gentleman would leave it as he stated just now to the judges themselves assembled on the commission to decide whether the venue in particular cases should be changed or not he mr parnell would have no objection in the world but he did object to give this summary power to an official class in the dublin office of the lord lieutenant believing that it was a power that was liable to the most extreme abuse if the power were given at all it was a power that certainly would be abused and he could foresee the immense hardship that would be inflicted upon a large number of poor and humble persons who might not be in a position to advance the expenses that would be necessary for their witnesses the right hon and learned gentleman had not ventured to say that the money would be advanced beforehand on the contrary he said that a case would have to be made out to the satisfaction of the judges that all these persons were necessary as witnesses but all the expenditure would have to be incurred in the first instance and in what position would a poor person be to defray it what he contended for in this case was that the decision in regard to the change of venue should be practically in the hands of the judge and not left to the arbitrary will of the lord lieutenant mr parnell said he thought the statement of the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary was a very fair one and he was quite ready to accept it if there had hitherto been any provision to secure the payment of the expenses of witnesses required for the defence of a prisoner it had certainly not been carried out and it was only from the personal knowledge they possessed of the real facts of the case that the irish members had felt it their duty to press the matter strongly upon the attention of the government he hoped that the right hon and learned gentleman would put his clauses upon the paper a few days before they would come on for discussion mr parnell said that there was an amendment on the paper in the name of the hon member for the city of dublin dr lyons which would come before that of the hon and learned member for bridport mr warton and which in the absence of the hon gentleman he mr parnell wished to move the amendment raised a very important question and he hoped he would have an opportunity of bringing it before the committee mr parnell said the previous amendment having been withdrawn he wished to move the amendment standing in the name of the hon member for the city of dublin dr lyons which raised a very important question it raised in fact the principle of the clause and he thought it would be convenient if a discussion were taken on that amendment on the question as to whether the committee would sanction the abrogation of trial by jury in ireland without having first ascertained whether they could not by means of special juries obtain convictions the special jury system was well known the persons on the panel of special juries were gentlemen of considerable fortune and position and entirely above the motives which it had been said influenced the minds of persons composing the common jury mr parnell said he was inclined to think that the suggestion of the home secretary was a reasonable one that the discussion with regard to having a special jury should be taken on the question that the clause stand part of the bill and would therefore not move the amendment indicated mr parnell said he thought the objection of the hon member for wexford mr healy would be met if the right hon and learned gentleman would consent to leave out of his amendment the words at any place beyond the limits of the county in which he was committed for trial there were undoubtedly counties in ireland like cork in which a man would have a considerable distance to travel in order to reach his home after being tried and acquitted within the county it seemed to him only just that a man acquitted under this act should not be exposed to any hardship on the ground of expense mr parnell asked whether it was worth while to make any exception at all it would be better to extend the principle to all the offences in the clause mr parnell suggested to the hon member mr thompson that if the home secretary would agree to reconsider this matter on report the matter might be left with confidence to the right hon and learned gentleman mr parnell said he did not believe the home secretary intended this amendment to be moved because during the discussion on the amendment with regard to prisoners being tried in the districts where the offences were committed he had intimated his intention to bring up a clause later on dealing with the machinery for providing the expenses of witnesses this amendment certainly did not provide for expenses in the spirit of the statement of the right hon and learned gentleman because it was expressly said there should be some provision for the maintenance of witnesses and for enabling a poor prisoner to get his expenses before he came up for trial under the bill the witnesses might have to remain for some weeks in an assize town or wherever the commission was held at their own expense and it was only reasonable that after the money had been advanced out of the slender resources of the prisoner the court should certify for costs he would suggest that this matter should be left open for consideration and that the home secretary having considered the question should bring up his clause or clauses for effecting what he evidently thought it was desirable to carry out mr parnell said it was a remarkable fact that whenever there was any dirt or abuse to be cast upon irishmen an irishman was always found ready to do it with greater zest and greater zeal than any other man he could recollect the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin mr plunket heaping abuse in the house upon a distinguished and honourable irishman he remembered when he justified his right to vote against the admission of the late mr john mitchel as member for the county of tipperary on the ground that ho sic was a dishonourable felon no englishman or scotchman made such an allegation as that in the course of the debate but it was reserved for an irishman the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin to attempt to heap dishonour upon a man as honourable as himself the right hon and learned gentleman looked forward with the highest expectation to the passing of this bill into law and supposed that when it was passed ho sic and his class would have everything in ireland under their thumb that they would be able to take up an attitude of hostility to the just claims of the irish tenant farmers that was what was really involved in this question that was what was really involved in all these demands for coercion which first of all commenced upon the opposition bench and then were taken up by the metropolitan press and forced on the liberal ministry the conservatives knew that upon this extraordinary power these unfair advantages these unjust laws depended their power to claim unjust and exorbitant rents from the irish tenantry during the last winter the land act had been helped in many cases by the landlords who made settlements out of court and he believed the number of those settlements out of court was about equal to the number of decrees or the number of judicial rents fixed by the court and admittedly upon those settlements out of court which were arrived at by mutual arrangement between landlord and tenant must depend the future success of the land act if those settlements were put a stop to the prospect of which the prime minister spoke the other day that or judicial rents would have been fixed by the end of this year if those mutual arrangements were stopped the landlords would be thrown back on what they believed to be their distinct rights and which according to their view had been unjustly assailed by the land act and so would be put an end to this process of mutual arrangement which had been going on for the last six months to the extent of settlements out of court it would also stop the arrangements which had been largely made for temporary abatements pending decisions by the land commissioners and there was not the slightest doubt that the great joy with which the class represented by the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin hailed this measure of coercion was due to the fact that they believed they would be able to exact during the coming autumn and winter their full pound of flesh without reduction or abatement he mr parnell could not help sympathizing with the chief secretary upon the speech he had delivered that evening for the right hon gentleman seemed to him to wish that he could have had some other task as one of his duties in taking up the high and important and responsible office which he had to fill than the impossible task of defending coercion and as the right hon gentleman trotted out all the well worn and stale arguments which so many of his predecessors had produced only to find them utterly falsified by the results he could not help sympathizing with the chief secretary in the really disagreeable and odious task which he was sure the right hon gentleman felt his present task to be the right hon gentleman gave some examples of evidence extracted from blue books to justify the claims of the government for the suspension of trial by jury but when he asked for dates the right hon gentleman was unable to give them mr trevelyan i do not wish to interrupt the hon member but the real fact is that i have discovered the dates the first case i gave was in and the three other instances were at the summer assizes in mr parnell said he was willing to give the right hon gentleman all the credit which his argument might gain from the discovery of the dates but that did not amount to much because his heart could not have been much in his work since he had not thought it necessary to take the trouble to obtain the full information with regard to these offences which he had brought before the committee this was a curious and instructive circumstance the right hon gentleman was heir to the mistakes of his predecessors and he was obliged to take up the task of governing ireland where ho sic found it he mr parnell could not see how the chief secretary could hope for any greater success than his predecessors had achieved he had now to try a still worse and still more severe coercion bill than the one which would expire next september he was about to try a measure which would make the enforcement of law and order still more he did not wish to say repugnant to irishmen but depend upon it the more the government introduced measures of this kind the more indifferent the people would feel as to the detection of crime the hon member for the county of tipperary had said the other evening that the irish people sympathized with crime mr dillon i said that doubtless there existed some sympathy with crime in ireland mr parnell accepted the correction but he thought that was scarcely the correct way to describe the situation in ireland it was rather that the law had been so unfairly used that it had been so obviously twisted and diverted that the irish people were indifferent as regarded the detection of crime and the enforcement of the law it was because all the exertions of parliament had been directed to devising some further method of enforcing the agrarian rights of the landlords some more stringent law something entirely different from the laws that ought to bind great britain and ireland together that the people of ireland had taken up this attitude not of sympathy with crime but of saying when an outrage was committed well the law has never helped us and we will now leave the law to help itself just immediately after the horrible murder in phoenix park there seemed a change in the feeling there was a change in the feeling all over the world and the people of ireland undoubtedly ranged themselves on the side of law and order and desired to detect the phoenix park murderers that feeling spread to america and money was subscribed in that country thousands of dollars were subscribed in a few days for the purpose of offering rewards for the detection of the murderers but immediately after the government introduced this coercion bill that feeling at once stopped that was one of the first results of coercion what was one of the next results in the month during which there was a hope that the government were about to change their policy agrarian outrages diminished by some or in the fortnight following the introduction of this bill that diminution ceased according to the chief secretary statement he did not know whether that diminution had been maintained or was still checked but it was the simple fact that in the month of april the more serious classes of agrarian outrages showed a very remarkable diminution he believed it would be seen that in the last month although that diminution had been increased it had yet been maintained and that there was still an absence of the more serious forms of crime had it not been for the introduction of this coercion bill and the feeling of exasperation which it had aroused in ireland there would have been a still more marked diminution of agrarian crime and especially in that of a more serious character the chief secretary had told the committee of the great increase in the number of outrages during the first four months of this year as compared with the first four months of last year he had stated that they had nearly doubled in number but he did not state that the evictions had been quadrupled there was a remarkable relation between the proportion of outrages and of evictions it was said by some hon member the other day in the house that the agrarian crime had not been largest where there had been the greatest number of evictions and that was undoubtedly true but agrarian crime did not necessarily follow eviction on the contrary crime more often preceded eviction agrarian crime in ireland was not apparently undertaken by evicted people because they had no means of undertaking it they were thrown on to the roadside and into the workhouses and were starved agrarian crime seemed to be undertaken by people in order to prevent evictions and to deter landlords from evicting evictions might and had come all the same but undoubtedly in some of the districts where agrarian crime had been most excessive evictions had been least numerous and what sort of a lesson was it that the government wished to teach irish people that to avoid eviction they must commit outrage that was the lesson taught by making this coercion bill precede the arrears bill if the government had proceeded with the arrears bill and given the tenant farmers some hope that they would be able to maintain the roofs over their heads until they could get the value of the beneficial act of last session they would have done more to stop agrarian crime and to help the large majority of people who desired the restoration of law and order than all the coercion bills could do the right hon gentleman said that general challenges had been made in that house by some of the irish members for a statement as to in what respect juries had failed in their verdicts they gave no general challenge but only in regard to cases of treason and treason felony they admitted that in some cases juries had failed to return verdicts in accordance with the weight of evidence but in regard to the more serious crimes they challenged the government to produce specific cases of failure and their challenge remained unanswered to that day the attorney general had not been able to give a single instance he mentioned one instance of murder which however he did not believe was of an agrarian character although he was asked to give agrarian cases he was so utterly unable to give an instance of murder in which a jury had failed to return a verdict in accordance with the weight of evidence that he was obliged to seek another case of murder which was not agrarian and which was not of the kind it was proposed to try under this act the irish members did not consider that the evidence given before the house of lords committee could be relied upon that committee was appointed with the object of discrediting the irish jury system but it failed to do so witnesses were called for that purpose and the loose statements which had been put together by prejudiced witnesses with the object of discrediting the irish jury system were not entitled to receive weight the inquiry was undertaken in another place and without any representative on the committee for the other side of the question there was no public representative whatever upon that committee and if the government wanted to take away the jury system in ireland they might at least have appointed a select committee of the house of commons this sesssion sic which might have contained representatives of the different sections of the house upon the report of that committee they might have founded their claim for the abolition of trial by jury it was said that hundreds or thousands of people in ireland had confidence in the irish judges mr plunket i said hundreds of thousands there might be hundreds of thousands who had confidence in the irish judges as judges in ordinary cases but he did not believe there were many thousands who had confidence in the irish judges as jurors and it would be rather hard to expect any large number of persons to have confidence in the irish judges as jurors when the irish judges had no confidence in themselves as jurors they had held a meeting at which they unanimously agreed in objecting to the work to be now thrown upon them they had expressed in decided terms their belief in their unsuitability to administer this act and to be turned into jurors therefore how could the people have confidence in the judges as jurors the committee was about to divide upon a very important clause but he did not suppose that if such a proposition as this had been brought forward for england it would have been allowed to be decided until it had been debated for many days and nights a ministry which had ventured to bring such a proposal forward for england or scotland would not have remained long without impeachment the government wore sic now going to subject the lives and liberties of everybody in ireland to servants of the crown but they must not forget that the very foundations of the english constitution were involved in this proposal they might think little of suspending every constitutional liberty in ireland but as they went on they would find they had made a mistake in each succeeding coercion act and that in this bill they had made the greatest mistake of all since they had entered upon this downward path he feared they would soon be coming again to parliament in the course of another year for yet more stringent powers perhaps martial law and the same old story would be repeated that agrarian outrages had increased and the maintenance of law and order in ireland was still more difficult but at least the irish members would have the satisfaction of knowing that they had done their duty they would remember that they had told the government on the passage of this bill as they told them upon the bill last year that the result would be that outrages would increase that the disregard and want of sympathy among the irish people for the maintenance of law and order would increase and that the possibility of bringing the two countries together and having ireland as well governed as it ought to be would grow greater and perhaps the government might then agree that the quicker method after all would be to allow the people of ireland to govern themselves\n",

      "mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman had stated that the public prosecutor in cases of injury was the person upon whom the duty devolved to initiate proceedings sir william harcourt or the police he mr parnell ventured to say it was nothing of the sort in either england or ireland he did not pretend to know very much of the law but at least he knew that where a person was assaulted and desired to obtain his remedy before a court of summary jurisdiction he laid the complaint himself and not the public prosecutor in ireland the only cases in which the police took the initiative were those in which the public generally were injured for instance if a donkey was found straying on the road the police would summon the owner in a case where an individual was affected it was left to that individual to apply to the magistrate for a summons to protect himself or to obtain the punishment of the person injuring him that was the practice in ireland in cases of summary jurisdiction and he believed it to be the practice in england they knew that over and over again there were many cases where the police had actually desired that prosecutions should be instituted and where the parties had not in eases sic where the parties injured felt there had been no intention to intimidate or where there had been no absolute vindictiveness they had not desired to proceed further and the police had not felt themselves justified or able to initiate proceedings what were the facts in a clause of lines the government had attempted in this extraordinary bill and in this most extraordinary part of this extraordinary bill to set up in ireland a new law of conspiracy and intimidation open combinations among irish tenant farmers had not been usual in times past there had been combinations of a secret character according to the statement of a former chief secretary for ireland in no bargain with regard to the letting of land in a large district in a whole province in ireland could be made without the consent of the secret ribbon lodges open combinations of tenant farmers in ireland were attempted for the first time after the institution of the irish national land league he said upon the second reading of this bill that he had no objection in the world to the passing of a statute dealing with combinations of irish tenant farmers and dealing with the law of conspiracy as regarded combinations of irish farmers on the same principle as the combinations of english workmen were dealt with in the conspiracy act of an act which by the way was introduced and passed by a conservative government they were asked to deal in a clause of lines with a subject which was dealt with in the english act relating to working men in a bill of pages now was that reasonable was it reasonable to compress their regard for the right of combination amongst irish tenant farmers into lines and to take away at the same time the right of trial by jury which they gave in the english act he did not believe the house of commons would submit to the attempt this liberal government was making to so alter the law of conspiracy and intimidation as to make it practically impossible after the passing of this act for any irish farmers or irish working men to combine to any legitimate purpose he saw the master hand of the right hon gentleman the member for bradford mr w e forster in these clauses he was quite sure this clause was designed by the right hon gentleman and that it was the result of the careful study he had made of irish questions during the months of his official existence he knew something of the practical results of the working of the mind of the right hon gentleman he knew that the right hon gentleman had arrested hundreds of men in ireland on the charge of intimidation simply because they refused to pay their rents or asked that their rent might be reduced he could give the names of many most respectable tenants who were arrested by the right hon gentleman and sent to kilmainham and who were in kilmainham gaol still simply because they presented a petition adopted by the tenants of an estate at an open and public meeting to their landlord praying for a reduction of rent he would give one name that of mr crosbie a tenant on the estate of colonel boyce in the county of wexford mr crosbie was the occupier of two farms of considerable extent he was also a trader with a large business in his village he was a man of an unassuming and retiring disposition and he was asked to take the chair at a meeting of the tenants of colonel boyce held last october and at that meeting a resolution was passed in favour of paying no rent until they got a reduction of rent mr crosbie a gentleman of about years of age of portly and respectable appearance was selected as the leading tenant on the estate and the leading man in the neighbourhood to present a petition to the landlord he did so and colonel boyce replied i will go up to dublin tomorrow and i will see buckshot foreter sic and get you arrested the right hon gentleman the late chief secretary for ireland was in his place and if he was able to contradict the facts he had stated namely that he arrested mr crosbie last october that mr crosbie was still in kilmainham prison on a charge of intimidation that mr crosbie committed no other intimidation than that alleged to be contained in presenting a petition to his landlord and that a day or two subsequently the right hon gentleman was visited by colonel boyce and compelled to arrest mr crosbie on a charge of intimidation he mr parnell would very cheerfully withdraw the statement he had made he mentioned these facts to show the committee the way in which these things were done in ireland the right hon gentleman the member for bradford stated when the coercion bill was being carried last year that he would act as if he were a sworn juror and that he would refuse to arrest any man whom he did not conscientiously believe to be guilty of the offence with which he was charged was there any outrage committed last october on the estate of colonel boyce or in the neighbourhood of it was there the slightest intimidation exercised there he might extend the area from the estate of bannon to the whole of the county of wexford from which county there had been he supposed fully persons arrested under the coercion act mr hopwood rose to order had these remarks any earthly connection with the clause the chairman i think the hon member is going very far away from the amendment mr parnell said he did not wish to go any further away from the amendment than the chairman thought right but he desired to point out that he was surprised the hon and learned member for stockport by whose side he had fought in that house to abolish the infamous practice of flogging in the army and to secure for english working men the right of combination should be so zealous in interfering to limit his mr parnell's illustrations in support of his argument in favour of the right of combination for irish farmers they wanted to know and the question had been asked several times and had not been answered by the government they wanted to know who was going to initiate the prosecutions for intimidation they were told that mr clifford lloyd was not to be trusted to administer this law he was not to be allowed to initiate prosecutions against individuals if the prosecutions were not to be instituted upon the complaint of the persons injured upon whose complaint were they to be instituted they were told the other day by the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant that in certain cases of alleged intimidation in such cases as the erection of wooden huts for the purpose of sheltering evicted tenants the lord lieutenant would be the judge as to whether it would be right that prosecutions should be instituted he would be perfectly willing that the lord lieutenant should be the judge in such cases because just as they had left the initiation of the prosecutions of trials without jury to the lord lieutenant so they should also leave the initiation of the trials before the special tribunal and resident magistrates to the lord lieutenant he was not willing to leave the initiation of these prosecutions to the stray resident magistrates throughout the country the people were entitled to know what the law was in the first place and in the second place they were entitled to know what they could do so as to keep within the law under the clause as it now stood it was perfectly impossible that anybody could know what the law was and what they could do to keep within the scope of the law in asking for information as to who were to initiate prosecutions they were asking for uniformity in the administration of the law throughout ireland if the initiation of the prosecution was to be left to the resident magistrates in ireland they would find offences differing in every county and district in the country and it would be impossible for anyone to know what the law really was the law would depend in that case for its interpretation and its administration upon the whims of or different stipendiary magistrates he therefore thought that upon the threshold of the clause they were entitled to know who was to initiate the prosecutions for intimidation was it to be the police constable was it to be the resident magistrate or was it to be the lord lieutenant the government ought to give them some information some light as to what men must do to obey the law they wanted to obey the law they were willing to obey the law but under an act of this kind it would be quite impossible for them to obey the law because they would be left completely in the dark as to its nature and extent mr w e forster said he wished to make a few remarks in consequence of the observations of the hon member for the city of cork he understood the hon gentleman to say that he mr w e forster had arrested or caused men to be arrested simply because they had paid their rents he absolutely and entirely denied the statement mr parnell what did the right hon gentleman arrest mr crosbie for mr w e forster said that the hon member without giving him the slightest notice questioned him with regard to a particular arrest though he had had no notice if the hon gentleman was prepared to raise a discussion on the subject he would be prepared to meet him mr crosbie was arrested because he mr w e forster believed he had been guilty of intimidation mr crosbie was not arrested because he refused to pay his rent but on the charge of intimidation mr parnell what was the intimidation mr w e forster said the hon member was perfectly aware that the protection of person and property act was obtained upon the ground that it was impossible to give the reasons for arrests if they had given the reasons for arrests mr parnell said it was a well known precedent in that house that words could only be taken down if they had been heard by the clerk at the table and immediately upon utterance cries of name name no there was another method of procedure open a motion had been made that the hon member words be taken down but his words had not been heard mr parnell i confess sir that although i was sitting very close to the hon member i did not hear him make use of the words mentioned mr parnell said that in the last parliament as he distinctly remembered there was a debate which lasted not only for a few minutes but for the whole evening a debate in which the right hon and learned gentleman the present home secretary took a very distinguished part upon the motion of the late chancellor of the exchequer the right hon gentleman the member for north devon sir stafford northcote that some words uttered by an hon member sitting on that the opposition side of the house he thought the hon member for dungarvan mr o'donnell should be taken down a debate arose and the present home secretary then in opposition entered very strongly in to the debate and proposed the taking down of the words but finally the motion to take down the words was withdrawn on the present occasion ho sic submitted the situation was precisely the same words were uttered by his hon friend as to the precise nature of which there seemed to be some difference of opinion he mr parnell confessed that though he sat very near the hon member for roscommon mr parnell said he certainly did not catch the exact adjective used by his hon friend but some hon members said that a certain adjective which he would not repeat had been used he was sitting behind his hon friend when the objectionable word was used and sound did not travel backwards as well as it did forward that was the reason perhaps that the exact phrase had not reached him there having been considerable noise in the house at the time of the occurrence since he had last spoken however he had consulted his hon friend who had told him that he did use the objectionable adjective his hon friend he was sure would see if the motion that the words be reported to the house were withdrawn that it was desirable that he should withdraw the expression he had made use of the hon gentleman would no doubt be glad to withdraw it and to express regret for having made use of it mr parnell said the amendment of his hon friend was really a very important one because at the very threshold of the clause they were met by the question who is to initiate these prosecutions the chief secretary for ireland informed them the other day that complaints as regarded intimidation in connection with the erection of wooden cabins for evicted tenants should only be brought before the magistrates for decision after they had been first investigated by the lord lieutenant if however this clause was passed it would practically override the announcement which the chief secretary made did the chief secretary make the announcement in ignorance of the effect of this clause or did he only intend it to be taken as referring to the present law in force until this act should have been passed the matter was of great importance whatever reply wore given to this question under the present law charges of intimidation could only be dealt with in two ways and the punishments to be inflicted for such offences were much less in magnitude than the punishments to be inflicted under the operation of this clause at present a person who was charged with intimidation could be required by the magistrates under a section of the statute of edward iii to give bail and in default of giving that they could be sent to prison for a period not exceeding six months they were treated as untried prisoners were allowed to supply themselves with food and there was in fact the clearest distinction drawn between them and prisoners convicted of crime the other remedy against intimidation under the present law was that magistrates could send a person to prison for three months with or without hard labour with the option of a fine and from that decision of the magistrates there was an appeal to the quarter sessions if it was necessary to reserve to the lord lieutenant the right of putting into action a charge of intimidation under the present law it became much more necessary to reserve such a right to the lord lieutenant under the very stringent provisions of this clause now the irish members wished to know did the government intend that this intimidation clause was to be put in force by every policeman in ireland was every policeman in ireland to have the right to drag any man woman or child at any moment before the nearest stipendiary magistrate there was no limitation in their intimidation clause it was not necessary to summon a person offending under it he could be taken at once at any hour of the day or night before the stipendiary magistrate and charged with intimidation did the government intend that the provisions of this clause were to be exercised in this way doing away with the right of trial by jury doing away with the right of appeal doing away with the option of a fine and increasing the punishment from three months to six months did they intend that these provisions should be exercised in the spirit of the statement made the other day by the chief secretary for ireland with regard to the erection of the huts for evicted tenants or did they intend that they should be exercised in the spirit of the right hon gentleman the member for bradford mr w e forster and his pet mr clifford lloyd mr parnell said he thought it was quite clear that the notices the right hon gentleman had described would come under the category of illegal notices and could be dealt with fairly by the ordinary law of ireland he did not object to special cases of intimidation being forbidden and punishable by law but he wanted to know what such acts were it was all very well for the right hon gentleman to say such and such acts were what the government objected to but they were not in the clause certainly it was a common thing and an act of intimidation to send a bellman into a town or village to call upon the people to boycott certain person and he did not desire but should reprobate that practice if such things had happened during the last six months it was because constitutional agitation had been put an end to and people had been driven to put up illegal notices and to resort to other practices that were illegal he did not defend those practices for they were clearly illegal and he should be perfectly willing to give the government power to punish men for such acts but this clause went much further than that a short time ago two tradesmen in mil town malbay refused to supply a certain man with goods and mr clifford lloyd regarding that as intimidation gave them so many days within which to supply that man on penalty of being arrested under the coercion act it was in reference to constructive intimidation of this kind which was not defined in the bill that he objected to give the government powers he and his hon friends were quite willing to see the government exercise their ingenuity to define the kinds of intimidation against which they wished to guard but those acts should be put in the bill as in the case of the conspiracy act and then much of their preliminary objection would be removed and it would not be necessary to insist on the insertion of safeguards such as that moved by the hon member intimidation was defined in the act of but not in this bill where it was left entirely vague and open\n",

      "mr parnell said he trusted the government would consent to report progress he understood the prime minister was anxious that a division should be taken on the amendment before the committee but in view of the fact that they had had no intimation from the government that they intended to make a concession as to the definition of the offence of intimidation and of the fact that a great many hon members who intended to vote on their the irish members side had left the house under the impression that a division was not to be taken that evening and also in view of the fact that several irish members desired to address the committee on the subject of the amendment he did not see how they could agree to take the division until thursday at the same time he might say that there would be no desire on the part of the irish members to unnecessarily prolong the debate on thursday he begged to move that the chairman report progress motion made and question proposed that the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again mr parnell\n",

      "mr parnell said it appeared to him that the supposed concession of the right hon and learned gentleman was entirely illusory indeed it made the clause almost worse than it was at present if it was not surplusage it certainly could only have the effect of making the clause worse mr parnell said he was very glad to see that the view of the right hon and learned gentleman coincided with his own that the addition he proposed to make to the clause was already contained in it in point of fact the right hon and learned gentleman proposed to repeat words in his proviso which were already in sub section a sub section a commenced in this way with a view to cause any person or persons either to do any act which such person or persons has or have a legal right to abstain from doing or to abstain from doing any act which such person or persons has or have a legal right to do the proviso provided that the circumstances of the case should require that such word was spoken or act done with a view to or in consequence of the matters mentioned in sub sections a and b of this section what in the world then was the object of this wonderful concession if it was not intended to throw dust in the eyes of the committee he did not know with what intention it could possibly have been brought forward with the utmost respect for the views of the hon and learned member for dundalk mr charles russell who had proposed this amendment and also for those of his colleagues with whom he was acting in regard to the bill he felt bound to give his own impression upon the matter and he certainly considered that this proviso would be mere surplusage it left the clause in all its full mischief and it did not alter the scope or effect of it in the slightest degree it still left the tribunal which was to administer the operation of the bill to be the judge of the intent and of the effect of it he thought it was necessary that those who undertook the task of putting down combinations in ireland should know what it was that they really did undertake last year they were told that the government desired to put down crime and outrage and intimidation according to the law that then existed and which existed now resulting from combinations among tenants but this year the government told them that the result of the combinations among tenants in ireland had been to produce crime and outrage and therefore that they must now take power to put down the combinations themselves because it was found by experience that if a certain combination was made crime outrage and intimidation resulted from that combination what was the attitude of the government they might cover it over as much as they liked and the home secretary might pretend that he did not mean to put down combination but the committee knew what the results of the protestations of the home secretary and other members of the government last year had been they knew perfectly well that if these undefined and vast powers were to be intrusted to the stipendiary magistrates throughout the country all open combination would be forbidden and it would be utterly impossible to carry on any open movement of any kind whatever in ireland the home secretary said the other day that the tendency of legislation had been to limit the right of combination among trades unions he mr parnell denied that altogether he thought that everybody who had studied trades unionism knew that the trades unions had been engaged in very much the same sort of struggle as they were now engaged in in ireland as a result of this struggle the acts of and were passed and those acts expressly prevented the law of conspiracy from being applied to those combinations of workmen and expressly defined the kind of intimidation and the acts of intimidation for which workmen might be punished if coercion were resorted to in connection with these combinations the irish farmers now were very much in the position of the english workmen or years ago when they were struggling for alterations in the law and when the law of conspiracy was being used to put down those combinations he would repeat again what he said the other day in that house that they were perfectly willing that the government should define the offence of intimidation as regarded the irish farmers and all that the irish members asked was that it should be defined they asked that it should be defined according to the conspiracy act of in which there were five distinct grounds of intimidation laid down in this case the government might lay down if they liked to apply them to the irish farmers but they wanted to know what it was they could really do and what they were not to do and they objected to intrust the stipendiary magistrates with these undefined powers it was perfectly absurd to suppose that the lord lieutenant would he able to control the action of the stipendiary magistrates if he attempted to do so the result would be that this legislation would be nugatory and that it would be impossible for the magistrates to act if he did not do so the result would be that the magistrates who were really representative of the landlord class the class of ascendancy would act against the people and their rights and privileges in taking power thus to put an end to boycotting they were practically taking power to put an end to every kind of open combination the public were told that outrages and intimidation were so much mixed up with exclusive dealing that it was impossible to define what intimidation meant now that he denied and he said that it was perfectly possible for them to define what intimidation was so that the tenant farmers and the labourers of ireland should know whether they were standing within the law and where the limit outside the law was what the home secretary appeared to object to was the right of the people to combine so as to affect other people who were not parties to the combination but if they denied that right to the people of ireland why did they not also deny it to the mechanics of england did the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary mean to assert that the workmen of england could combine and could strike against an employer without affecting that employer who was not a party to the combination if the employer was not a party to the combination he must be affected by the strike and if in the words of this bill he was placed in fear of any injury to or loss of his property business or means of living then according to the intentions of the government they were not treating the irish tenant farmer and labourer as they were treating the english mechanic but they were expressly depriving the irish labourer of the power which the law admitted an english mechanic to be entitled to they were told that intimidation was as protean in its shape as it was impossible to define it it was however defined in the conspiracy act of it was there defined with five separate definitions and this clause of the bill was so cunningly devised by the government that it made it almost impossible to introduce any amendment to it they had taken the clause out of the act of and then having cut the bill in two they had turned it upside down and introduced the definition at the end sir william harcourt said the hon member was in error the act of did not define what intimidation was there were separate paragraphs dealing with particular offences but intimidation itself was left without a definition mr parnell yes but practically the paragraphs were taken as a definition of what intimidation was and were clearly directed to the magistrates to guide them in the administration of the act what would have been the use of putting them in at all if they were not to be read in the sense of a limitation as regarded the offence of intimidation no doubt it was cruel to deprive a person of the means of his existence he admitted that he did not wish to prevent the government taking power to prevent a person no matter what his station was from being deprived of the means of his existence but they did a great deal more in this clause if in any part of ireland attempts were made to prevent people from obtaining food or clothes or fuel by all means treat it as intimidation and put it down but he disputed the expediency of preventing people from entering into a combination they had a right to do that outside intimidation and what he claimed was that the government ought to alter their law of conspiracy so as to make it as permissible for a tenant farmer to do a thing as it was for a workman to do that thing they ought not to alter the law of intimidation in such a way as to make it practically impossible for a tenant farmer or a labourer to do anything at all either with combination or without combination in ireland the government desired legislation to put a stop to any action in which crime and intimidation as now known to the law were the result he was quite willing to assent to such legislation but this clause went to the extent of rendering it penal for a workman to leave his employment by and bye if a magistrate chose to find that a workman by leaving the employment of a farmer or a landlord had given reason to that farmer or landlord to fear injury to or loss of his property business or his means of living would be the result of that workman act he could hold the workman to be guilty of intimidation within the meaning of this clause and send him to prison for six months with hard labour if the tenant refused to pay his rent either through inability or in consequence of the rent being an unjust rent what would be the result the magistrate might consider that the refusal of the tenant to pay his rent put the landlord in fear of injury to or loss of his property or means of living therefore the tenant might be convicted in such a case of intimidation and sent to prison for six months with hard labour he thought the irish representatives had an unanswerable claim to a definition on the part of the government of what they meant by intimidation they had waived the right of trial by jury as it existed in england in regard to the offence of intimidation they had waived the right of trial by jury as long as the government told them what they meant to prevent the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary had stated in general terms that he desired to prevent boycotting he mr parnell should be glad if the right hon and learned gentleman would give them a definition of boycotting and of what he wished exactly to check as regarded the evil resulting from boycotting but they had no such information they had been told by the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant that what he wanted to check was outrage resulting from offences which were now to be called intimidation the right hon gentleman in his speech the other day in reply to the amendment of the hon and learned member for dundalk mr charles bus sell went over a great variety of offences which resulted from intimidation he spoke of the posting of threatening notices and the sending of threatening letters and he stated that some tradesmen in a certain town had received threatening letters warning them not to supply a magistrate with bread the right hon gentleman spoke also of the case of mrs moroney in connection with which a cruel and dreadful murder was committed in consequence of boycotting in the case of mrs moroney it was true that the tradesmen of the town refused to deal with her or supply her with food but he understood that that was put a stop to and very properly put a stop to not by the action of mr clifford lloyd but by the common sense of the people mrs moroney could now obtain food and clothing if she was willing to pay cash for them so that that was quite right if the right hon gentleman wished to take power against any refusal on the part of a shopkeeper to supply food clothing or the necessaries of life to any person where the person would suffer in consequence of not having those necessaries of life supplied to him let him state that as an offence according to law and they would know where they stood but at present they had no definition of the kind they had had definitions given in the speeches of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant but no definition had been given by the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary as to what he desired to put an end to in the name of boycotting until they could see their way to enabling the irish farmer and labourer to combine possibly in order to obtain an alteration of the law by constitutional action they must do their best to oppose the passage of this clause in its present shape mr parnell said he accepted the offer of the hon and learned gentleman the attorney general sir henry james which would strike out the words of the clause from line to line giving the definition of intimidation but he would invite him in the process of assimilating the new law of intimidation in ireland to that which existed in england and ireland at present to go a step further and to alter the first portion of his clause which was altogether differently constructed from the section of the english act and which in fact left the offence of intimidation entirely different in ireland from what it was in england the language of the english section was this that every person who agreed to do the two things described in sub sections a and b intimidated or used violence to such other person or his wife or children now that required that there should be intimidation on the part of some person but in the present bill the words employed were uses intimidation or incites any other person to use intimidation without saying that it was to be the intimidation of any particular person the attorney general sir henry james with a view to cause any person or persona either to do any act which such person or persons has or have a legal right to abstain from doing mr parnell but not to any person he submitted to the common sense of the committee that if they gave up the right of applying to a jury in a case of intimidation in ireland surely it was sufficient to leave the law of intimidation in ireland as it was now the claim of the government had always been that they had been unable to obtain convictions in these matters but if it was left to them to get summary convictions before the tribunal established by this bill without the right of an appeal to a jury in cases of intimidation surely the definition of the law that was sufficient to put a stop to intimidation in england or in scotland as regarded the operation of the trades unions should be sufficient to enable the government to put a stop to intimidation in ireland he did not want the hon and learned gentleman to imitate the words of the english act he had always admitted the force of the contention that the offences mentioned in clauses and were not applicable to this case but if the hon and learned gentleman maintained that in addition to the power given in the 1st sub section of section of the act of that was to say a definition of intimidation namely using violence to and intimidating such other person if he wanted anything in the definition to apply to some special offences which he wished to meet then let him follow the example set in the act of and let him put into the sub section the offences he desired to deal with if the hon and learned gentleman was willing to do that he mr parnell would raise no further objection but the object of the government appeared to be to carry this section without informing the committee of their real reasons for doing it they appeared to be anxious to obtain a wide and sweeping power enabling them to make use of this bill in order to put down any combination however constitutional at their own will and caprice so that it should be utterly impossible for any person to take part in any movement of any kind with any hope that he would escape from the application of this section the attorney general sir henry james said the hon member asked him to give in the sub sections a definition of intimidation but there would be very great difficulty in doing that mr parnell said he did not exactly mean that the hon and learned gentleman did not appear to understand his meaning he accepted the definitions supplied by the act of in the 1st sub section and what he said was that if there were any other offences they wanted to meet or any special practices they wanted to put a stop to let them put them in a separate sub section as in the english act mr parnell will the right hon and learned gentleman repeat what i really did say mr parnell said the advantage of the withdrawal of the amendment of the hon and learned member for dundalk mr charles russell had he thought been very clearly stated by the prime minister who had pointed out to the committee that if they divided on that amendment and accepted it they might sanction the principle of boycotting he mr parnell did not think that that was quite so because a division would not be taken on the words of his hon and learned friend but on the question of leaving in the objectionable words which at present stood in the bill and the fact that those words were included in the bill would make the measure a departure from the legislation of that was one of the chief objects of his objection he did not see why they should say in this bill every person who uses intimidation while in the english act they only said uses violence to or intimidates such other person clearly the power given by this clause was very much wider than the power given by the act of and that was one reason why he regarded the clause as objectionable if the amendment of his hon and learned friend the member for dundalk mr charles russell were withdrawn or if the government would agree to support that amendment as far as concerned the leaving out of the objectionable words which his hon and learned friend proposed to leave out the committee would then be free to consider the subsequent portion of the clause in the spirit indicated by the prime minister but with these words in it words which practically made the clause operate so widely and vaguely that they considered it almost impossible to limit it it would be impossible for them to approach the further discussion of the clause with a view to its limitation in any satisfactory manner he thought that he made a reasonable request to the prime minister and that he asked him a fair question when he asked him whether if the hon and learned member for dundalk withdrew his amendment the government would postpone the clause he took it that if the committee permitted the withdrawal of the amendment the postponement of the clause would then be possible it was a fair question then to ask the prime minister whether in the event of the withdrawal of the amendment he would postpone the clause so that it might be further considered by the government and by those who opposed it he could not conceive what possible object could be served by going on with the discussion in the present state of entanglement into which the matter had got he hoped the right hon gentleman would not submit to the dictation of the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin mr gibson as he had done on a former occasion when the attorney general was compelled to withdraw a concession he had made to the irish members in pursuance of that dictation mr parnell said the noble lord had correctly stated the first portion of his remarks but with regard to the later portion what he had intended to convey was that a proposal should be made by the attorney general sir henry james showing what he was willing to accept he had also asked the hon and learned gentleman to make his clause proceed in the same way as the english clause adopting the words in the english act sub section of section which left the definition of intimidation open and inserting in addition such other offences as he wished to guard against of course he did not pledge himself definitely until he saw the offences that the attorney general wished to guard against as to whether they should oppose their insertion in this bill but it would put the matter into a clearer and more distinct shape to define those offences as they were in the english act of mr parnell said he rose to ask a question on a point of order which might perhaps facilitate the business of the committee in the event of the amendment before the committee being negatived could he move to add after the word intimidation the words to any person mr parnell said the amendment on which he had just asked the ruling of the chairman would have the effect of making the commencement of this clause as far as it could be made similar to the 7th section of the conspiracy act of he presumed the government would not object to the addition of the words which he begged to move amendment proposed in page line after the word intimidation to insert the words to any person mr parnell question proposed that those words be there inserted mr parnell said in answer to the observations of the home secretary he did not quite understand the meaning which the right hon and learned gentleman himself attached to the amendment before the committee the meaning which he mr parnell attached to it was that it must be shown that intimidation had been used against some person the right hon and learned gentleman might wish to put in some limitation but it seemed to him that as the amendment stood its meaning was perfectly obvious irish members said that in the english conspiracy act it was necessary to show that some person had been intimidated and they contended that that condition should be in this bill also that was the point which he urged upon the right hon gentleman of course the amendment would not interfere with the application of the bill to the case referred to by the home secretary of a whole village being intimidated mr parnell said he was willing to accept the words of the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary and with the leave of the committee to withdraw his amendment mr parnell said the reception this amendment had met with at the hands of the government represented the true spirit which underlay their action in regard to the clause nothing he thought could be fairer than the proposition he had made in asking that some definition of intimidation should be given the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary had practically a choice of two courses so far as the irish members were concerned he could either adopt the construction of the trades union act the conspiracy act of which stated that intimidation was to be of a personal character or else define the intimidation which he wished to provide against the right hon and learned gentleman however would do neither the one nor the other he insisted upon retaining these very wide and sweeping provisions which could only have the effect of placing it in the absolute power of the stipendiary magistrates throughout the country to deal as they pleased with any movement or organization for any purpose whatever which might be set on foot in ireland they had had a definition of what the government desired to put down they had been told that the government desired to put a stop to notices of a threatening and illegal character to put down the boycotting of persons by having them followed through the town by a bellman they had offered the government that they had been told that the government wished to prevent the holding up of persons to public odium they offered the government that they had been told the government wanted to prevent violence being used against any person they offered the government that and they said moreover if you desire any other definition of intimidation place it on the paper and we will be most happy to consider it in the fairest possible manner and yield to it if we possibly can but we object to a clause which gives such enormously wide and vague powers as this the irish members contended that these powers were unprecedented in the history of the government of any country and that no government ever before sought from any legislation such powers for the purpose of putting a stop not to intimidation but to combination they had in india a government of an autocratic kind a government in which the people were absolutely deprived of any representation whatever and there had been a land question in india just as there had been a land question in ireland and yet even in india where they did not require the assent of any representative assembly to their legislation they had never ventured with so many millions of people under their control constituting a power and a danger far greater than the irish people they had never asked against these teeming millions in india the power they were now asking against the few insignificant millions in ireland they had shown by the demand they made an absence of all trust and confidence in themselves and a desire to repress and trample on the irish people which would assuredly re act upon themselves they had cast to the winds all desire to be pacific to trust to the honour of the people and they had determined to rely upon brute force and the exertions of a section of men who were hated and detested and that with good reason by the great majority of the people of ireland it appeared to him to be useless to appeal to the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary the right hon and learned gentleman might have his own reasons for the attitude and the course he had taken but he mr parnell believed that the result of his action would be that the cabinet of which he was a member would be dragged to destruction and the government might thank themselves if this and other results which he had ventured to predict should come to pass they might thank themselves for retaining amongst their number a right hon and learned gentleman who if he had any liberal instincts at all had only the instincts of the official and the man who desired to retain his seat at any price to the right hon and learned gentleman by the attitude he took up last session in reference to this whole matter were attributable quite as much as to the right hon gentleman the member for bradford the misfortunes that had come on ireland and the government of ireland during the last months if the right hon and learned gentleman knew the real state of things in ireland and in america and he had stated that he did know he had deceived the house if he did not know he had no right to speak about it it appeared that he had not even in months got rid of his scare about o'donovan rossa and he said he was constantly reading columns and columns of seditious literature in the american newspapers he mr parnell could only say he wished the right hon and learned gentleman would read instead the irish american newspapers instead of finding them full of sedition he would find them even more moderate than the irish newspapers at home surely it was not too much to hope that the right hon and learned gentleman would allow himself to be instructed even at the last moment and would take some trouble to inform himself as to what was the opinion of the irish people at home and abroad and that having so informed himself he would become a true repeater of that opinion it was one of the most lamentable things that the irish people had to face that on an occasion like the present when they were seeking to introduce reasonable amendments the government would make no concession to the popular voice of ireland mr parnell continuing said he thought that what he had said previously was a fair and proper introduction to what he should have to say now he said it was most unfortunate that when irish members were asking the committee to agree to the insertion of an amendment to a bill of this character which would allow the government in ireland to treat the people as reasonable beings as people of some self control and entitled to some confidence and not as brute beasts they had to contend with the crass ignorance of the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary they had been very fair in placing these definitions before the committee they were put forward for the purpose of inviting expressions of opinion and although they had not been met specifically the conduct of the government had been sufficient to show their hand he could see no hope for ireland and no hope for the government or success for their policy of conciliation so long as ministers continued to reject every reasonable amendment which irish members asked them to accept in reference to this bill he could see nothing but disaster for ireland and this country for he conceived the government were doing the lowest and dirtiest work that had ever been done with regard to ireland mr parnell said he now moved that the chairman do leave the chair on an important amendment of this character which the government through the mouth of the attorney general for england practically agreed to or at any rate according to the opinion of everyone on that the opposition side of the house below the gangway but upon which owing to directions received from the front opposition bench they had been obliged to change their action the committee he considered required more time for consideration the sense of the committee ought not to be taken upon the amendment until there had been ample opportunity afforded for discussion motion made and question proposed that the chairman do now leave the chair mr parnell\n",

      "mr parnell said the government had repeatedly stated that their object regarding this clause was to put down boycotting and that that was their object in inserting the clause in the bill now irish members had pointed out from time to time that in addition to giving powers to put down boycotting the clause would give the resident magistrates in ireland the power of putting down combination which under similar circumstances legally existed in england they had called the attention of the government to the necessity of introducing such limitations or provisoes sic in this clause as would deprive the resident magistrates of that power giving them at the same time power to put down boycotting he could not think the course which the right hon and learned gentleman had followed in this matter was a fair one towards irish members the right hon and learned gentleman had taken advantage of the prejudice which existed against boycotting to endeavour to obtain a clause which would leave it in the power of the executive government even in the power of those who were distrusted in ireland the stipendiary magistrates over whom according to law the executive government had no control with regard to the administration of the law to put down any kind of combination in ireland and to control the actions words and thoughts of the people in the most unheard of way now during the four days on which this clause had been under discussion the government had had placed before them the wishes of the irish members that some definition or limitation should be introduced into the clause in order to carry out what both parties said was their object namely the maintenance of the right of combination and to secure that this should not be left to the discretion of any magistrate the right of workmen to combine to leave their employers for the purpose of carrying out any lawful object and the right of farmers to combine for the purpose of obtaining a reduction of their rents these were two objects which irish members could not give up and upon them they must endeavour to turn the minds of the government if possible at present those rights were not left under this clause of the bill inasmuch as they could be taken away by the action of any stipendiary magistrate for his own part he was not disposed to allow the government to walk off under cover of the prejudice created against boycotting and obtain the passage of the clause which practically abolished the right of combination mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman had answered the question of the hon member for northampton but in a very unsatisfactory way he was sorry to see that he had practically answered that question in a way which showed that this act was intended to prevent the combinations suggested by the hon member for northampton the right hon and learned gentleman said that a tenant farmer could refuse to pay his rent or a labourer might leave his employment provided they did not do so with the forbidden intent in this bill well then what was the forbidden intent in the bill it was that a person was to be charged with intending to put some other person in fear of injury or loss to himself or his property or means of living but he would like to know how any labourer could leave his employment either alone or in combination with others or how any farmer could refuse to pay anything but a fair rent either alone or in combination except by putting his landlord in fear of loss to his property if a landlord were told that he would not get his rent it followed that he must be placed in fear of loss to his property if a farmer was told by his workmen that they were about to leave him perhaps at a critical time when he wanted their services it would necessarily follow that the employer was placed in fear of injury to his business or property in fact every action of workmen in england in the case of strikes placed employers in fear of injury to their property and means of living and therefore when any combination or strike was undertaken by bodies of men belonging to particular classes it must be with fear that loss to property would result from the action of such combination as a matter of fact that was the only way practically speaking in which the workmen could enforce the strike if an employer remained in precisely the same position after a strike and found there would be no loss to his business or property he would disregard the strike and the workmen would not be able to hope that the result of the strike would be to obtain the increase of wages or whatever other object they might have struck for so it was with regard to ireland and now the home secretary had admitted that what the bill proposed to do was to take away from irish workmen this very important right a right which existed in england and to allow the stipendiary magistrates to say that that which was perfectly lawful for english workmen might be intimidation for irish workmen to do he thought they had now a better understanding of the position and were able to get a better view of the prospect of ameliorating the condition of the irish people mr parnell said he must confess he was unable to follow the hon and learned gentleman he was afraid that what he was doing although very clever in itself was really hair splitting the hon and learned gentleman the attorney general had drawn a distinction between the intent to strike in the one case and the intent to strike in the other and that distinction he mr parnell was unable to see the hon and learned gentleman had said that where the labourer either alone or in combination struck to obtain better wages for himself it was not an illegal thing because he struck to obtain an advantage for himself it was only when he struck to effect a wrong that the action amounted to intimidation he repeated that he was unable to see how the distinction between the results was to be preserved when workmen struck with the intention of obtaining an advantage to themselves such as the increase in the rate of wages or otherwise how was this proposal to be effected it was in effect by putting a wrong upon the employer because such a strike would not be entered into at all were it not for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear upon an employer to show him that injury would result to him by his labourers leaving him if he did not give in to their fair and legitimate demands what earthly effect could a strike of labourers have if an employer could turn round without any loss to himself whatever with equal advantage to himself perhaps with greater advantage to himself and obtain another set of workmen as cheaply as those who left his service under such circumstances a strike would never be entered into at all because it could never be effectual therefore he submitted that the distinction of the hon and learned gentleman as between the labourer obtaining an advantage for himself and effecting a wrong against his employer had no existence these were two separate and distinct actions which must go side by side otherwise the strike could never have a successful issue the words of this bill absolutely precluded any strike of workmen from taking place which would inflict the slightest injury upon employers not only according to the wording of the clause but according to the explanation put upon it by the hon and learned gentleman the attorney general the magistrates in deciding whether a strike would inflict injury on employers must necessarily consider whether injury had been inflicted and if they found that it had been or that it was likely that it would result then clearly the magistrates would feel themselves justified according to the interpretation given by the attorney general for england in finding the men guilty of intimidation and sentencing them to gaol for six months mr parnell said the right hon gentleman the prime minister had given a fairer definition and a much fairer interpretation of the effect of the clause than the hon and learned attorney general sir henry james the right hon gentleman had explained that where labourers were withdrawn from their employment not for the purpose of gaining a benefit for themselves but for the purpose of punishing the landlord as regarded his conduct towards his tenants that this would be held to be intimidation he mr parnell would be perfectly satisfied with that definition if it were added to the clause and if it were not left to be constructed out of the clause by the stipendiary magistrates he did not see any difficulty in accepting that position namely that persons should be at liberty in ireland to take combined action for their own benefit but not for the purpose of punishing their employers or their landlords in order to obtain benefits for some other people he believed he had stated however roughly the idea of the prime minister with regard to intimidation for instance he understood the right hon gentleman to say that if a landlord had labourers in his employment and these labourers were withdrawn from his employment in order to compel him to give a reduction of rent to his tenants that that would be intimidation but that it would not be intimidation if these labourers were withdrawn from their employment in order to obtain an increase of wages for themselves now he thought that if they could get that put into the bill and also extended to breach of contract which was also not a criminal offence in england it would be fair enough that was to say that persons might take action of this kind for their own benefit and not for any ulterior or other object outside it it was not for him to suggest how these things should be done the government had a great deal of legal skill at their command and he thought it would be fair for the prime minister after the statement he had made to consider in what way the view he had expressed could be carried out which seemed to give to the irish tenants and labourers the same right of legal and harmless combination which existed in england mr parnell said that before the chairman put the question that clause stand part of the bill he wished to propose an amendment which would not come within the censure pronounced against the last one or two amendments that had been moved and he trusted that in so doing they would be able to draw out of the right hon and learned gentleman more of his mind than he had hitherto in his discretion thought it desirable to part with the right hon and learned gentleman had said that he could not agree to the amendments of the hon member for wexford mr healy and the hon member for the county of limerick mr synan because they would interfere with the subject of some subsequent clauses he proposed to bring up for protecting the right of combination association and so forth but the irish members felt that if the clause passed it would be difficult indeed to protect the right of combination by subsequent clauses and to protect the individual who might belong to an association from punishment not on account of individual action or of combination or association but on account of the act of some other single person a member of the same association they might be unable to bring this question of the definition of intimidation again before the committee on subsequent clauses in fact the present clause without some definition left the whole matter in a most unsatisfactory position they could not hope that any clauses dealing merely with the right of association and leaving individuals open to the punishment of the present clause would be satisfactory the amendment he wished to propose was contained in the following proviso provided that a person leaving his employment or breaking a contract or refusing to buy of any other person or persons shall not he held to be guilty of intimidation for such acts by themselves unless it can be shown that such leaving of employment breach of contract or refusal to buy was not undertaken by such person for his own benefit but for the purpose of inflicting injury upon some other person that proviso included the definition of intimidation given by the prime minister this evening it carried out the construction the right hon gentleman had put upon the clause he should have very much preferred the government to move their own proviso no doubt they would have done it in much better language than that which he had adopted but he and his friends had felt that from their point of view it was absolutely necessary there should be some proviso of this kind with regard to these three matters breach of contract refusal to buy they had given up refusal to sell and leaving employment these were three things a person was entitled to do under the present law of intimidation without incurring any penalty tinder the criminal law the prime minister had stated that in his opinion the present law of intimidation should be added to and in some way amended to make it penal for persons to do these things where they did them not for their own benefit but for the purpose of inflicting injury upon someone else he mr parnell had adopted the right hon gentleman definition in his amendment and he should now test the bona fides of the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary by asking him whether he would accept it amendment proposed at the end of the clause to add the words provided that a person leaving his employment or breaking a contract or refusing to buy of any other person or persons shall not be held to be guilty of intimidation for such acts by themselves unless it can be shown that such leaving of employment breach of contract or refusal to buy was not undertaken by such person for his own benefit but for the purpose of inflicting injury upon some other person mr farnell sic question proposed that those words be there added mr parnell said he hoped the government would now agree to report progress the question under consideration was very important and as the house had to meet again at o'clock he supposed there would be no objection to reporting progress mr parnell said he wished he could share the right hon gentleman confidence that the remaining eight clauses of the bill would be effective for their work he must remind the right hon gentleman that the time of the committee up to this had not been spent over these eight clauses but it had been spent over clauses which had no reference to the murder and outrage which now prevailed in ireland on the contrary the clauses which the committee had as yet discussed at any length were clauses for putting down private and public action action which was legal in england even to the proposal to suspend trial by jury he and his hon friends offered no lengthened opposition and by far the most of the debate on that question was carried on by english and not irish members with regard to what the hon and learned member for cambridgeshire mr bulwer said about the irish members talking rubbish he mr parnell must say that he had not spoken any rubbish and he had not heard any of his hon friends do so he had however heard some very rubbishy expressions from english members members who did not understand the question and who would not take the trouble to inform themselves upon the points at issue he would remind the committee that an overwhelming majority of the irish members were opposing the bill in all the divisions there had been a majority of five to one of the irish members against the bill and in no division had the government had more than irish members supporting them it came to this that comparatively speaking the number of irish members opposing the bill was larger than the number of members of the house of commons in support of it motion by leave withdrawn original question put the committee divided ayes noes majority div list no motion made and question proposed that the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again mr trevelyan mr parnell said it was upon no such question at all as that mentioned by the right hon and learned gentleman the member for dublin university mr gibson that the irish members had offered to give up their right of moving to report progress there had been an understanding that if a certain amendment was withdrawn progress would be reported when the sub section under discussion was disposed of\n",

      "mr parnell said he was glad that the government were coming round to the common law definition of forcible entry which prevailed in england he trusted that between the present time and the report or on a subsequent clause of the bill they would consider the propriety of limiting the punishment to be inflicted by the magistrates to imprisonment without hard labour it was a well known fact that the law with regard to forcible entry differed very much in severity in ireland from what it was in england in england they had to depend upon the common law for the power of punishing the offence of forcible entry whereas in ireland it was treated under one of the white boy acts the attorney general for ireland mr w m johnson said the hon member was quite mistaken mr parnell understood that the offence was dealt with by one of the white boy acts passed in the reign of george iii the attorney general for ireland mr w m johnson remarked that the offence came under a statute of richard ii mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman was able to go further back upon the law of the question than he was but he had always understood that it was one of the whiteboy acts mr marum it is the 26th of george iii the attorney general for ireland mr w m johnson dissented mr parnell said that when lawyers differed he felt himself obliged to retire from the scene the attorney general for ireland maintained that the offence was punishable under an act of richard ii whereas his hon and learned friend the member for kilkenny mr marum whose knowledge of law was very extensive maintained that it was punishable under an act of george iii which was one of the whiteboy acts personally he was willing to leave the matter there it was not dealt with by the statute of edward iii of which they had heard so much recently in regard to the refusal to supply provisions what he wanted to get at was this that this offence when it was committed in england was punished by imprisonment without hard labour and he trusted that by the time they came to the clause dealing with punishments under this act the government would be able to announce that they had decided in reference to the offence of forcible entry having regard to the fact that the eases would he sic disposed of under the summary jurisdiction of the magistrates to dispense at any rate with hard labour mr parnell asked what was the absolute necessity for leaving the words out mr parnell said he thought the government ought to give way upon this amendment he could not imagine that any mischief would arise from doing so as it was a matter of notoriety that courts of petty sessions did not entertain questions of title if on hearing a case they discovered any question of title was involved they dismissed it at once but in this case the government proposed to constitute a court which would be able to entertain questions of title the clause ran in this way within six months after the execution of any writ of possession or decree for possession of any house or land if any person takes or holds forcible possession of such house or land or any part thereof he shall be guilty of an offence against this act but instead of presenting the case to the jury it was proposed to submit it to a court of summary jurisdiction the jurisdiction thus conferred would practically constitute the court the judges of what was the due execution of a writ of possession and practically a very large variety of cases would be taken out of the hands of the superior courts he submitted that in cases of this kind which involved principles of law of great intricacy they ought not to interfere too hastily or too rudely with old established rights and give the stipendiary magistrates this very extensive jurisdiction it was very evident that mr blake to whom reference had been made and who was a very fair example of the type from whom stipendiary magistrates would be made for the purpose of enforcing this clause if chosen would not be a fit judge of questions of title or whether a writ of possession had been properly executed or not according to the admission of the hon member for the county of galway mr mitchell henry on one occasion mr blake considered that it was a proper method of taking possession of property in regard to which the ownership was disputed by presenting a revolver at the head of the person in charge of it mr mitchell henry i never said anything of the kind and i never mentioned anything as to the propriety of mr blake proceedings mr parnell said the hon member had certainly disputed the contention of the hon member for wexford mr healy that the method of mr blake in proceeding with a revolver to take forcible possession of the premises was contrary to law ho mr parnell understood mr blake defence to be that he found the key in the door and entered without force but if mr blake considered that this practice of threatening the person in charge with a revolver was the proper way to solve the question in regard to a disputed will it was to say the least of it a very singular mode of proceeding what guarantee had they that they might not have a stipendiary magistrate appointed of the same calibre they might have a case like that of mr keating at wood gift who took possession of property without any process of law at all and without any writ of possession he mr parnell thought it was of the utmost importance that parliament should show the irish members that they desired to proceed in accordance with the process of law and not with unnecessary haste of any kind by putting this power of deciding a question of title in the hands of the stipendiary magistrates they would deprive the peaceable subjects of her majesty in ireland of all the guarantees they now enjoyed mr mitchell henry said the hon member for the city of cork mr parnell with all his ingenuity would not succeed in fastening upon him mr mitchell henry a statement which he had not made he had said nothing about the validity of mr blake act and he had expressly stated that he did not excuse mr blake all he had said was that that which was introduced as an analogous case was not an analogous case at all there had been no decree of possession whatever no steps had been taken by the superior court and in such a case this section would not come into operation at all seeing that it only applied to a case in which a decree had been made if the hon member for the city of cork had been attending to his duty a little earlier in the day he would have heard the prime minister state that it was the intention of the government to associate the local magistrates whether mr blake or anybody else with a barrister in order to carry out the provisions of the act legally and properly mr parnell remarked that as regarded his non attention to his duty he could only say that he entered the house before the hon member for galway mr mitchell henry and at the time it was supposed that he was not attending to his duty he was in the library hunting up the acts bearing on the question of forcible possession if he might be permitted to form an estimate of the candour of the hon member for galway and of the hon member love of truth cries of question and order the chairman these personal recriminations are certainly out of order mr parnell denied that he had made any personal recrimination against the hon member for galway he had not been permitted to proceed with his sentence and he would respectfully claim the permission to do so before the chairman proceeded to pass judgment upon him mr parnell asked if the government would have any objection to simplify the proceedings and instead of compelling a tenant to go to dublin under dease sic act which required him to lodge the money in dublin to enable him to lodge it in the magistrates court or the county court where the ejectment had been obtained it might simplify the proceedings if under the bill the money were allowed to be lodged in the magistrates court mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary had as usual raised a false issue in attempting to show that if this subsection were rejected they must fall back on clause for the trial of these offences he mr parnell submitted that this was not the issue at all it was evident to him that the government in framing the bill did not consider that trial by jury had failed in respect of these offences he failed to see why the right hon and learned gentleman had placed these offences in two clauses of the bill mr parnell said he could not see that the analogy was in any respect perfect because in the one case there was a trial by jury and in the other there was not he was still unable to see why the government included these offences in both clauses of the bill the right hon and learned gentleman had pointed out that they were so included but the only reason given was that in certain cases of offences in england and of course in ireland the crown had the right of deciding them by summary jurisdiction or bringing them before a jury but in this case the crown claimed the right of bringing them before a tribunal without a jury now he suggested that if the right hon and learned gentleman would say that on report he would give up the power of bringing those offences before the three judges irish members would on their part be willing to waive their opposition to their being inserted in the present clause it being left to the magistrate to try them in the ordinary way he submitted that this arrangement would give sufficient power to meet the necessities of the case and in view of the statistics quoted by the hon member for sligo which showed that convictions for these offences by juries were at least equal if not greater than the convictions of last year he thought that arrangement should be adopted mr parnell asked what was the meaning of the offence in law mr parnell said that unless some answer were given to the speech of his hon friend he should move that the chairman do now report progress he submitted that his hon friend was entitled to a statement from the treasury bench mr parnell said he certainly had expected that the government would have made some attempt or other to justify the powers they sought to obtain under this provision of the clause the government were asking protection for the irish police which they did not claim for policemen in the worst slums in london in the worst slums of a city from the river running through which in the course of the last five years no less than dead bodies had been taken there had been that largo number of dead bodies taken from the thames but there had probably been double that number of undetected murders committed within that period and yet the government did not claim on behalf of the metropolitan police the power which they claimed for the irish stipendiary magistrates in regard to the infliction of sentences on persons who assaulted the police in ireland such was the extraordinarily sanguine character of the government that they expected everything they said or they thought for as yet they had said nothing upon this matter except through the mouthpiece of the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary and his few remarks were certainly not in the slightest degree pertinent to the arguments of his hon friend mr sexton but such was the wonderful constitution of this wonderful ministry that they expected the committee would give them a clause of this character without the slightest attempt having been made to present a case for its insertion in the bill why he asked was it brought in for the protection of the police had the police been assaulted in ireland yes well they had constables in ireland and if hon members would look at the statistics of assaults on the police in england and assaults on the police in ireland they would find that the number of cases in england was times greater than the number in ireland he did not think he should be over the mark in saying times greater it had been shown there had been comparatively speaking no assaults on the police in ireland it had been shown that owing to their organization and constitution and the other steps taken by the government in regard to them they were not brought into contact or collision with the people that as a rule the people did not assault the police and that of all the provisions in this bill of all the exclusively severe provisions in this bill calculated to make the people of ireland hate the english government for all eternity and to keep the gap between the two nations wide open there was none more severe and detestable than this they were now discussing because the police had not been assaulted in ireland because no case had been made out as no case could be made out they the government asked from this obedient and subservient house these extraordinary and oppressive powers he submitted that they could not discuss this amendment satisfactorily without considering the acts and the constitution of the constabulary force in ireland he had listened very carefully to the chairman ruling a while ago with regard to what was falling from the hon member for the county of westmeath mr sullivan and he felt it necessary to point out to the chairman that one of their chief reasons for objecting to this power being conferred on the stipendiary magistrates under this bill was that the government on their side had not shown that the people had behaved themselves against the police in the matter of assaults in such a manner as to render the power necessary on the contrary the irish members believed that the government had failed in their contention and they maintained that they could prove by the constitution of the constabulary force in ireland by the character of the force and by its action that it was not entitled to the excessive protection that it was sought to give it under this sub section the irish constabulary had not shown themselves so judicious in their use of the very large powers and the protection already given them by the law of the land as to entitle them to or to entitle the government to ask for them further protection during the last six months if anybody ventured to open his mouth in ireland and speak in a sense adverse to the existing government he did it at the risk of being picked up two minutes afterwards with about a ton of buckshot in him if anybody whispered any notion or thought that was apparently intended to make out that anything the late chief secretary had done was not perfection and most righteous he ran the risk of finding if there was a constable near him the bayonet of that constable in his body before the breath was out of his lips he mr parnell did not draw an exaggerated picture of the action of the police during the last six months in ireland or the way in which they had been encouraged to act by the government and although he believed that a change had come over the state of affairs in that country and the spirit of the government and that the present chief secretary to the lord lieutenant did not encourage the police to butcher unoffending women and children in broad daylight in the public streets of the irish towns yet mr goschen rose to order the chairman the hon member must have heard my ruling that this is not the time to discuss the services of the force as a body it is for the committee to confine itself simply to the question as to whether special protection should be given to the police or not mr parnell said his argument was simply this that the continued action of the police in ireland and the continued action of the government did not make out a case for giving these further powers if that were not a legitimate argument he did not know what was he would not venture for a single moment to dispute the ruling of the chair and if the chairman said he might not point to what had happened in ireland to the abuse of power by the authorities and the police in ireland during the last six months to show that the government could not be trusted with further powers of course he should not press the matter further he thought however he was entitled to use this argument or that he had legitimate grounds for complaining that part of the rights of the irish members had been taken away from them on the present occasion he would fall back on his original contention and call on the government and he thought they were entitled to call upon it to make out their case why did they want this excessive power why did they want this power of sending everybody who looked cross at a policeman to gaol for six months with hard labour that was practically the effect of this sub section hon members knew very well how the constabulary provoked the people the police went in the public houses and acted in a rough way to the people but if the slightest retaliation was attempted the retaliation that any man under the circumstances would be betrayed into it would be construed into an offence under this clause and this bill and the man offending would be liable to the penalty of six months imprisonment there was not a single particle of foundation for the contention put forward by the government with regard to this sub section they were not entitled either in consideration of the number or the character of the assaults on the police to claim this power than which there had been no instance of so excessive and severe a power being asked for during the years which had elapsed since the union mr parnell said that protection was not given to policemen in england before courts of summary jurisdiction mr parnell said he would ask the right hon and learned gentleman whether he would not agree to leave the latter part of the amendment out namely the words or in consequence thereof the amendment was vague but it did not need very much alteration he should he unwilling to divide the committee on the matter but in order to put the thing in proper form he would move to amend the proposed amendment by leaving out the words he had mentioned amendment proposed to the proposed amendment to leave out the words or in consequence thereof mr parnell mr parnell proposed an amendment to insert in sub section a after the word is the words and persists in remaining the sub section seemed to him a very extraordinary one it provided that every person who is a member of an unlawful association as denned by this act shall be guilty of an offence against this act and then turning to clause of the act defining unlawful association he found that the words unlawful association meant an association formed or carrying on operations a for the commission of crimes or b for encouraging or aiding persons to commit crimes and the term crime meant any offence against this act and also any crime punishable on indictment by imprisonment with hard labour or by any greater punishment while by this 6th clause membership of an unlawful association as defined by the act was made an offence against the act by clause an association formed for carrying on operations for the commission of crimes or for encouraging persons to commit crimes was an offence against the act and thus it would happen that if two magistrates held that any local association for tenant right or otherwise was an association formed for purposes of intimidation or for encouraging or aiding persons to commit intimidation every member of that association no matter how guiltless he might be of any desire to participate in encouraging intimidation or in intimidation itself and no matter how much opposed he might be to intimidation would be liable to be found guilty by a judicial decision of two magistrates that the association to which he belonged was unlawful every member of that association would be liable to be found guilty as a matter of consequence under the act and would be liable to six months imprisonment with hard labour his amendment had a limiting effect and he submitted that that was a proper and necessary effect in connection with this portion of the clause his object in moving the amendment it might be possible to carry out the object in better words and he would leave that to the government if they accepted the principle was that where a judicial decision had been given that an association was an unlawful association any member of that association might be entitled to escape punishment by withdrawing from membership amendment proposed in page line after the word is to insert the words and persists in remaining mr parnell question proposed that those words be there inserted mr parnell i have not agreed to that proposition yet because i have not come to it mr parnell said he was of opinion that the adjudication must take place before persons could be convicted as members of an unlawful association and the unlawful association must first be declared to be unlawful sir william harcourt pointed out that the adjudication might be on the conduct of an individual who was proved at the same time to be a member of an association for instance one or two or three men might be brought before a magistrate charged with being members of an association which it was clear was for the purpose of promoting the commission of offences under the act and it might at the same time be shown that they were parties to the actions of that association and therefore perfectly cognizant of its objects it seemed to him that such men ought not to escape punishment mr parnell said his point was with reference to an association which had not been adjudicated an unlawful association persons might be charged with being members of an unlawful association that was their offence they had committed no other offence the utmost limit or gravity of their offence would have been a subscription to the association magistrates would receive evidence which would induce them to believe that the association was of an illegal character and that unlawful character would have arisen from the acts of persons other than those charged who would not have been in that case guilty of any offence except the single offence of having subscribed and enrolled themselves in the ranks of the association it might be that persons owing to whose acts the association was unlawful had not become amenable and what he wished to guard against was that any members of an association as soon as it had been adjudicated unlawful should not be held guilty of an offence against the act merely because they had become formal members but had not taken any part in the association other than by subscribing money to carry out its political objects mr parnell said if the home secretary would accept the words who is a member of an association knowing it to be unlawful he should be happy to withdraw his amendment all he wanted to provide was that if any person who was a member of any association formed in ireland without knowing that the tendency of the association was unlawful or if when he learned that he withdrew from the association he should not be punished for the mere fact of having been a member that was all he wanted and it seemed to him that that could be met by making the subsection run in this way is a member of an association knowing the same to be unlawful then after the first decision was given and after the first person had been convicted for being a member of an unlawful association everybody would know that it was unlawful and would have no excuse for remaining members of it if they then retired they ought to be protected mr parnell said he would have no objection to defer the matter to report if the committee considered that that would be the most desirable step to take there appeared to be a radical difference between a clause which ran in this way every person who knowingly is a member of an unlawful association as defined by this act and every person who is a member of an association knowing the same to be unlawful what he wished to ask the home secretary was whether the insertion of the word knowingly made it necessary before a conviction could be made that the person belonging to the association should possess the knowledge that the association was unlawful supposing there was an absence of any illegal acts upon the part of the person accused that was the end for which he wished to provide because it must be remembered that this clause made it a crime for a person to belong to an unlawful association although he might not have committed any illegal act himself the crime consisted in belonging to the association a man might belong to an association in the most formal way he might be desirous of leaving it when he discovered its illegal character but the fact of having belonged to it made him guilty of an offence against this act he admitted that it was right that the home secretary should have time to consider the effect of the introduction of the word knowingly in different parts of the clause but what he wished to ask the right hon and learned gentleman was this was it his opinion and desire that a person should not be convicted who had not committed any offence against this act other than that of being a member of an unlawful association knowing the association to be unlawful mr parnell said he was very sorry to press the point but it was one of great importance and it was quite proper the committee should understand what the home secretary meant in reference to it before they passed it by the right hon and learned gentleman had said that a person could not be convicted unless he knew what the objects of the association he belonged to were and that if the objects of the association were unlawful he could be convicted but a person might know what the objects of his association were and yet not know they were unlawful that was precisely the difficulty he mr parnell felt in this matter he was perfectly willing to leave it in the way just stated by the solicitor general for england namely that a person should know that the objects of the association were unlawful it did not satisfy him however that a person should merely know that he was a member of an association the objects of which were unlawful the two things did not necessarily follow a person might be and very probably would be before decisions were given under the act a member of an association the objects of which were unlawful without his knowing they were unlawful he did not wish to protect a person for one moment when that person knew that the objects of the association to which he belonged were unlawful and if the insertion of the word knowingly was only intended to strike at those who had really a guilty knowledge he would be perfectly satisfied mr parnell said probably the best thing he could do would be to accept the statement of the home secretary namely that he would insert knowingly now and consider the matter further between this and report he begged to withdraw the amendment mr parnell said he thought the right hon and learned gentleman might give an undertaking to cut out the subsections mentioned by his mr parnell's hon friend the member for sligo mr sexton on the report they certainly seemed to be absurd and would be of no use under any circumstances\n",

      "mr parnell sir in reference to this question of evictions which has been raised by the hon and gallant member for galway colonel nolan i wish as i see the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland mr trevelyan in his place to point out to him that evictions in ireland are increasing to an enormous extent and i wish to ash him whether he will not consider the advisability of taking saturday sittings for the passage of the arrears bill i am sure the irish members would give their support to such a course and possibly a sufficient number of english members could be got together for the discussion of the bill on saturdays because the number of evictions in ireland at present is very alarming owing to the fact that in a great number of the evictions now taking place the tenants are not re admitted as caretakers they are consequently turned out of their homes and their little store of food and money that might be used for the purpose of redeeming their holdings is consumed in supporting themselves and in order to keep a roof over their heads and the heads of their families i wish to draw the attention of the right hon gentleman to this fact that since the first quarter of this year evictions are increasing every month in a very alarming proportion the evictions during the first quarter of this year amounted to over persons that was at the rate of a little over persons a month in the month of january i think there were over persons and evictions have been increasing since during the month of may the fifth month of the year there were over person evicted and if that proportion is maintained it will make a number of over evictions for the next quarter but as the number of evicted persons is increasing so largely we must probably expect that during the next quarter instead of persons there will be something like persons evicted now i wish to ask the right hon gentleman whether as the person responsible in this house for the maintenance of law and order in ireland he does not view with the greatest anxiety and alarm the enormous increase in the number of evictions in the west and south west of that country and whether he does not fear that those evictions will make the task of maintaining law and order in ireland very much more difficult by her majesty government in ireland unfortunately as regards decrees which were granted at the last quarter sessions there is no way of preventing them from being executed i understand that at least half the tenantry in some counties in ireland who were in arrears of rent were decreed at last quarter sessions and as a consequence it is in the power of the landlords to execute these decrees at any time and the execution of these decrees can only be stopped by the passing of the arrears of pent sic ireland bill it is not possible under the act of to obtain from any court in ireland a stay of ejectment process once it is granted by the court it is possible and i hope the teuants sic will exercise the right given them under the act of of applying at the next quarter sessions throughout ireland to the chairman to stay execution of the decrees which may be applied for by the landlords in cases where they come under the operation of the arrears of rent ireland bill and in the terms provided by that bill namely that there should be a year rent paid within a reasonable time up to the 1st of last november even if a stay is put upon the proceedings in these cases considerable costs will be incurred which the tenants have to pay but as regards the other class of cases where ejectment decrees were already issued at last quarter sessions throughout ireland and which have not been yet executed there is no possible way of putting a stop to the execution of the decrees except by passing this bill i would therefore put it to the right hon gentleman in view of the fact that so many important questions still remain for discussion on the prevention of crime bill whether he himself is not impressed with the necessity of asking the house to give him facilities by means of saturday sittings for the purpose of making some progress with the arrears of pent sic ireland bill mr parnell not after they have granted the decree mr parnell no\n",

      "mr parnell proposed an amendment which he hoped the government would agree to accept namely in line after safety to insert provided that in case of meetings for lawful objects summoned by handbill placard or other public advertisement and whereof six days notice has been given the lord lieutenant shall give by similar notice in the district at least three clear days notice of such prohibition the object of that amendment was to provide that where six days notice was given of a meeting the lord lieutenant should give a notice of half that period warning people not to attend the meeting the reasonable character of that amendment was apparent on the face of it because if suitable notice was not given to people in any locality where a meeting was summoned to be held many of the people who lived perhaps miles or miles from the place of meeting would attend without any knowledge that the meeting had been prohibited and that they had rendered themselves liable to imprisonment for six months with hard labour the way in which this clause was drafted illustrated the sweeping character of the whole bill there was not the slightest safeguard against persons being swept into one wide net and sentenced to imprisonment and it would appear as if the promoters of the bill desired to envelop the government in ireland in a suit of armour in which there should not be the slightest possible chink and at the same time to provide the government with a weapon of such a character as would enable them to strike down every form of constitutional agitation there was not the slightest safeguard provided for the liberties and rights of the subject in any part of the bill just as there was a similar absence of any proviso or safeguard in this clause and one of the reasons why it was so necessary to insist on drawing attention to this matter was that these clauses wore all one after the other characterized by that utter want of any sort of consideration for constitutional rights in ireland nothing was thought of except the desire to arm the crown in a way in which it had never been armed before in any constitutionally governed country and to take away every right liberty and safeguard in respect to the exercise of constitutional privileges he hoped the government by according a different reception to this amendment to that given to others would show that they were sensible of the necessity of altering the character of this clause at least to this extent mr parnell said ho sic was sorry that the chief secretary bad not met his objection or the necessity for pressing his amendment the right hon gentleman said the government might not receive notice of a meeting until the time for prohibition had elapsed all he could say was that that was a question of detail and his object was to secure for the people of a district notice of the prohibition before they arrived at the place of meeting he thought that a reasonable requirement but if the government wished to provide that a copy of a notice convening a meeting should be served at the nearest police station to the place of meeting he would he sic willing to introduce such a proviso if the right hon gentleman thought six days notice was too short a time and that the three days might elapse before the lord lieutenant or the authorities in dublin could receive information of an intended meeting and its character then let the time be extended say to days the principle of the amendment however he must insist upon namely that the people of a district should have public notice beforehand for a reasonable time that the lord lieutenant had prohibited the meeting in question as to the provision of the hon and learned member for kilkenny namely that two magistrates should attend at the meeting that was reasonable in its way but it did not attain the object he wished to attain the object which the chief secretary had admitted to be a reasonable one and he trusted the right hon gentleman would reconsider the matter and agree to the principle of the amendment although the terms might be altered mr parnell thought the government refusals to admit amendments of the most reasonable character were standing very much in the way of their own progress sir william harcourt we have just accepted three amendments mr parnell said these were of a very subordinate kind he had simply asked that persons attending meetings of which days notice had been given should be exempt from the penal consequence of being liable to six months imprisonment with hard labour unless the lord lieutenant prohibited the meeting three days beforehand the committee would bear in mind that the lord lieutenant would still have power to prohibit and disperse a meeting irrespective of the three days notice as to the dangerous consequences of the speeches delivered which the attorney general sir henry james anticipated would arise owing to the meeting being hold without prohibition he pointed out that at the last moment the lord lieutenant had always power to prohibit a meeting and as had been proved during the last months he could send police and soldiers on the very morning of the meeting to stop it when as had always been the case the people would be ready to obey and retire the government had not attempted to show the necessity either for refusing this amendment or for bringing forward the clause he had asked the right hon and learned gentleman last night whether he could give any instance in the course of the land agitation of a prohibited meeting being held and ho sic declined to reply the right hon and learned gentleman gave no instance of any case where the people refused to disperse and abstain from holding a meeting when called upon to do so by the magistrates and yet he preserved a cast iron front and unbending attitude in reference to this reasonable amendment mr parnell said that the danger pointed out by the hon and learned gentleman would not arise the proclamation of the lord lieutenant would render a meeting illegal no matter when it was issued and the people could be legally dispersed but persons attending a meeting without a notice of three days or whatever period the government agreed to would not be liable to penalties for being present that would be a difficulty and ho sic thought as the government were now for the first time imposing this penalty upon people attending meetings without the right to appeal or of the protection of a jury the distinction he had proposed was fair and before the division was taken he wished the committee to see exactly what it was he wanted if the government would agree to carry out the views of the irish members he would withdraw his amendment until the report what ho sic wanted was that there should be notice given at some definite period before the holding of the meeting in order to entitle the crown to punish persons attending that meeting where notice had been given by the promoters at the police station nearest to the place where the meeting was to be held he did not wish to take from the government the power of proclaiming a meeting but he did wish to take away the power of punishing persons who had not received the notice of prohibition mr parnell said that the amendment he had desired to see introduced would act as a stimulant to the local authorities to inform the lord lieutenant in time and not withhold the communication to the last moment when the people would be assembled and would have incurred the danger of penalties it had been seen that the police and the local authorities had left the dispersing of a meeting to the last moment and refrained from giving due notice to dublin castle so that the people were put to the trouble of coming long distances at the risk of coming into collision with the police and becoming liable to punishment mr parnell said he must deny that there was any ground for the statement of the hon gentleman who had last spoken that he mr parnell had in any way used the forms of the house to oppose this bill or that he was in any way obstructing the progress of this bill or encouraging anybody else to do so the hon gentleman must recollect that after all he was an englishman or a scotchman lie was not quite sure which he was and he could not be expected to sympathize as much with them and their exertions to preserve the constitutional liberties of their country as they sympathized with themselves and their own people he could therefore understand to some extent the impatience with which he had viewed the attempts of the irish members to alter the character of this bill the hon gentleman must recollect that this bill consisted of many clauses a considerable number of which involved principles of the greatest importance and the most far reaching consequences taking away one after the other those constitutional rights which up to last year had been enjoyed in ireland and he mr parnell would recommend the hon gentleman to hesitate before he desired to precipitate a conflict between the irish people and the government mr parnell said he was sorry the home secretary had not been able to see his way to accepting the suggestion of the hon member for wexford to go on for two or three hours tonight and finish the clause so as not to be under the necessity of coming down to a morning sitting sir william harcourt i would consent to forego a morning sitting if i could but it is impossible mr parnell said he was sorry for that because he thought if the right hon and learned gentleman had been able to accede to the motion it would have contributed very much to the harmony and despatch of public business the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary and the committee would see that as they would be obliged to meet there again in hours time it would not be reasonable for the government to require them to stop here another two hours till they finished the clause if they finished the clause after deducting the time which would be spent in getting home and getting back again they would only be left with something like hours for sleep and transacting any private business they might have to perform then again it must not be forgotten that the number of hon members who were opposing this bill and endeavouring to amend it in the interests of a whole people was very limited though they would have been willing to have given two hours to the further consideration of the clause to night if the arrangement had been for them to meet at o'clock to morrow he did not think that under the circumstances they should be asked to give any further time to the bill at present it was not reasonable to ask them to go on any longer therefore he trusted the government would give way mr parnell does the right hon and learned gentleman wish to take a division it will only load sic to further loss of time\n",

      "mr parnell said he begged to move the following proviso provided that no person shall be deemed a stranger within the meaning of this section if any justice of the peace clergyman or other credible person known to such justice shall attend before such justice and certify on oath his acquaintance with such first mentioned person and that he is of good character this was an amendment which he should hope the government would feel themselves able to agree to it was one of a very simple character a justice of the peace ought to be able to judge whether the testimony of a clergyman or other credible person who gave a good character to a man was sufficient mr parnell said there were two conditions required to enable a justice of the peace to act under this clause first of all the person must be a stranger and secondly the justice of the peace must consider that he was in a proclaimed district under suspicious circumstances in that respect the clause differed from the previous clause under the previous clause a policeman was entitled to arrest a man under suspicious circumstances at night under this clause the police were entitled to arrest strangers under suspicious circumstances whether at night or day it was clear that if a person was arrested and then got a justice of the peace or a clergyman or other credible person in the district to vouch for his good character and honesty he ought not to be considered a stranger he could not be a stranger under those circumstances because he would be known to persons of repute and position in the district therefore he submitted that he had made out his claim in regard to where evidence of that kind was produced a magistrate should be checked if a man was not a stranger the magistrate would be within his right in imprisoning a man but as the clause now stood the question as to whether a man was a stranger or not was practically left to the police to decide and in most cases the magistrate would only decide whether the man was in a proclaimed district under suspicious circumstances he thought it was fair that if under those circumstances an accused person arrested under the provisions of this extraordinary clause produced some magistrate clergyman or other credible person to testify in his behalf that he was not a stranger in the district the magistrate ought not to have jurisdiction and the man ought not to be brought under the operation of this clause he thought the government might have met him in this matter and in consequence of their answer he should be obliged to take the sense of the committee on the amendment mr parnell said if a person was discovered under the circumstances mentioned by the right hon and learned gentleman the secretary of state for the home department he might be sentenced to three months imprisonment under the present law by summary jurisdiction mr parnell said the secretary of state for the home department had stated that his desire was to use this clause against murderers and conspirators he mr parnell apprehended the right hon and learned gentleman would have to make a very wide use of the clause in a large city like dublin if he expected it to be of any use against murderous conspiracies which he supposed might exist in ireland a clause of this kind would be absolutely useless for such a purpose in a large city while it would only afford a temptation to the police in large cities to harass people who were going about their lawful business he could quite understand that the police in a city like dublin might think it of the greatest importance and quite in accord with their duty to harass people who might come from the united states of america in order to visit the popular national industrial exhibition in autumn next and he thought the secretary of state for the home department might have excluded dublin from the operation of this clause during the period of the exhibition that was during the three mouths stated in the amendment the clause was based on the clause in the act of which was admittedly brought in for the purpose of dealing with an agrarian conspiracy agrarian conspirators it was manifest had to move about the country from place to place and in moving about the country they were liable to come under the notice of the police but any person going to and remaining in a city with the intention of committing a murder or other outrage would not be at all likely to come under their notice in the manner hoped for under this clause it appeared to him that it was only an excessive desire to inflict discomfort on all the humbler classes in ireland that induced the government to reject all consideration of this amendment it was perfectly intolerable that a clause of this kind should apply to dublin or cork and there was not a shadow of excuse for it in what way would this clause have helped the government to prevent the murders in phoenix park it would not have been of the slightest assistance to prevent those murders and he hoped the government would show a desire to meet the irish members in this matter at all events by agreeing to omit dublin from the clause during the period of the exhibition\n",

      "mr parnell said ho sic never yet had seen a minister of the crown who had anything to do with the progress of a measure through that house satisfied that the advance of that measure was proportionate to the amount of time devoted to it and he did not know why the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland should be an exception to the general rule he mr parnell agreed with the hon and learned member for mayo mr o'connor power that they ought not to be called upon to vote away the liberty of the press in ireland in a single hour though it was true that the amendments of the right hon and learned gentleman the secretary of state for the home department did away with a great many of the objections the irish members felt to that clause still this was no doubt a section of the bill which even in its shortened condition retaining only the 1st sub section gave enormous powers to the executive in ireland over the freedom of the press in that country in fact it practically put newspaper editors at the mercy of the executive authorities the lord lieutenant practically had power now to seize newspapers that he considered objectionable and there was no way in which newspaper proprietors could prevent the exercise of that power because it would rest upon a newspaper proprietor to bring an action against the authorities and everyone must know that it would be impossible for a journalist in ireland to obtain a verdict from a jury that would be empannelled on such a case party feeling running so high as to the other clauses clauses and the government had taken ample nay more than ample power to deal penally with editors of newspapers and they had made out no case why this additional power that they sought should be granted it was true the secretary of state for the home department had attempted for the first time on this bill to justify the provisions in question for the first time he had given them an example undoubtedly the right hon and learned gentleman had selected his example most unfortunately because he had chosen to refer to something which had appeared in a conservative paper a landlord journal in the county of clare in this case the offence of boycotting was illustrated and what was the intention with which this conservative paper had published a boycotting notice it was to show what a heinous institution the irish national land league was when such a notice could be issued apparently in its name such was the example the right hon and learned gentleman was content to select as a justification for the demand he made for this extra power he mr parnell would challenge the right hon and learned gentleman to select a single passage from any popular newspaper in ireland upon which charges of this description could be founded he mr parnell knew as a matter of fact that no popular newspaper during the whole of last winter dared publish such an extract as that which the right hon and learned gentleman had referred to if any popular journal had done so the editor would have been arrested under the coercion act by the chief secretary for ireland and sent to kilmainham on the contrary irish popular journals during the past six or seven months had been exceedingly careful with regard to the original matter they admitted into their columns he would call on the secretary of state for the home department to give any passage from united ireland newspaper which had been seized in innumerable instances last winter upon which such a charge as that the right hon and learned gentleman had made against a conservative paper could be founded why was not the editor of that conservative journal from which the right hon and learned gentleman had read an extract arrested under the coercion act simply because the newspaper was conservative and because the object of that incitement to assassination by the editor of that journal was for the purpose of running down the land league and showing up its work the suggestion he mr parnell would make as to this question of progress would be this he believed the hon member who had moved the amendment did not intend seriously to press it in that case let the committee go on with the discussion upon the amendments before them until they came to a point upon which there was a serious difference of opinion when that serious difference arose then let them report progress mr parnell said he would move an amendment with the object of providing that where a newspaper was seized the editor or other person responsible for the publication might know what the objectionable matter was and so might prevent its re publication in subsequent issues amendment proposed in page line at end to add in every case where copies of a newspaper are seized the order directing the seizure shall specify the matter objected to mr parnell mr parnell said he was sorry to say that he could not accept the suggestion of the secretary of state for the home department because one of his objects was to provide that the lord lieutenant should have seen a newspaper before he ordered its seizure and examined the objectionable passages he wished to remind the right hon and learned gentleman and the committee that the reason put forward by the front opposition bench to induce the right hon and learned gentleman to make a change in the amendment was that it might be inconvenient for the government in dealing with foreign newspapers which might get into the country and be circulated if they had no opportunity of seeing and seizing them he thought it so desirable that proper precautions should be taken with regard to irish newspapers that was to say that there should be no risk in their case that he would suggest that if the right hon and learned gentleman desired on report to introduce some special provision to meet the case raised with regard to foreign newspapers that would be very fair but he did think that it would be desirable to require that the lord lieutenant should have seen a newspaper before seizing it there was no practical inconvenience in this course because the newspaper could not be circulated through dublin without the lord lieutenant having an ample opportunity of seeing it with regard to country newspapers their circulation was very limited but the lord lieutenant would be able to get information by telegram as to any contents which might be objectionable he hoped the secretary of state for the home department would allow the amendment to pass as it was and then before report they might consider what modification should be introduced to meet the objection as to foreign papers after the government had admitted the principle of the amendment he thought it was only fair that they should introduce the sub section into the bill and then on report it would be permissible for the right hon and learned gentleman to propose any modification mr parnell understood the right hon and learned gentleman the secretary of state for the home department to adopt substantially the provision contained in his mr parnell's sub section with regard to home newspapers reserving to himself the right to bring up on report a special provision with regard to foreign newspapers upon that understanding he would ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdrawn mr parnell said he would like to move pro formâ sic an amendment providing that in case of seizure the person who executed the seizure should take with him a copy of the order authorizing the seizure he could understand it would be perhaps inconvenient to present the order in cases where papers were seized from street vendors but he thought that in the case of tradesmen who sold papers over their counters the constables making the seizure should be required to show that they had legal authority sir william harcourt asked the hon gentleman to let the proposed amendment stand over until report it was very proper that the person interested ought to be furnished with information as to the ground on which the seizure had been made but what limitations should be put upon that required some consideration in principle the ground on which the seizure was made ought to be accessible but he would like time to consider how the thing should be carried out mr parnell said he would defer the matter for report and he would also defer until report the introduction of a third sub section he had to propose to the clause\n",

      "mr parnell said he wished to point out that the clause was drawn for the purpose of enabling inspectors and sub inspectors of constabulary to make search for arms and illegal documents the right hon gentleman said that he would introduce an amendment later on into the clause which would prevent search by night except where there was reason to suspect that a meeting was being held of a secret society or illegal society in the house or about the premises in which the search was being made but the question he had to put to the right hon gentleman was this for what purpose was the search to be made was it to be made under these circumstances that was to say where there was reasonable suspicion that a secret society was holding a meeting search was to be made for the purpose of discovering arms or illegal documents for the purpose specified in the clause or was it to be made for the purpose of discovering the meeting in the latter case he would respectfully submit to the prime minister that the most convenient course would he to cut out the power of search by night as regarded arms and illegal documents and bring up a new clause dealing with the right of entry he said entry because it was not a correct definition to call it right of search at night for the purpose of discovering whether there was an illegal meeting being held or not he repeated that the clause only referred to search for the purpose of discovering arms and illegal documents and he feared that if the power of search were left expressly stated in the clause it would be used by the police for all manner of searches entirely apart from the question whether illegal documents or arms were to be found or not mr parnell said he understood from the statement of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant that the government proposed to leave in the clause words giving power to the police to make search in the manner described in the daytime and that the government would bring up a sub section on report giving the police power with regard to entering premises at night for the purpose of detecting illegal meetings mr parnell said he agreed with the desirability of not entering into a discussion upon the statement of the prime minister at that moment but at the same time he thought it right to endeavour to obtain as much information as he could without discussing the intended amendment he wished to ask the right hon gentleman whether the police having entered a house and found no illegal meeting was to be held would proceed with their search for arms and documents or whether they would make only such search as would be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining that no illegal meeting was being held mr parnell said that it was not reasonable that where three magistrates had carefully investigated the application of a man to have a licence to carry arms after hearing the constabulary authorities and everybody else interested in the case that a sub inspector under the authority of a general warrant issued by the lord lieutenant in regard to a particular district should be allowed to go and over ride the action of the magistrates upon mere suspicion and should be allowed to enter a house and confiscate any arms that might be found such a course would be worse than an absurdity it would be a hardship in the first place a licence was given to a man to carry arms but the next day a sub inspector simply by having a general warrant would search a district and seize and confiscate the arms for which the licence was granted on the suspicion that they were intended for the purpose of or in connection with some secret society the authorities already had a remedy for such a case if at any time in granting a licence the police should consider owing to circumstances that might have come to their notice or information they might have received that a person holding a licence ought not to continue to hold it it was in the power of the lord lieutenant to revoke that licence and so deprive the man of his arms surely it was not too much to ask having in view that the government had itself power to revoke a licence that the amendment should be accepted it was a most reasonable proposal and he could not for a moment imagine why the government objected to it if there was any reasonable suspicion that a person licensed to carry arms was going to use them in connection with a secret association that circumstance could be reported to the castle and the licence could be revoked mr parnell said the home secretary was going back on his old tack again he had informed the committee with awe stricken manner that this clause was directed against secret societies but experience showed that if there was one thing which domiciliary visits failed to do it was to reach secret societies he wished to ask the home secretary how many arms had been seized from secret societies by domiciliary visits since the arms act was passed in march of last ear sic had he seized one had a single gun or weapon of any kind been seized under that act which was suspected of being intended for the purposes of a secret association could the right hon and learned gentleman give a single instance and if not why did he wish to retain this power a clause of this kind was only useful for the purpose of irritating the population he knew that many young men shop assistants and others in limerick had been turned into fenians by the operation of a similar clause in the act of they never intended to do anything against the crown but their boxes and private possessions had been turned out by the police on the ground of searching for arms and those men had since become fenians at least in their hearts it was in this way that revolution and sedition in ireland were cultivated he thought as the home secretary was now asking for more stringent powers he ought to show that the act of last year had been in any single instance effectual in regard to secret and illegal societies mr parnell said that was not his question he asked the right hon and learned gentleman and by implication ho sic made a statement whether any arms had been seized by means of domiciliary visits which were intended to be used or were suspected of being intended to be used by secret societies mr parnell said the government had not been able to mention a single instance in which during the last year any gun or ammunition had been seized as a result of domiciliary visits which was intended to be used for the purpose of a secret society and he believed it might also be stated to be a fact that no weapon of any kind had been seized as the result of any domiciliary visit at all thus clearly showing that such clauses were perfectly useless for the purposes they had in view he wished to show also that this clause would supply an inducement to the persons who believed the police had any ill will against them to conceal any valuable arms they might have suppose a farmer with a valuable fowling piece worth say or for which he had got a licence it would be in the power of a magistrate or sub inspector to come in at random after that licence had been given and under a warrant of the lord lieutenant absolutely confiscate that weapon consequently any person who had a valuable arm of any kind would be very much inclined to conceal it if he had reason to suppose that the police had any spite against him and intended to search his house for arms mr parnell said he did not think the right hon and learned gentleman was entitled to ask irish members what measures they would recommend for the prevention of crime in ireland because they had repeatedly during the last months informed the house of the measures they proposed but the government had rejected their recommendations a short time ago they recommended an arrears bill and they believed and they ought to know that if that bill had been passed and the government had not gone back upon their brutal policy of coercion which had proved to be a failure under the late chief secretary for ireland mr w e forster crime would have been prevented during the fortnight or three weeks when it was supposed the government were about to depart from this policy of coercion crime greatly diminished in ireland it diminished as much in one month when it was supposed that the government were going to trust to the honour and good feeling of the irish people to repress crime as it had increased during the four months of the coercion policy of the late chief secretary the irish members had never ceased recommending such measures in order to prevent crime and he failed to see what further proof could be given to the home secretary the right hon and learned gentleman had been a consistent advocate of legal violence against the irish people and yet he now came forward with his last act of legal violence which he was pressing through the house with the relentless determination to accept no amendment except those of trivial importance irish members did not lie under the reproach of having refrained from stating their recommendations they believed ireland would have been pacified if the counsels of the right hon gentleman the late chief secretary for ireland had not been followed those counsels had been followed and the responsibility was not on the shoulders of the irish members and he thought that his hon friend mr leamy was entitled to some other reply than that he had received on the present occasion under this clause as it stood the police could take a man clothes on the ground that they were to be used for the purpose of carrying out the objects of illegal associations there was no definition in this act from beginning to end and that was what the hon member asked for the home secretary had persistently followed up his policy upon this clause of refusing to define anything and of leaving every person and every civil right in ireland to the tender mercies of the police mr parnell asked whether the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary would meet the suggestion to leave out instruments or articles in order to avoid a division mr parnell said he wished to ask what were the regulations at the present time with regard to the reports of policemen in the case of searches for arms but the department of the constabulary required the inspectors to make reports with regard to those searches and they showed what were the details required to be given in those reports mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman had told them that reports were made and it was difficult to understand why he was unable to give the information ho sic had asked with regard to the reports made at the present time by the police in ireland the right hon and learned gentleman seemed to have misunderstood his question he had simply asked whether reports were made in cases of search under the act of he asked whether the reports were made by inspectors or sub inspectors carrying out these searches to the constabulary department in dublin what was the nature of those reports and what were the details they were supposed to give he asked for this information because it would be a guide to irish members as to whether or not they should press this amendment upon the government if it were not the custom of the inspector general in ireland to insist upon these reports being given with regard to the right of search applied under the act of that would be a reason for pressing the amendment of his hon friend upon the attention of the government mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary had repudiated the words which the right hon gentleman the prime minister had uttered in his absence mr parnell said it would be desirable for him to inform the home secretary what had taken place in his sir william harcourt's absence when the prime minister at the commencement of the proceedings this evening on the subject of this clause took occasion to describe the effect of the sub section which he proposed should be introduced into the clause on report in order that there should be no misapprehension or misunderstanding as to what that subsection was he mr parnell had taken the precaution to ask the right hon gentleman whether it would provide certain things and the prime minister replied that it would he would repeat to the home secretary the question he had put to the prime minister he had asked whether they were to understand that the sub section he proposed to produce on report would provide that there should be no night search unless there was a suspicion that there was a secret society or a secret association actually sitting or carrying on its proceedings on the premises searched and that when it was found that no such secret society or secret association was at the time carrying on its business there should be no search the right hon gentleman the prime minister had said that the sub section he proposed to introduce would be to that effect and now with regard to this motion to report progress he mr parnell wished to say he really thought the homo secretary had been standing in the way of the progress of the bill there had been no amendments proposed to night except those which had been of a very reasonable character the amendment they had just divided upon was an amendment of a most reasonable character and to show the way in which the home secretary met them he would remind the committee that he had stated that under the english acts he thought the right hon and learned gentleman had mentioned the explosives act no provision was made for reports from policemen to their superior officers in cases of suspicion the right hon and learned gentleman had said that the reports the police were to make were merely matters of discipline and were regulated by the police authorities and not by act of parliament however he mr parnell found under the explosives act vict c he believed at section that where a search is made without the authority of a warrant if the entry he by an officer specially authorized by written authority other than a warrant a report of such proceedings shall be forthwith sent to the secretary of state sir william harcourt that is the case of a warrant mr parnell said it was the case of a warrant authorizing search not in a particular instance but in a whole district mr o'kelly a general warrant mr parnell said it was a general statement in the case of the explosives act it was left to the constabulary authorities to say where a report should be made and where it should not be made in the act he referred to there was a provision compelling a report not only to the central constabulary authority which hon members asked for under this clause but to the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary himself\n",

      "mr parnell said he proposed to move the amendment which stood on the paper in the name of his hon friend the member for waterford mr b power namely inline after the word warrant to insert at any hour within sunrise and sunset the clause as it stood gave power to the lord lieutenant from time to time by warrant to direct the inspectors and sub inspectors of constabulary for the time being acting in any constabulary district or any of them to search for and seize in any proclaimed district or in any part thereof specified in the warrant all or any of the following articles that is to say any arms ammunition papers documents instruments or articles suspected to be used or to be intended to be used for the purpose of or in connection with any secret society or secret association existing for criminal purposes the clause as it stood permitted this to be done at any hour of the day or night but last evening the prime minister informed the committee that he proposed to limit the right of search as regarded arms ammunition papers documents et c to the day time and stated that on the report a sub section would be brought up to provide that the lord lieutenant should have power to direct that the police might make searches at night for the limited purpose of ascertaining whether there were any illegal and secret meetings going on that this extensive power of search was to be strictly limited to that purpose and that a house having been searched and it having been ascertained that no secret meeting was being held on the premises searched the search should then cease it was also stated by the prime minister that the operation of the clause so far as regarded a search for arms ammunition papers documents instruments or articles should be limited to the daytime he wished to point out to the committee that the clause as it stood now had reference only to searches for arms ammunition papers documents instruments or articles and had no reference to the further requirement of searching in order to ascertain whether a secret or illegal meeting was being held on the premises except so far as arms ammunition et c might be used in connection with a secret society or a secret association he thought therefore that this would be the proper time to insert the amendment a limitation was to be placed on the clause in the direction promised by the prime minister last night and he thought the committee would agree with him that this was the proper time to do it it was quite true that there was a further object which the prime minister desired to effect namely to give authority to the lord lieutenant to search by night for illegal and secret meetings this was proposed to be provided for by a sub section which they had not yet on the paper and which they understood had not yet been drafted all ho sic asked therefore in view of what happened yesterday evening was that the statement of the prime minister and the object of this clause should be made perfectly clear at that stage of the committee mr parnell said it was necessary for himself and his colleagues to decide whether they were to press the amendment or not or to adopt the course recommended by the home secretary namely that the matter should be left over until the report in order that a new sub section might be introduced the committee had had several negative statements from the home secretary and before they come to a conclusion upon a question of this sort it was very desirable to know what the mind of the home secretary was what was his idea as to the shape in which the subsection should stand what was his idea of the nature of the limitation to be provided by a future sub section that was the difficulty at the present moment he had heard the statement of the prime minister last night and he had perfectly understood it but the home secretary had steadily refused up to the present moment to tell them positively what his own mind was he would be perfectly satisfied to leave the matter to the report if he could obtain from the home secretary who was in charge of the bill a declaration that he adhered to the words of the prime minister last night he thought that was a reasonable request for himself and his colleagues to make if the home secretary could see his way to state that he abided by the words of the prime minister he mr parnell would be quite willing to withdraw the amendment and to leave the matter to be settled on the report otherwise he should feel compelled to ask the committee to divide upon the amendment mr parnell said this clause as the side title showed provided for searches for arms and illegal documents and as the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant and the government had given up the right of search by night and only desired to retain the right of entry where they had reason to suspect that the meeting of an illegal association was going on it necessarily followed that the clause would have to be amended either on the present occasion or on the report stage in the direction which he had pointed out by his amendment the clause as had been already shown provided simply for searches for arms and illegal documents therefore the right of entry as regarded illegal meetings did not come within the scope of the clause at all and it would be necessary for the government to introduce practically a new clause although they might call it a sub section in order to deal with that matter he considered it was but a reasonable request to ask the government to accept words with the view of making the clause now before the committee what they desired it should be but he had also asked the home secretary to make some statement as to what he considered the new clause would be and he in reply said that the government would be bound by any statement made on the bill by the prime minister the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant and by himself now the right hon and learned gentleman had himself made no statement and he therefore pinned him to the statement of the chief secretary which they had just hoard and which in the absence of any dissent on his part embodied the view which it was to be presumed he entertained in the full confidence that the government would carry out what they had stated last night and what the chief secretary had just repeated he would ask leave to withdraw his amendment mr parnell said he begged to move as a sub section at the end of the clause the words monthly returns shall be laid before both houses of parliament of all searches or entries made under the provisions of this section giving the names and addresses of the persons whose premises have been searched or entered with the result in each case mr parnell said this was a most reasonable amendment and he should not have thought that it would have been refused by the government the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland said he did not consider a return of these searches would at all answer the object he mr parnell had in moving the amendment as the return would be of a general character the warrant being issued as regarded an entire district the warrants would embrace the districts of a sub inspector or inspector of police but it was of the utmost importance that the committee should have some information as to the action of the government under this bill it was perfectly monstrous that every reasonable amendment should be refused and he must say that if the government were to continue this system they must expect that the bill would make but very slow progress what was he mr parnell asking for why that returns should be laid on the table of the house giving the names of persons whose houses were searched by night or by day what could be more reasonable than that and if the government refused such a reasonable amendment what could they expect they could only expect the bill to be strongly opposed on report and amendments to be brought forward and pressed against every section the objection the right hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for ireland made to the acceptance of this amendment was of a most trivial character he said that a man whoso sic house had been searched though nothing might have been found there might still be a criminal but would bo sic held up as an innocent person nothing of the kind he mr parnell denied the right of the right hon and learned gentleman to suggest such a result the name of such a man would figure in the return as that of a person who had had a search made in his house it would by no means follow that he was innocent if nothing of a suspicious character was found on his premises the amendment was a reasonable one and he should press it upon the committee\n",

      "mr parnell said that although there might not be good reason for postponing the vote on this question until the report there was at all events good reason for postponing it until tomorrow he would remind the committee that it was only at about half past that the government to the astonishment of the whole committee in the most unexpected manner and after having shown all the afternoon every appearance of being doubtful as to the course they should take announced for the first time that they were going to take this very important step the course they were adopting meant the re enactment of the alien act of for the whole of the united kingdom under these circumstances and in view of the fact that only two irish members had spoken with regard to this very important change the committee might very fairly be asked to agree to the motion to report progress mr parnell said he would not stand in the way of a division being taken as a great many hon members had come down to vote on the amendment the irish members he thought were entitled to have an opportunity of stating why they considered they ought to oppose the amendment the hon and learned member for christchurch mr horace davey had asked what interest the irish members took in this matter well they would have an opportunity of expressing their views and of replying to the hon and learned member in the discussion on the question that the clause stand part of the bill mr parnell said the proposition the right hon and learned gentleman was in reality making to them was that they should swallow the alien act of without any examination the right hon and learned gentleman did not give them time to consider what the alien act was though the right hon and learned gentleman might be desirous of having the act revived in its full effect the irish members at least were anxious not if they could help it to allow the act to be revived in an unlimited form all the amendments on the paper had been disarranged by the course the government had taken and he considered it was absolutely necessary the government should have an opportunity of considering the amendments on the paper\n",

      "mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman stated that this was a matter between the sovereign of this country and the sovereign or representative of the country to which the alien belonged but his objection to this matter was that there was a liability of abuse there was nothing in the act of to insure that the person so removed must be an alien there might be an abuse of the power of the crown in two respects in the first place it was provided that the act should apply to aliens who at the time of the issue of the order should knowingly and willfully sic refuse obedience to the order and remain within the realm contrary to the order and after the expiration of the time limited in such order it was provided that it should be lawful for any of her majesty principal secretaries of state or for the lord lieutenant or other chief governor and so forth to imprison and cause every such alien to be arrested and committed to prison there to remain without bail or main prize until he or she was taken in charge for the purpose of being sent out of the realm under the authority hereafter given there was nothing so far in the act and nothing in any part of the act to prevent abuse on the part of the crown in carrying out the powers of the act against persons who were not aliens the crown were entitled by the provision he had just read practically speaking to arrest and imprison in the first place any person against whom such an order might have been issued and there was no appeal against that order except to the privy council the privy council being the executive authority surely in a grave matter of this kind the privy council were in fact a part of the crown and in so serious a question there should be some check upon the unjust or too stringent exercise of the power by the crown her majesty government were taking power to arrest an alien and to put him into prison and they afterwards took power to eject him forcibly from the country he wanted to know what remedy there was against the unjust and unlawful abuse of either of these two powers the amendment of his hon and learned friend provided that there shall be an information upon oath sworn before a justice of the peace and a copy of such information together with the order made thereupon shall be served upon the person against whom the same has been made before any warrant shall issue for his arrest or removal from the kingdom under the provisions of the said act of course that implied that information on oath should state on the oath of the person making it that the accused was an alien and it provided a very suitable check on the abuse of the authority of the crown so far as it went he mr parnell did not think that it provided a complete check but as far as it went it provided a necessary and proper check upon the abuse of the initial action of the crown but supposing the crown did not arrest the person or supposing they did not take and send him away from the country by force or supposing that they did send him away from the country by force what remedy had he got if he were not an alien and were unjustly treated by the crown what remedy did this act passed evidently with great haste and precipitancy give to an injured person in such a case mr parnell was of opinion that the committal of an injustice under the act would require to be carefully guarded against he understood that the act of was not used against any alien therefore they had no practical example of the manner in which these powers would work sir william harcourt said there were examples under the former acts which amounted to the same thing it must be borne in mind that these acts had been in practical operation from to therefore they had been continually in operation for years mr parnell wished to know whether the right hon and learned gentleman could produce any precedent justifying the principle he had just laid down that a person arrested under this act or under the previous acts had a right to apply to the courts for a writ of habeas corpus in such a case would the onus of proving a man to be an alien be thrown upon the crown or would the onus of proving that he was not an alien be thrown upon the prisoner himself these were all points upon which the committee was very much in the dark and if a precedent could be produced it was most desirable that they should have it mr parnell said it was very evident that a man could be imprisoned under this bill for a month without bail or mainprize before he could apply to the court for a writ of habeas corpus or rather before he could be released under that act sir william harcourt said that was not so in that case he would ask the right hon and learned gentleman what was the meaning of the 4th and 5th sections of the alien act he understood the meaning to be that the court of queen bench might take bail for persons who had been on commitment imprisoned for one month after the order mr parnell said he thought the best course with regard to the amendment of his hon and learned friend the member for roscommon was to ask leave to withdraw it in order that some proviso might be framed which would show the way in which they desired the court of queen bench should be enabled to act in the act of this question was left open and there was nothing to show that the court would not be compelled to hold that the existence of the order of the lord lieutenant or home secretary was sufficient to entitle the gaoler to detain the person in custody irish members wanted that the onus of proof should be thrown upon the lord lieutenant or the home secretary as the case might be when application for bail or discharge was made by a prisoner detained under such order mr parnell understood from this ruling that it was impossible for the committee to alter the provisions of the alien act of by adding provisoes at the end of this clause the chairman said that was not by any means the case he had simply explained why the amendments referred to could not be moved the hon member could move a proviso that was not contradictory of the principle of the act mr parnell confessed he had in view the amendment of the act of and was at a loss to see in what way that was to be done upon the ruling of the chairman mr parnell said irish members feared that the re enactment of the alien act would be productive of great hardship not only in england but in ireland there were large numbers of aliens of respectable character and good conduct who had from time to time returned from america and become the holders of small farms and businesses throughout the country these men had advanced opinions upon political questions on the land laws for instance as well as upon self government and other matters and they were in consequence very objectionable to the local landlords and in many cases to the local police who were under the control of the local landlords now in the administration of the act the lord lieutenant must be guided more or less by the information which he received from the constabulary and it followed that it would often be difficult for him to resist the making of an order with regard to an alien of the class mentioned if he were to receive a report from the constabulary that he was a person of troublesome character and that the magistrates of the district wished to get rid of him and it would happen in consequence that many such men would be removed have their homes broken up and their businesses ruined simply because of their opinions they would suffer for their opinions upon the political questions of the day it might be said that aliens coming to this country had no right to take part in these matters but as regarded the expression of opinion he did not see why they should not take the part they did particularly those who having been in the position of exiles had returned to their own country and intended to live there as peaceable citizens for the rest of their days the class of people he referred to formed a valuable element in the irish population for during their sojourn in america they had acquired all the energy and aptitude in business which distinguished the citizens of the united states and they formed in a manner centres of good example in work and other matters which were very desirable to be imported into a country where unfortunately the qualities he had mentioned did not prevail so far as a large portion of the population was concerned if this clause were not amended the lord lieutenant would find it almost impossible to resist the appeals made to him to deport these families in large numbers and great hardship would consequently arise the right hon and learned gentleman when he said the government knew that some aliens had been engaged in influencing the disturbances in ireland for two years and more was no doubt speaking upon good authority and from sources of information superior than those which he mr parnell possessed but even if that were so and it were necessary to remove those persons the act ought not to be applied to the large masses of people who had returned to ireland and intended to live there who were certainly peaceable and industrious citizens but who had rendered themselves obnoxious to the local authorities simply on account of their political opinions these were the motives which had prompted his hon friend the member for sligo mr sexton to bring forward this amendment it was not done for the purpose of limiting the clause or delaying the bill but for the purpose of securing that hardship should not be inflicted upon a large and respectable class of people in ireland whose return to their native country it was desirable to encourage mr parnell said he had an amendment to propose which had reference to the treatment of persons who might be imprisoned under the provisions of this section which he hoped would also meet with the favourable consideration of the right hon and learned gentleman there were two kinds of imprisonment that an alien might be exposed to there was the imprisonment which might be inflicted on him until he could be removed from the kingdom and secondly there was the imprisonment which might be inflicted on him as a misdemeanant in consequence of his being convicted of being found in the country and he submitted that both these kinds of imprisonment should come under the proviso he was about to move namely that the severity of the treatment should not exceed that inflicted under the 67th section of the prisons act of he might mention that the treatment in the first division was sufficiently severe a person subject to it was only allowed two hours exercise out of the and moreover was not allowed to converse with his fellow prisoners he had seen that during his experience at kilmainham there were several persons in the first division whose condition was most miserable from the fact that they were only permitted to walk round their court for two hours a day by themselves the warders always watching them he begged to move the amendment next upon the paper amendment proposed in page line at the end add provided that any alien imprisoned under the provisions of the said act shall be treated during such imprisonment as a misdemeanant of the first division within the meaning of section sixty seven of the prisons act mr parnell mr parnell said he thought it would be right to give an alien except in circumstances of an extremely grave character some time to make the arrangements necessary for his departure there could be no doubt that loss and injury would result to any alien who was compelled in a summary manner to leave the country they had heard of the exceedingly summary way in which some foreign governments acted in matters of this kind by ordering persons to cross the frontier in hours but as he was sure this was not a precedent which the right hon and learned gentleman would wish to follow he had named days as the limit within which the departure of an alien should take place under this clause and he trusted his proposal would be acceded to by the government amendment proposed in page line at the end add provided that the time limited for the departure of any alien in any order made under the said act shall not be less than thirty days mr parnell mr parnell said the amendment he had to move in page line provided an alternative form of appeal of a somewhat definite character and at a different stage of the proceedings to that provided by the act of where a person was permitted to appeal to the privy council against the lord lieutenant to show cause why the order of the lord lieutenant should not be countermanded or the time extended for his removal his proviso sought that an order shall not be made under the said act until the prescribed notice has been given to the person against whom such order is directed who may thereupon before such order is made and at a time to be fixed in such notice appear personally or by counsel or solicitor before the secretary of state or the lord lieutenant as the case may be and if such person shall satisfy the secretary of state or the lord lieutenant that his presence in the realm is not dangerous to the peace or tranquillity of the realm or any part of it no order under the said act shall he made against such person under the act of a person whose removal had been ordered as he had said had the power of appeal against that order to the privy council but in the meanwhile he might be imprisoned or he might be sent out of the country there was also another distinction which was provided in the alternative method of appeal that he proposed it was very fair on the face of it that a person whose removal was ordered should have the right of selecting whether he should make his appeal to the person who ordered his removal or to another body such as the privy council the person who had ordered his removal be it the lord lieutenant or the secretary of state would have all the information before him as to why the removal was ordered the privy council might not have such information and they might be in the same position of judging as to the merits of a case as the person who had ordered the removal it seemed exceedingly probable to his mind that in many cases where removal was ordered the person whose removal was ordered would be able to satisfy the authorities that no just cause existed for such order why not give the man the power of appealing to the lord lieutenant against his removal and to satisfy the lord lieutenant or whatever the authority might be that there existed no cause for such order and in the words of the amendment that his presence in the realm is not dangerous to the peace or tranquillity of the realm or any part of it he thought this was a reasonable amendment and he trusted the government would see their way to accept it amendment proposed in page line at end add provided that an order shall not be made under the said act until the prescribed notice has been given to the person against whom such order is directed who may thereupon before such order is made and at a time to be fixed in such notice appear personally or by counsel or solicitor before the secretary of state or the lord lieutenant as the case may be and if such person shall satisfy the secretary of state or the lord lieutenant that his presence in the realm is not dangerous to the peace or tranquillity of the realm or any part of it no order under the said act shall be made against such person mr darnell sic mr parnell said his object was not entirely gained although he confessed that he had not noticed the proviso which the right hon and learned gentleman had pointed out his object was partly gained by the proviso which the home secretary had named what he wished to prevent was the imprisonment of a person pending the appeal and the 3rd section of the alien act did not quite get rid of that necessity a person could still be imprisoned and although it was not desirable to go back to the question of bail he could not help thinking it would have been desirable to have given justices the power of taking bail in cases of aliens as a matter of justice bail ought to be accepted pending the investigation of the case by the lord lieutenant or the privy council and pending the statement upon such investigation that would be made by the persons whose removal was ordered it did seem a very harsh provision that where they found an alien whose removal was ordered perhaps at a moment notice and without an explanation he should be thrown into prison and kept there pending the result of the appeal he might make to the judicial committee of the privy council or to the lord lieutenant which as the right hon and learned gentleman had pointed out could take place some proviso should be inserted in the bill in which in certain cases bail might be taken by the magistrates it did not appear to him that that would be overriding the authority of the lord lieutenant at all there was absolutely no provision commanding the lord lieutenant to take bail and the only way in which bail could be taken was a very cumbrous and costly one namely by means of an appeal to the queen bench they all knew that in case of an application being made to the queen bench a month might very easily elapse before the application would be decided he had had some little experience of applications to the queen bench first of all a provisional order would be made and then that provisional order would have to come up for confirmation before a person could be released this procedure took up a very considerable time and at the very least a month would intervene before a person could be released the government might give a stipendiary magistrate power to hear applications for bail by persons who considered they had a reasonable case against the order of the lord lieutenant and that such magistrate might be entitled to admit a man to bail without resorting to the very summary manner of throwing a man into prison mr parnell moved to add to the clause the following sub section any person who shall suffer any loss or injury in consequence of an order made against him under the said act may within one year after the date of such order proceed by action against the secretary of state who may have made such order or in case the order was made by the lord lieutenant then against the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant and if on the hearing of such action such person shall establish that at the date of such order he was not an alien or that his presence within the realm was not dangerous to the peace or tranquillity of the realm or any part of it he shall be entitled to recover in such an action such damages as he may be proved to have sustained in consequence of such order notwithstanding anything contained in the said act or this act such person shall be entitled to enter and remain in this realm for the purpose only of giving evidence on the hearing of any such action this sub section brought out the point which was raised in the preliminary discussion on the amendment of his hon and learned friend the member for roscommon dr commins in that discussion it was stated that if any person not being an alien was wrongfully removed he should have a right of action against the secretary of state he apprehended the right hon and learned gentleman would have no objection to the substance of this sub section and that he would be willing to make the point clear it was exceedingly important that there should be no mistake in this matter because as they had not heard that any person removed under the authority of the alien act of and under any of the preceding acts had ever brought an action against the home secretary it might happen that the judges would hold upon the point of law that the wording of the act released the authorities named from all responsibility and that the mere statement that a person was an alien would be sufficient to entitle his legal removal there was no appeal provided as to questions of fact except the appeal to the judicial committee of the privy council the right hon and learned gentleman had stated that there was an appeal to the court of queen bench or to one of the judges in chambers if there was such an appeal against imprisonment that appeal only extended to the preliminary imprisonment which might be inflicted pending the removal of the person and it did not extend to the justice of the removal itself and as far as could be seen there was not in this act expressly any appeal as regarded the unlawful removal of any person it was intimated at the beginning of the proceedings that a proviso would be brought up showing what ought to be the principle on which the judges would entertain these applications for bail before the discharge from imprisonment but this point was an entirely different one as the right hon and learned gentleman would no doubt see it dealt with the unlawfulness and justice of the forcible removal of a person beyond the kingdom and so far as he could see unless it was quite certain that the persons so removed would have right of action at common law against the home secretary if they were able to prove they were not aliens there was practically no remedy provided by this act under these circumstances he thought the right hon and learned gentleman would agree to the substance of this section which legally defined that a person wrongfully removed should have his remedy by an action at law and it left the question free of all doubt as to any interpretation which might be placed upon the act of by the judges amendment proposed in page line at end add the following sub section any person who shall suffer any loss or injury in consequence of an order made against him under the said act may within one year after the date of such order proceed by action against the secretary of state who may have made such order or in case the order was made by the lord lieutenant then against the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant and if on the hearing of such action such person shall establish that at the date of such order he was not an alien or that his presence within the realm was not dangerous to the peace or tranquillity of the realm or any part of it he shall be entitled to recover in such action such damages as he may be proved to have sustained in consequence of such order notwithstanding anything contained in the said act or this act such person shall be entitled to enter and remain in this realm for the purpose only of giving evidence on the hearing of any such action mr parnell mr parnell said it was a very important matter and he was sorry he was obliged to dwell upon it so strongly his hon friend the member for sligo mr sexton had very justly pointed out that it was utterly impossible that anyone could prove that he was not an alien he did not suppose that anybody in that house could do such a thing and in the case of an irishman who had not taken out letters of naturalization the difficulties were still greater it was in certain cases comparatively easy to prove that a person was an alien because certain forms had to be gone through and records were kept of the fact of naturalization for instance in the case of john mitchel who was elected member of parliament for tipperary the question of naturalization as an american citizen came up on the proceedings disqualifying him as a member of that house and his papers were produced together with photographs and his letters of naturalization in the court in ireland it would have been quite impossible if mr mitchel had not taken out those letters of naturalization if he had not become an american citizen it would have been quite impossible for him to have proved before any tribunal that he was not an alien in fact the construction of the act of left it within the power of the lord lieutenant to remove anybody from ireland whether he was an alien or not since the onus of proving a negative was thrown upon the person so removed and it would also appear from the statement of the hon and learned gentleman the solicitor general for ireland mr porter that there was considerable doubt as to whether an action would lie against the lord lieutenant or a secretary of state for the wrongful exercise of his authority he mr parnell understood that the chief secretary could be sued for any wrongful action and that a police constable or sub inspector could be sued in like manner but that the lord lieutenant could not be so sued he supposed that if a person were forcibly removed by a policeman an action would lie against that policeman for damages in case that forcible removal were a wrongful removal these were points upon which he should be glad to have some information from the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary he was ready to give up a considerable portion of his amendment and leave the recovery of damages dependent upon the proof by the lord lieutenant or home secretary before the court that the person removed was really an alien he observed that the clause as it then ran left the onus of proof on the person so removed of course they had had very little time to draft these amendments and it was very probable that technical mistakes had been made the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary had said that a person wrongfully removed would have his remedy by action and he mr parnell had just asked the hon and learned gentleman the solicitor general for ireland whether that remedy would lie in ireland against the lord lieutenant or whether the action would have to be taken against the subordinate officers whatever was the fact of the matter it should be clearly expressed in that clause or some other part of the bill so that the matter should not be left to the constructive interpretation of the judges who would have to administer the act if it had been stated that an action could lie against the lord lieutenant the remedy should be made against the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant and this ought to be stated in the bill because it would be entirely illusory to hold that a person wrongfully removed would have his remedy against a common policeman mr parnell asked if the right hon and learned gentleman on report would insert words which would make it clear that positive evidence that the prisoner was an alien should be brought before the privy council if the right hon and learned gentleman would do that it would go a long way to conciliate the objections to the clause it certainly did appear to him mr parnell and his hon friends that the privy council would not require any such evidence the matter was left entirely to the exculpatory action of the person to be removed there was no necessity on the part of the lord lieutenant to make out any case before the privy council as to the justice of the order he mr parnell was willing to accept the statement of the home secretary that in his judgment positive evidence would be required by the privy council that the man was an alien and if the right hon and learned gentleman would give effect to his belief by means of a clause the objections of himself mr parnell and his hon friends would diminish mr parnell said he was rather referring to the case of a person who had not been arrested but who was going to be sent out of the country such a man would practically have no remedy but an appeal to the privy council mr parnell he might not be in custody mr parnell said the right hon and learned gentleman sir william harcourt had shown that where a man had been arrested he could appeal to the court of queen bench or to the privy council if however a man were carried out of the country before any permanent arrest had been made he could not appeal either to the privy council or the judges mr parnell said the matter had now been very considerably narrowed down were the committee to understand that by report if it were seen that there was any doubt on the point the home secretary would insert words to the effect that the judge or court and the privy council should require evidence that the man brought before them was an alien mr parnell said he would ask leave to withdraw his amendment reserving to himself of course the right of returning to the matter on report mr parnell said he desired to move a sub section which stood on the paper in the name of his hon friend the member for wexford mr healy but which had been passed over at the time in order to give precedence to another question the amendment was to add at the end of the clause the following sub section a copy of every order under this section shall be laid before parliament within fourteen days after the making thereof if parliament is then sitting and if not then within fourteen days after the next meeting of parliament amendment proposed in page line at end add the following sub section a copy of every order under this section shall be laid before parliament within fourteen days after the making thereof if parliament is then sitting and if not then within fourteen days after the next meeting of parliament mr parnell mr parnell said he should be glad to know what course the government proposed to take with regard to this proposition an alteration might be made with regard to the limit of time if the government thought that days were too much mr parnell asked would the right hon gentleman the chief secretary consent to add the sub section to the clause now mr parnell said he would rather have the words police office out if the hon and learned gentleman had no objection he did not agree with the summoning to police barracks at all and as the hon and learned gentleman had conceded so far he might agree to leave the words without the police office so as to read at the place where petty sessions are held the solicitor general for ireland mr porter said this did not mean the constabulary barracks it meant the police office in the town mr parnell said that was satisfactory mr parnell said would the attorney general in addition favourably consider the desirability of allowing counsel to be present as a friend of the person summoned to give evidence so that the person under examination might confer with his counsel from time to time as to whether such and such a question might tend to incriminate himself in any way if answered that he thought would answer all purposes of course that would not of necessity contain the right of the counsel to examine the witness himself but he would be present somewhat in the position of a legal adviser of a person before a court martial he would not be called upon to say anything from his own mouth but he would advise privately with the person under examination as to what questions he should answer mr parnell said one great object in having a legal friend present when the examination was being conducted was to insure that it should be conducted in proper legal fashion it was most desirable that a magistrate should be encouraged to do that but if he were permitted to hold the examination in private without the cheek that would be obtained by the presence of a friend of the witness of legal training this kind of examination might very likely degenerate into license and there would be complaints of the conduct of magistrates during examinations such as there had been of the conduct of mr clifford lloyd while he was holding examinations in the counties of limerick and clare he had heard a great many complaints of mr clifford lloyd and he would astonish the committee if he repeated the language used by mr lloyd to witnesses and persons brought before him he heard from one man brought before him that the language was such that he felt that for his own safety it was wiser to say nothing at all making no reply whatever otherwise he felt that he ran the risk of being sent to prison for contempt of court though he was asked a great many questions by mr clifford lloyd as to his guilt or innocence if the power of examining an accused person had been used in this way the attorney general sir henry james no not an accused person a witness mr parnell said he was about to add if used against an accused person in that fashion was it not quite as likely that the examination would be conducted in the same way in the private examination of a witness here was an example of how it might act a witness was bullied confused intimidated frightened at one of these examinations into giving evidence that did not represent the facts evidence that was unfair this being taken down on his deposition would be used not as evidence against the person making it but it would be information upon which some person might be made amenable this person made amenable being brought before the magistrate afterwards the witness giving in cross examination a different account would be liable to a prosecution for perjury inconsequence of the information he communicated without any legal friend being present he would be put on oath and would make himself liable to a charge of perjury when in truth he had intended nothing of the kind but had been betrayed into mis statements by the overbearing conduct of the magistrate it was a case extremely likely to happen and it showed the risks that witnesses might run in these preliminary examinations he might also be induced to give evidence that might lead up to some other evidence against himself evidence that though not directly against himself might give the police a clue to evidence from some other person in that way evidence might be used to the danger of the witness under examination these were examples on which they were entitled to some declaration from the attorney general it was a most odious form of examination adapted from the french and however safeguarded by the amendment the attorney general had promised to consider as to none of the evidence being used against the witness himself yet depend upon it the ingenuity of magistrates unless there was this safeguard of the presence of a legal friend of the witness would render it possible to extract admissions that would be used against him mr parnell said they wished to get at the minds of the hon and learned gentlemen who had the matter in charge he was perfectly willing to leave the matter on the same footing as the other concession as to which a promise was previously given if the attorney general was willing to say he would do his best to obtain the concession on report he would be perfectly ready to leave it so trusting in the hope and belief that the hon and learned gentleman would be successful in his exertions but it should be pointed out that the first concession was not so great as it appeared to be for it only put the witness examined in the same position should he become accused as any other person already would be who might be accused in consequence of his information in no case would his evidence be used against any other person who might be accused in consequence he would have to give it in open court so the concession given by the attorney general in reality only put the witness in the same position that an accused person would be in who might be accused in consequence of the information given it was practically a question of information not of evidence the magistrate would summon this person before him to obtain information on some event not to collect evidence so that the concession of the attorney general in the direction of protecting the witness or person making the deposition from any criminal prosecution in consequence of his statement did not amount to so much they wished to get information with regard to crime and whether they obtained it in such a way as to convict the person giving it after a lapse of time or some other person mattered very little but what was wanted was to have the person so examined with someone with him so that the examination should be conducted in proper legal fashion and that the witness should not be bullied or entrapped into giving information that might lead to his own conviction afterwards mr parnell said he thought it would be better to allow the matter to wait for report mr parnell asked the attorney general whether there would be any chance of having the bill re committed in order to insert the new clause suggested by the right hon and learned gentleman the home secretary\n",

      "mr parnell m p on coming forward was greeted with loud and enthusiastic cheers again and again renewed he said my lord mayor gentlemen of the town council of dublin ladies and fellow citizens my words to day shall be very few i had intimated to your lordship in private that in view of the present state of the law of this country and also of the administration of that law that for all practical purposes freedom of speech in my judgment has ceased to exist hear hear and i had suggested to your lordship that i might be permitted to sign this roll conferring upon me this great and signal honour in private but the matter has been ruled otherwise and we are now assembled together and i merely allude to my opinion with regard to the cessation of freedom of speech in order to make you understand that i do not speak freely to day that i shall not venture to touch upon matters of general politics for as i have already said i could not trespass into these domains without breaking the law of the land hear hear the absence of my esteemed friend the high sheriff renewed cheers reminds me also that a duty will be placed upon us who happen to be members of parliament to direct the attention of the house of commons before that house is permitted to rise hear hear to what has happened this morning the assembly will recognise that this is not the proper place for me to allude to the subject hear hear much as i should desire to speak freely upon the event of this morning i recognise that i cannot do so here for not even within the municipalities of ireland is it possible now for a man to speak his mind during the darkest days of spanish persecution in holland some freedom was left to the corporations of the states of the netherlands hear hear but i am sorry to say that i recognise to day a situation in ireland and an action by the executive authorities in this country which does not propose to leave even the members of this ancient corporation my lord the right of expressing their thoughts and opinions with regard to matters of public policy it appears to me that the only place in which we can still venture to a certain extent to speak our minds within very strict rules indeed is the house of commons and so long as that is left to us i propose to do my duty there cheers as your lordship has been kind enough to say that you believe i have done it in the past now the limits of my speech must be very narrow i cannot touch on any political question i have spoken my mind in times past in this country and i am vain enough to think that the expression of some of the sentiments to which i gave utterance has been attended with beneficial results to my country cheers i believe that we have gained some things for ireland hear hear but i also believe that ireland has gained much for herself by the independent action of the people of this country the knowledge they have acquired of their rights and their determination to use those rights much of what has been gained during the last year i say is due to the independent action of the people of this country i also think and feel confident that we are but at the commencement of the large measures of reform which may be expected for the masses of the people of ireland hear hear i think that the land act will in all probability be largely amended in course of time hear hear the parliamentary and municipal suffrages will be extended in such a way as to give the people a fair representation of their opinions both in the council chamber and in the house of commons i do not wish to attach too much importance to what can be gained by the action of your members in the house of commons much good has resulted and much good will result from an independent parliamentary representation cheers but i have never claimed for parliamentary action anything more than its due share of weight i think above all things it is of importance that whatever action there is to be in parliament shall be action of the right kind and representative of the opinions and feelings of the electorate and of the great body of the people of ireland hear the result of the last general election has undoubtedly been to secure a better and a more real representation in the house of commons than has ever fallen to the lot of ireland hear hear much still remains to be done in that direction and i have no doubt that what remains to be done will be done hear i have never believed in the possibility of maintaining an independent irish party in the house of commons for any length of time but i believe that it is possible to increase its numbers and to maintain it for such a time as will enable us to gain the great object of reform which has always possessed the hearts of the irish people at home and abroad i mean the restoration of the legislative independence of ireland cheering and waving of hats a large number of those present standing up for the purpose then of gaining that end and in the meanwhile accepting any other reforms which we can get such as those which i have alluded to a while ago i consent to remain a member of the british house of commons for that end so long as it may be necessary for me to remain there and no longer hear hear my lord the exhibition which you opened yesterday gives us the prospect of a field of exertion which will result in a material benefit for the working classes of ireland hear hear nobody who has gone as i have gone during the last two years through the poorer streets of the larger cities of ireland dublin cork limerick and waterford could have helped being struck with the air of poverty which pervaded the working people their wives and children i have noticed this more particularly in the city of limerick which was once celebrated for its manufactures and i believe it is possible for our people by judicious combination so to encourage irish manufactures as to remove a very great deal of that poverty and to give the working classes better employment more comfort and something to live and hope for and i feel assured that the spirit which has enabled you to erect that beautiful exhibition from the resources chiefly of democracy a voice altogether mr parnell will also enable you to revive at least certain branches of irish manufacture and to enable those branches to compete successfully with english and foreign manufactured goods hear hear there are many departments of manufacture for which the irish people are specially suited it was noticed in the procession yesterday that the woollen workers of ireland put in an appearance for the first time hear hear that undoubtedly is a line could be developed to any extent hear hear we saw in your exhibition beautiful examples of fabries sic manufactured both in sic and the north and south such as nobody need be ashamed to wear and such as perhaps we should find considerable difficulty in wearing out laughter i hope each one and all of us will for the future at least make up his mind to wear some article of irish manufacture so that we may keep at home some of the vast sums of money we have been in the habit of sending annually to england and foreign countries for articles of dress which might be produced and purchased with the greatest possible advantage in ireland hear hear my lord i do not propose to detain you at any further length but before sitting down i would wish to express to you my feeling of the great honour which you have rendered to me in conferring the freedom of your ancient city upon myself the circumstances and the time at which that freedom was conferred hear hear rendered the honour still more signal and valued hear hear i can never forget that at the time when the great and ancient corporation of dublin took this step i was a prisoner within the walls of a jail not far from this hisses and the fact that your lord mayor waited upon me in my prison and desired to know if the authorities had permitted him to confer the freedom of your city within kilmainham jail will always enhance its value to me during the rest of my life hear hear the municipalities of ireland have had a great history very much must depend upon them during the next few years of the national life of this country hear hear the people will be driven more and more for the expression of what little opinion may still be permitted to them to their representatives within the corporations and town councils of ireland and within the house of commons i should like to see a still further development of your municipal institutions and the other local governing bodies such as the poor law boards throughout the country hear hear and i trust that this development may be quick and that we may see before long additional privileges conferred upon the voting masses which will enable them to exercise the right of election which the people of every and freer countries possess to the fullest extent hear hear the system of poor law boards and the model of election to them are also well worthy sic the attention of the people of this country and i am rejoiced to find that at the last poor law elections throughout ireland the greatest attention was paid to the duty of securing a fuller representation at them in fact i almost think that an example was then set sic to some higher municipal bodies of the country in the direction of securing really popular representation i believe that the irish people have moderate ideas as to the improvement of their condition and that the reforms which would be scornfully rejected in other countries would meet with at all events temporary acceptance here and i would invite those who may be placed in the higher stations of life to trust to their humbler fellow countrymen hear hear to believe that they have that sense and that practical and calm judgment which are necessary in forming and coming to a sound conclusion with regard to the great political questions of the day hear hear and it would be far better for the governing classes and for those in the higher ranks of society to trust the people of ireland hear hear even at the eleventh hour to join hands with them for the good of their common country hear hear but if they will not do so i am bound to say that we shall go on without them loud cheers and that they may live bitterly to regret the day when they lost the chance of compromise with regard to the great and burning questions of the hour which is now presented to them and which may continue to be presented to them and which may continue to be presented to them and which may continue to be presented to them during the next few years but there is one thing that i firmly believe and it is that our people cannot consent much longer to live in the condition of poverty and distress which has lasted up till now and that if those who are endowed with wealth and education and ability in ireland do not come to their assistance and still refuse reasonable and just concessions before long they will be brushed aside hear hear that the nations and the world will unite in declaring that the condition of oppression which exists in ireland cannot and must not be much longer maintained hear hear and that we shall obtain rights and privileges which i cannot venture to allude to at this moment but which in my heart i believe the irish people are justly entitled to loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell m p who was loudly cheered on taking the chair said i am very much indebted to you for the honour which you have conferred upon me of placing me in the chair at this important conference before i open the proceedings formally i would wish to read you a letter which i have received from our treasurer from the treasurer of the land league mr patrick egan applause mr parnell i now call upon mr michael davitt to propose a vote of thanks to mr egan mr parnell mr justin mccarthy will second the resolution mr parnell in putting this resolution to the conference i wish to say as an impression exists in some quarters that nothing has been done for the evicted tenants since the dissolution of the ladies land league that since the ladies land league was dissolved 18s 7d has been spent upon the relief of evicted tenants and matters connected with their relief by the committee appointed who took charge temporarily of the duty of looking after evicted tenants pending the formation of the mansion house committee besides that upwards of evicted families have been placed in a position to avail themselves of the benefits of the arrears act cheers and we hope that a still larger number will be restored to their homes and holdings in the same way i wish to endorse every word that has been said by mr davitt and mr mccarthy with regard to mr egan we who have been working with him know well what his services have been and how enormously he has suffered by the voluntary exile which he took on himself during the last eighteen months or so i do think that no tribute we could pay to him in this conference can at all afford any criterion as to the way in which the people of ireland regard the sacrifices and sufferings he has made for their cause mr egan has always been a silent worker in the national movement he has been content to work and not to speak while other men have gained the credit of much that he has been able to do in his own way and having worked with mr egan for many years i wish to pay my humble tribute to the unassuming devotion which he has always exhibited in forwarding the national cause of ireland cheers i will now call on you to adopt the resolution unanimously and by acclamation cheers mr parnell i shall now ask mr sexton to read some letters of apology which we have received from gentlemen not in attendance at this conference mr parnell who was loudly cheered gentlemen it now becomes my duty to put before you the programme of the constitution of the new organisation we have decided to recommend for your adoption by some inadvertence the printed copies of this programme have not yet been circulated amongst the members of the conference but i trust that this omission will be remedied in the course of a few minutes when each member of conference will be able to read it for himself and to come to his conclusions upon it the proposed constitution of our organisation may be said to comprise five leading features first national self government applause secondly land law reform hear hear thirdly local self government fourthly extension of the parliamentary and municipal franchises applause and fifthly the development and encouragement of labour and industrial interests of ireland it is proposed that the name of the new organisation shall be the irish national league hear hear and cheers the first object of the association of the league is defined as the restitution to the irish people of the right to manage their own affairs in a parliament elected by the people cheers i wish to reaffirm that opinion which i have expressed ever since i first stood upon an irish platform that until we obtain for the majority of the people of this country the right of making their own laws hear hear we shall never be able and we never can hope to see the laws of ireland in accordance with the wishes of the people of ireland hear hear we shall never be able and we never can hope to see the laws of ireland in accordance with the wishes of the people of ireland hear hear or calculated as they ought to bring about the permanent prosperity of our country hear hear and i would always desire to impress upon my fellow countrymen that their first duty and their first object is to obtain for our country the right of making her own laws upon irish soil cheers the next branch of our constitution is that which is entitled land law reform and speaking for myself i wish to reaffirm to day the belief which i have expressed upon every platform upon which i have stood since the commencement of the land agitation that no solution of the land question can be accepted as a final one that does not insure to the occupying farmers the right of becoming owners by purchase of the holdings which they now occupy as tenants cheers we may strive to amend the other branches of the land act as we will we may endeavour to improve the tenure or the rent reducing clauses but not measure of land reform in my judgment can ever be complete or satisfactory can ever terminate the strife between the two classes landlords and tenants which has unhappily existed for centuries which does not put the tenant farmer and his improvements beyond the reach of the chicanery of the law by making him the owner of his own holding cheers following these lines your new organisation proposes the creation of an occupying ownership or peasant proprietary by an amendment of the purchase clauses of the land act of so as to secure the advance by the state of the whole of the purchase money and the extension of the period of repayment to years hear hear secondly that it proposes to transfer by compulsory purchase to county boards all land not cultivated by the owners and not in the occupation of tenants for resale or reletting to labourers or small farmers in plots of grazing commonage applause this provision has been adopted with a view of providing for the relief of congested districts in the west of ireland and also to meet the just and equitable claims of the labourers applause who we consider should hold their houses and plots of land under some independent local authority and so far as these plots of land and houses go that they should be independent of employers or farmers thirdly the protection from the imposition of rent on improvements made by the tenant or his predecessors in title to be effected by an amendment of the healy clause of the land act of applause in speaking at the last convention held in dublin in the autumn of last year i pointed out the great value or rather the germs of great value in these clauses the healy clause has been described as the single grain of wheat in the tenure or rent fixing clauses its history is a very interesting one it was introduced mainly by the exertions of mr healy cheers at the very close of the proceedings on the report stage of the land act as it stood originally the clause according to my recollection was in these terms as it left the house of commons no rent shall be made payable in any proceedings under this act upon any improvements effected by the tenant or his predecessor in title when the bill went to the house of lords it was sent back to the commons with considerable and important amendments to this clause entirely nullifying it and a compromise was finally effected between the two houses by which an addition was attached to the clause to the following effect unless the tenant has been paid or otherwise compensated by the landlord for these improvements notwithstanding this addition we still hoped that some value remained in this clause but i regret to say that the result of the working of the act and the decision of the supreme court has been of such a character that the clause is practically admitted by everybody to be a dead letter hear hear that the tenants are still by the decisions of the sub commissioners as governed by the decision in adams v dunseath in the supreme court are still compelled to pay rent on the improvements effected in the past by themselves and their predecessors in title and that they have no security if they go to work upon their holdings as we all earnestly desire them to do for the purpose of improving the general industrial condition of the country and of affording employment to the labouring classes they have no assurance i say that at the end of their statutory term of years these improvements effected during that term will not become the property of the landlord and be lost to them hear hear in other words the practice of the sub commissioners at present throughout the country is to fix a fair commercial rent without regard to the improvements of the tenants and upon appeal the practice of the land commission court is under the guidance of their valuers to fix a rack rent well during the discussions upon the healy clause we obtained from the ministers and notably from mr gladstone some remarkable declarations which we are entitled to hold them to and which we propose to hold them to hear hear and applause mr gladstone declarations on the subject have been already published in the report of the speech delivered by mr healy at wexford and by mr dickson in the north of ireland but it is to the effect that it was not the intention of the legislature that the improvements of the tenant should be lost to him by length of enjoyment hear hear that no matter how long the tenant enjoyed these improvements at all events improvements made now and during the last years the landlord should not be entitled to plead that the tenant had been compensated for these improvements by length of enjoyment hear hear nothing could be more explicit than those declarations and it was explicitly stated by mr gladstone that it was a new departure hear hear and applause a departure not contemplated by the act of and going entirely beyond the act of hear hear but what did the judges of the supreme court or a majority of them do they go back to the act of and they say in their decisions that by this act the landlord is entitled to claim that length of enjoyment by the tenant of the improvements effected by him is a compensation within the meaning of the healy clause and within the meaning of the act of now this we deny altogether hear hear and last session we introduced a bill it was introduced by my friend mr redmond which defined what was meant by improvements and which defined the healy clause of the land act in such a way as to make it evident and make it clear that the tenant should have those improvements for himself and for his children after him and that no landlord should be entitled to come in and claim rent for these improvements in the future and i have every hope that in the course of a short time we shall be able to effect such an amendment of the land act if we are assisted by organisation amongst the people themselves loud applause such an amendment in this direction as will secure the improvements of the tenant farmers from confiscation by the landlord in the fixing of rents hear hear i have made a calculation and i think that a fair amendment of the healy clause of the act would result in a reduction of the average standard of judicial decisions given by the sub commission courts by about per cent then we further propose the admission of leaseholders and other excluded classes to all the benefits of the land act with the other amendments especially included in mr redmond bill mr redmond bill is one of a very comprehensive character it comprised among other matters the arrears act which has since passed into law it comprised the exclusion of leaseholders and several other improvements such as the admission of the occupiers of town parks to the act of and also the fixing of the judicial rent from the date of the application applause it appears to me to be positively absurd that a tenant who has applied to the court to fix a fair rent for him should be compelled to go on paying the old rack rent until the court is able to meet his case even though that case may not be reached for five or six years applause i think i may say that there can be very little doubt that this will be one of the improvements in the act which it would be possible to obtain in a short while from the legislature we then go to the subject of local self government and we claim the creation of county boards and the transfer to those boards of the fiscal and administrative powers of grand juries the boards to be elected on a representative system the abolition of the principle of nomination by government to membership of the following boards the local government board the board of works the general valuation and boundary survey the board of national education the reformatory and industrial schools board and the prisons board and the fishery board it has been said that the irish system of local government is the most beboarded sic system in the world it may also be said that it is the most centralised system in the world applause the whole of local government of the country is directed and carried on by permanent members of those central boards in dublin who are solely appointed by the government and most of whom i believe hold their offices during the pleasure of the government and upon leases of life so it happens that we have as the heads and members of many of these boards men who entered into office twenty or thirty years ago who are responsible to nobody who are saturated with all the old fashioned traditions of those days and who are now incapable of appreciating or understanding the spirit of modern progress which we now find in every direction cheers we propose to demand then that a clean sweep shall be made of those nominated boards and that the local government of the country both as regards its central source and as regards its local constitution in the counties should be put under the control of the elected representatives of the people of ireland applause the minor provisions such as transfer to the county boards of the management of the union workhouses lunatic asylums and other such institutions and winding up with the abolition of the office of lord lieutenant of ireland you will be able to read for yourselves i wish to say a word as to this question of the abolition of the office of lord lieutenant of ireland this office is usually filled by a nobleman who is a nonentity laughter so far as the practical duties of his office go or else by a nobleman who insists upon discharging all those duties himself and upon being responsible for the way in which the whole government of the country is administered in either case i think the principle is an exceedingly faulty and vicious one if we have a lord lieutenant who is a nonentity what is the use of him at all applause and if we have a lord lieutenant who practically looks after the duties of his own office we have an irresponsible person who is not subject to the judgment of the house of commons applause i have complained of this matter in the house of commons and i complain of it now i don't wish to introduce any personal reference or personal applications in discussing this question but at present we have the office filled by a nobleman of an exceedingly vigorous character who evidently considers that he is the only man entitled to take part in the government of this country and when we go over to london and as the elected representatives of the irish constituencies we ask questions in the house of commons we are answered by mr trevelyan the present chief secretary that he is unable to do anything himself but that he will refer the matter to the lord lieutenant cheers and it consequently happens that we have nobody in the house of commons whom we can get at cheers and laughter and whom we can question and make responsible for the government of this country so that in either case whether you have a nobleman of a retiring disposition or a nobleman of a vigorous character the principle is a faulty and vicious one and i for my part without going further into the greater and higher questions of the government of this country should earnestly desire that this anomalous office of lord lieutenant should be abolished and that until more radical reforms are carried out we should at least have the government of the country administered by an official like the chief secretary who is responsible to the house of commons a voice red indian harcourt mr parnell we also look forward to the extension of the parliamentary and municipal franchises and their assimilation to those of england and to this we look for much increase in the healthy political life of ireland until at all events a better system of registration is provided and the householders of the country are admitted to the franchise we can have but a very imperfect representation in the house of commons of the opinions of the people the irish parliamentary party are now but a fraction of ireland we comprise about out of the members ireland is entitled to send into the house of commons shame it is true that even under the present franchise we can hope largely to increase our present numbers at the next general election without altering at all the franchise we trust to increase our numbers to at least or and we then should at least constitute the majority of the irish representatives and not be under the imputation as at present that we are only a fraction or minority of that representation but to get such a representation as would secure for instance the creation of national self self government sic for ireland we require to return eighty or ninety members to the house of commons cheers and we cannot hope for this until the franchise has been lowered at least as far as the basis of household suffrage we have every hope that the next general election may be contested on that franchise and i feel sure that the irish people will secure some way of showing what their opinions are with regard to the great questions of the day and that no longer the irish party will be told that they are only a fraction of the irish representation we also claim separate legislation to elevate the condition of the agricultural labourers cheers and the co operation in the movement for fostering irish industries by appointing in connection with this branch of the organisation an industrial committee on which shopkeepers artisans and farmers shall have proportional representation we wish to assist as far as possible the exertions of the lord mayor cheers and the other gentlemen who have been so well and successfully carrying on the work of industrial revival we feel that very much may be done by the co operation of the shopkeepers artisans farmers and labourers of ireland in the practical work proposed by the formation of the new company of which the lord mayor is such a worthy head some rules are also added for the general guidance of an organising committee to be appointed for the purpose of organising a branch of the new organisation and of arranging the preliminaries of the conditions of the first election of the executive council this organising committee is to consist of five members of the mansion house committee for the relief of evicted tenants five members of the council of the house rule league and fifteen other gentlemen the organising committee is to have all the powers of the central council until the council is elected and no longer and now gentlemen before sitting down i wish to say a few words with regard to the observations which have been made in reference to the present position of our movement in america i feel bound to notice in the first place the remarks which have appeared in the english journals with regard to the character and class of our kindred beyond the sea who have subscribed to the struggle at home hear hear and which are distinguished by more than the usual degree of malignity and inaccuracy hear hear the american subscribers to the fund which has been of so much importance to our movement at home are described as the lowest of the classes of american population yet it is well known that our meetings there have been presided over or attended by governors of states bishops of the catholic church clergymen of all denominations senators congressmen judges the most eminent physicians and merchants of fortune and position applause large subscriptions have been given which could only come from men of large means in short our movement in america so far from being of the character described by the english press has been supported by all that is best socially amongst the people of irish origin it is represented that this support has been given on the condition of our obeying irish american dictation let me say in the most distinctive language i can employ that dictation has not been attempted by any responsible section of irish american opinion and that if it had been i would have felt it my duty on behalf of the irish nation at home to decline to obey it applause but all the speeches i have read of the most influential and representative irish americans while divergent on many other points were agreed on this that it was for the people at home and for the people at home only to choose the policy best adapted to obtain our national rights applause let me assure you that our movement there is not in that state of approaching chaos which the english journals would have us believe applause we have there a large and properly constituted organisation to all our people who are content with a practicable programme we confidently appeal for a continuance of that moral and material support which has so greatly helped us in the past cheers i wish to add my own opinion with regard to our position at home that notwithstanding the great disadvantages which we undoubtedly labour under by the addition to the penal legislation of this country of a coercion act unprecedented in its iniquity and stringency hear hear and hisses even in the annals of english coercion in ireland a coercion act under which the life the liberty and the property of no man is safe hear hear we shall be able to make even during the existence of that coercion act substantial and material progress applause and that at its termination we shall find that we have pushed the cause of ireland still nearer to a successful issue applause and that when these fetters of coercion shall have been struck from the limbs of ireland she will be in a position to rise and to demand the completion of those great measures of reform upon which the irish people have set their heart and which they are determined to obtain enthusiastic cheers i beg to move that this constitution of the new organisation be now adopted by this conference as the constitution of the new organisation applause i will call upon the rev father cantwell cheers to second the adoption of the constitution mr parnell i shall be glad to receive from any gentleman who desires to suggest alterations in the constitution of the organisation amendments in writing with the names and addresses of the proposers and seconders i think it would be desirable with a view to economise our time that we should now adopt the ten minutes rule with regard to speeches except by the special permission of the conference with regard to any particular speaker of course the general discussion is now open and i shall be glad to hear any gentleman who desires to address the conference if he comes to the platform a gentleman in the gallery made observations which were inaudible at the reporters table mr parnell the gentleman must come on the platform hear hear after an interval mr parnell said i find that the gentleman who desires to address the conference is only a visitor from england and is not a delegate he is not therefore entitled to address the conference mr parnell said i would ask the meeting to hear everybody cheers mr louden is perfectly entitled to a hearing in common with any other member of this conference and i would ask the meeting to hear him cheers groans and cries of we won't hear him mr parnell i do not think that the question is strictly a point of order hear hear of course in discussion upon a question of this kind such as that which has been submitted to the conference a speaker may find it necessary to make a personal attack in order to enforce his own views hear hear but at the same time i would put it to mr harrington whether he finds it necessary for the enforcement of the views he thinks it necessary to lay before the conference that he should continue his present line of argument hear hear i think it most undesirable to introduce those personal attacks upon individuals whether they are absent or present hear hear mr parnell what is the point of order mr parnell i think after mr davitt statement that any discussion about nationalisation of the land by the advocates of peasant proprietary unless the question is again brought forward by some advocates of nationalisation of the land is quite unnecessary hear hear mr parnell the procedure that i have adopted has been this that the adoption of the whole constitution has been put as one resolution and it is of course competent and in fact i have invited gentlemen to propose amendments to any portion of the constitution which will be taken seriatim at present two amendments are being taken upon article the first amendment proposed by mr harris is in substance that compulsory purchase as regards holdings not exceeding acres should be substituted for the optional system of purchase by agreement between landlord and tenant which our resolution proposes that is in the nature of an addition to the number of sub heads in article and he proposes a further addition with regard to the taxation of grazing farms mr parnell does any other gentleman wish to speak on these amendments then i had better put them to the conference and i should wish to say for myself that i would be very glad to accept the second of mr harris amendments that is with regard to the differentiation of taxation on grasslands i think such an amendment is an exceedingly valuable and practical one and it carries with it elements of justice and equity which must tend to recommend it to every man there is no doubt that it is absurd that a farmer occupying grassland and not spending anything on his land locking his gates in fact should only be taxed the same poundage upon the valuation of the land as the farmer who lives upon and tills his land and gives employment amongst the labourers i certainly think that the suggestion of mr harris in that direction is a most valuable one with regard to his other amendment i am sorry that i cannot agree to it because i think in the present stage of the land question and the present time and considering the present circumstances under which we exist in this country that it is unnecessary i believe that if the purchase clauses of the act of were amended in the direction that we propose in these resolutions landlords and tenants would agree amongst themselves with regard to the sale of their holdings and that as much of the land of ireland would pass into the possession of occupying tenants as the government would be willing to advance the money for as regards his objection to the extension of the period of purchase from years to years i would wish to explain how that will act supposing a tenant gets a judicial rent fixed under the land act as we hope to amend it and that that judicial rent is fixed we will say in the county cork at the poor law valuation and supposing he then agrees to purchase from his landlord and to give him the very large number of years purchase of the judicial rent under the system that we propose of spreading the period of redemption over years instead of years the tenant would have to pay per cent less than the judicial rent and he would become owner of his holding instead of paying the judicial rent for ever he would have to pay per cent less than the judicial rent for years and therefore the advantage of such a transaction is obvious to every comprehension in other words if a tenant judicial rent was fixed at a year under the amended tenure clauses of the act if be agreed to purchase his holding from his landlord he would be obliged to purchase that holding by paying in instalments of a a sic year for years and be a gainer as regards his annual payment by a year and also by looking forward to its termination the entire cessation of payment at the end of years the system that we propose is one which is so mutually advantageous both to the tenant and the landlord that if we could get the legislature to accept it i confidently believe that it would not be necessary to put compulsion upon the landlord to sell or to adopt the principle of compulsory purchase so therefore i say let us wait and see whether the landlords will sell voluntarily under the amended system that we propose if they would not be willing to sell voluntarily i would be willing to go in for compulsory powers applause mr harris still desires to have his first amendment as regards compulsion versus a voluntary arrangement put to the conference and having expressed my opinion with regard to the matter and having stated that i think it would be more judicious and advisable for us not to adopt the system of compulsion as present it now becomes my duty to put this question to the conference the question that you will have to decide on i will put to you in this shape compulsion versus non compulsion all who are in favour of mr harris first amendment of compulsion will say aye some ayes the contrary no loud cries of no i think the noes have it laughter and applause the next amendment of mr harris is one to which i agree and i will put it to the meeting the addition of sub head e article ii in the following terms the levying of taxes now raised off all farming land upon grass land and that said taxes should be graduated so as to put the greater part of the burden of large farms and then sub head f the breaking of all covenants compelling tenants not to till their holdings mr c s parnell m p before the amendment which has been moved by mr rylett is put i should like to put the conference in possession of the reasons which weighed upon us when we were drafting this constitution for the choice of as the number of elected members in the future council mr rylett amendment proposes to give to each county the right of choosing one member of the council this was a suggestion which came before us and which we very carefully considered and we dismissed it for this reason that we felt that there are many counties in ireland which would not be entitled to as many representatives on the executive council as many other counties for instance the county of cork or the county tipperary with perhaps branches each in the new organisation and members would naturally be entitled to a larger representation than the county of down with perhaps five branches and or members it was our endeavour to leave to the organising committee for the organisation as far as we have drafted it does not form any electoral districts but it was our intention to leave to the organisation committee the task of forming equal electoral districts as far as it is possible to form them so that the new council should be the representatives of the constituencies if you take a county as the electoral unit you will have a very uneven unit varying from cork or tipperary with a very large number of branches at all and very few members in fixing upon the number of we were guided by this consideration that any larger executive would be entirely too unwieldy now as regards mr metge objection to giving the irish parliamentary party the right of electing the members upon this new body the consideration which influences us in recommending that provision was shortly this that unless we adopted some such provision as that if we allowed the irish members to be eligible for nomination and election in the various counties that in many of the counties perhaps in the majority of the counties represented by the irish parliamentary party the real irish parliamentary party it might happen that those members would probably be elected as being the most prominent men and the men most before the public the men whose names were most in the minds and ears of the public and exceedingly useful men for representation on the central council would be left out in the cold take the case of my friend mr metge own constituency supposing he was eligible for election on this central council would it not be probable almost certain that the people of meath would elect him as their representative on the central council since they have also undoubtedly elected him as their member to the house of commons a voice and a good member too mr parnell and it consequently would happen that some man in meath who was not a member of parliament but whom it was most essential to have on the council would be shut out and the country deprived of his services we therefore adopted the arrangement which has been placed before you in the programme as one that would secure the most substantial justice the fullest representation of the people and be attended with the greatest convenience applause mr parnell this question of north v south has been raised it certainly never was intended that the north should be deprived of its proper representation there are many counties in the north of ireland which are just as thoroughly entitled to representation as any county in the south and as we had intended originally and as we had expressed it in one of the drafts of our constitution it was provided that five out of twenty members should be given to each province so that ulster munster leinster and connaught should each have five after consideration it was thought it would be better to leave it to the committee i observe that there is a strong feeling on the part of the northern members there is no doubt that the nationalists of the north of ireland have made great exertions in the national cause cheers i am perfectly willing that it should be in the constitution that each province should have five members on this council but what i wish to carry out as a thoroughly democratic principle is that the branches shall be represented and if our suggestion were adopted and five members given to each province it would be the duty of the organising committee to direct that these five members should be elected by the north of ireland but not necessarily by counties if that meets the views of the members from the north perhaps a solution may in that way be arrived at mr parnell i am not quite sure whether mr rylett resolution was withdrawn according to my recollection of it the withdrawal was not put formally to the meeting but i think it would be proper of me now that i should put formally to the meeting is it your pleasure that mr rylett resolution be withdrawn applause mr parnell i think that the course which has been adopted by mr davitt is a very great honour to him rather than stand in the way of a harmonious conclusion to our proceedings and finding that the principle for which he contended namely a county representation having each county represented a principle i confess to which i was opposed and am still opposed has been conceded he has withdrawn the latter part of his resolution which proposed to deny any representation except in the ordinary way of election to the parliamentary party i am glad that he has done so because i think that if this meeting had decided that the irish parliamentary party was not worthy of being entrusted with the nomination of members of this council it would have been taken by the world as a vote of want of confidence hear hear mr t p o'connor yes and that is all i said mr parnell i know that mr davitt did not so intend it i accept to the fullest extent the declaration he has made and that he only wished that that principle of representation should be carried out in its integrity it now becomes my duty to put mr meany amendment that the council consist of forty eight members thirty two to be elected by the county conventions and sixteen by the irish parliamentary party mr parnell in reply to mr o'donnell question i wish to say that if he had taken the trouble to read the programme which has been placed in the hands of all the members of this conference he would have seen that under the rules it is provided that members of parliament are ineligible for election by a county convention hear hear mr parnell in declaring the proceedings of this conference at an end i have to thank you both for the number of your attendance and the orderly character and demeanour of the meeting it has given me a great deal of pleasure and it has been a very great honour to me indeed to preside over this conference to day i can recollect when we formed the irish national land league we had only a meeting of or people in a back parlour in the imperial hotel and this new organisation is starting under very much more advantageous auspices owing to the character of the attendance here to day of course ireland has made great strides in the interval and we shall go now to the work of this new organisation to a certain extent to a considerable extent instructed by the experience of the past and i trust that the result of our labours may prove as successful and as fortunate for the people of ireland as the labours of the irish national land league were cheers\n",

      "at a banquet in his honour in the evening mr parnell on rising was received with loud and continued cheering he said mr mayor ladies and gentlemen the toast of prosperity to ireland will i hope and i am pleased to be able to hope shortly find an exemplification in the city of cork by the establishment of a national exhibition cheers it is fit that the southern city should be the first to follow the example which was set in dublin and i am happy also in believing that the example of dublin in refusing to permit the establishment of a national exhibition to be used by any political party cheers for the purpose of advancing its partisan views will also be followed in cork cheers but as regards politics the national exhibition to be held in cork will absolutely be mutual no party should be allowed to have any advantage over the other hear hear as regards this exhibition it is entirely for the purpose of advancing the welfare of the city of cork and to contribute to the prosperity and happiness of the labouring and industrial classes of the country cheers since i last had the honour of addressing you many events have happened for my part as i said to the people at the great meeting held this afternoon i have not to confess any alteration in my feelings you will recollect that the occasion of my last visit to the city of cork was just before i was honoured with a warrant or rather an invitation to visit kilmainham by mr forster hear hear i then advised the adoption by the tenant farmers of the policy of test cases for the purpose of testing the working of the land act and in order that the standard of rent which the land commission would be likely to fix might be ascertained by the simple process of submitting two or three of such test cases on each estate many thousands of pounds would have been saved in fact i may say probably a hundred thousand pounds would have been saved to all parties to this question both the government the landlords and the tenants if it had been possible that my advice should have been systematically followed but the brutal action of the government in arresting all the members of the central executive of the land league and in practically prohibiting that organization by arresting local leaders also throughout the country and by arresting everybody connected with it down to the very clerks in the office in dublin rendered it impossible for us to carry out that course of action and another and different line of action involved in the no rent manifesto was forced upon the country hear hear the wisdom of the advice with regard to the test cases which was given by the convention has been admitted by the commissioners themselves in their report which has just been laid before parliament in which the very words that i repeatedly used with regard to the standard of rent set up by the decisions of the court were used by the commissioners themselves which standard they say has been of vast service in enabling tenants and landlords to come to agreement outside the court hear hear i am not one of those who ever believed that the tenants of ireland would refuse to pay rent at the outset i never supposed that the policy of no rent would do more than effect good indirectly in causing tenants to obtain large abatements from the landlords under the pressure of the threat to pay no rent hear hear i believe that this view has been signally justified by the results of the last months and that on the whole most beneficial results for the irish people were obtained during the struggle of last winter although this struggle undoubtedly caused sacrifices and sufferings to some individuals as we watched the course of the battle from kilmainham prison cheers and i can assure you we watched it with considerable anxiety it became evident to us in the month of february in the view of the vast majority of the estates in ireland accepting reductions offered to them after the pressure of the manifesto by the landlords which was the most i had ever supposed could be obtained from the manifesto i became evident that we had attained to the reopening of the land question and to the admission by the government that the healy clause of the land act required amendment we had further at this time in february obtained a probability of receiving an arrears act for the purpose of protecting the interests of the smaller and more impoverished tenants acting upon these views and seeing that the utmost that could possibly be obtained from the manifesto had been gained these members of the executive who were in kilmainham gaol cheers decided that it would be desirable not to circulate the manifesto any longer in fact to withdraw it from circulation accordingly about the end of february we decided that tenants should not be dissuaded from accepting advantageous settlements we found means of communicating our views to those who were in charge of the movement outside who agreed to carry out our conclusion and i believe took steps to carry it out in the month of february then the manifesto was practically withdrawn in may we were released from kilmainham and had it not been for the unhappy phoenix park tragedy that then occurred there would be no more coercion for ireland and the government would have invited parliament to take up again irish legislation and proceed with the other reforms of vast importance to the interest of the people of this country the event in phoenix park however considerably altered matters and then parliament occupied itself by the passage of a coercion act of unexampled barbarity and in the passage of an arrears act which was maimed in its passage owing to three alterations inserted contrary to our protest and advice those three alterations were the hanging gale proviso which has lately been the subject of an important judgment by the whole court of the land commission the question of the costs payable by the tenants who had been ejected or against whom judgment for the recovery of rent had been obtained and the third the limitation of the time within which the tenant might pay rent in respect of but notwithstanding the injury done to the arrears act by these three alterations an injury which i am happy to say in the case of the hanging gale proviso has been obviated by the clumsiness of the draftsman failing to carry out the intentions of the government i say it is now certain that the arrears act will do a considerable amount of good to the small tenants of the country upwards of of them will most possibly obtain more or less of benefit from this proviso and of arrears will very probably be wiped off from the irish tenants cheers in so far as this arrears act has been a success it has been because the government in its original draft consulted men who understood the wants and requirements of the situation and in so far as it has been a failure it is because they deviated from the advice given them and went counter to the suggestions of those who were acquainted with the practical circumstances of the case during the whole course of this land movement i have felt bound to point out to the irish tenants that a bill for fixing a fair rent by means of a court must inevitably fail to satisfy them for many reasons the chief of which was that it would probably break down by its own weight and by the inherent difficulty of its working but one clause which was contained in the rent fixing sections of the act of induced me to hope that some good might be obtained for the irish tenants out of this rent fixing clause i refer to that part of the bill which is known as the healy clause three cheers for healy an interruption took place at this point and the person who caused it was ejected from the room mr parnell resuming said as the celebrated clause was passed originally in the house of commons at the instance of the hon member for wexford it ran as follows no rent shall be allowed or made payable in any proceedings under this act in respect of any improvement made by the tenant or his predecessors in title as that section left the house of commons it was a most important one for the tenants of ireland unfortunately as a compromise with the house of lords the following addition was made to it on its return to the commons for which in the opinion of the court the tenant or his predecessors in title shall not have been paid or otherwise compensated by the landlord or by his predecessors in title this addition made by the lords practically destroyed the clause and rendered it of very little value whatever for the protection of the tenant improvements but in addition to this alteration a judgment was given by the supreme court of appeal in the case of adams v dunseath which had the further effect of utterly destroying any good which might still be left in the clause as it was finally enacted in the act to show you the practical effect of the interpretation in adams v dunseath i have only to tell you that in the judicial rents fixed up to the end of january before the judgment was delivered the average reduction amounted to ½ per cent but since the judgment was given the amount of reduction every month has shown a steady fall until in the month of august it only amounted to per cent showing a loss to the tenants of one third of the reductions which they were getting before the judgment in adams v dunseath the court has practically decided that the landlord notwithstanding the healy clause is entitled to rent on the tenant improvements under several sets of conditions one or other of such sets of conditions applies in the case of almost every tenancy to which the act applies they have decided first that where at any time the tenant held under lease the improvements made by him before the commencement of the lease belong to the landlord and not to the tenant and that rent can be exacted on these improvements they have decided secondly that the landlord is entitled to rent on the tenant improvements effected during the lease other than permanent buildings and reclamation of waste land thirdly they have decided that the landlord is entitled to rent on improvements effected previously to the passing of the act of fourthly they have decided that to the landlord belongs what they call the improvable capability of the land that the landlord is entitled to rent on the tenant improvements made under any other circumstances which may be hereafter made except to the extent of per cent on the capital actually expended by the tenant in making these improvements the effect therefore of this decision is that in a very limited class of cases where the tenant improvements are protected they are only protected to the extent of per cent on the capital expended it may be that the improvements add per cent the landlord will get per cent and the tenant will get only per cent cheers the absurdity of this reading of the healy clause will be evident to you by an example of a case where a tenant borrows money from the board of works to improve his holding under the provisions of the land act of supposing a tenant borrows to improve his holding under the provisions of the act he will have to pay to the board of works an annual instalment of ½ per cent for interest and principal he expends that we will say in improving his holding and perhaps this expenditure increases the letting value of the holding by a year after he has made the improvement and spent the money which he borrowed from the board of works he applies to the court to fix a fair rent the landlord then comes in and according to the construction which has been placed upon the healy clause the landlord is entitled to claim a year additional rent for the expended by the tenant and the tenant has only a year left to pay the 10s a year interest and principal to the board of works cheers so that by taking the trouble to borrow loan from the board of works to spend it in draining and improving his land he gets this that he has to pay 10s a year more than he had to pay before it may be said that this renders it undesirable for tenants to improve their holdings now i do not think so and later on i intend to urge on everybody the desirability of trying to induce the tenants to borrow money from the board of works for the purpose of improving their holdings in order that they may afford employment to the labouring classes during this winter because if one thing is more certain than another it is this that before a very long time has gone by we shall have restored the healy clause to its original integrity and we shall have smashed pulverized and confounded the judgment of the court in adams v dunseath apart from the inherent justice of our claim that this question of the healy clause should be settled in such a way as to secure to the tenant that he shall have for himself his heirs and those who come after him the increased letting value added to his holding by himself we have mr gladstone repeated declarations in the course of the debate on the present land act to the same effect these declarations go entirely counter to the judgment and to every point of the judgment in adams v dunseath i do not like to take up the time of gentlemen who wish to hear more eloquent and more attractive speakers than myself no no yet perhaps i may be allowed to read to you one or two extracts from speeches delivered by mr gladstone during the passage of the land act in the session of on the 9th of august he said in the act of we did in respect of the tenant recognize the principle that he might be compensated by reasonable lapse of time in respect of improvements and that the use and profits of those improvements for a certain length of time might be considered as compensation but we do not recognize that in the principle of the present act further on he said the main ground on which i stand is that we do not recognize the principle of compensation by enjoyment for a certain length of time either as regards the landlord or the tenant it is much better i think that those who make the improvements should have the whole benefit of the improvements that is our claim hear hear on the 10th of august mr gladstone said the effect of that clause as it was then altered would be that the tenant should have the benefit of his improvements no matter how long ago they had been made wherever he was able to prove that he had made them on the same evening in opposing the amendment of sir stafford northcote that the court should take into consideration the time during which he had enjoyed the improvements mr gladstone said that the doctrine accepted at the time of the land act of was the doctrine that the enjoyment by the tenant for a certain length of time of his own improvements might reimburse him for those improvements and by an annual process the might pass over to the landlord but that was not the basis on which they now proposed to act there was no occasion for it the tenant improvements were the tenants sic own property and he would not admit the principle that the time during which he enjoyed those improvements was any reason for their passing away from him now the court in the judgment in adams v dunseath has admitted those principles against the tenant which mr gladstone in the extracts i have just read refused to admit the house divided on sir stafford northcote amendment and there was a majority of against the amendment now mr mayor ladies and gentlemen this question of improvements is of vital importance to the tenants of ireland it was as i have said the only section of the rent fixing clauses which gave you any hope that this clause was to be of any advantage to the irish people hear hear we have been cheated out of the clause by the chicanery of the courts in dublin cheers from the very moment that it was passed the conservative majority of the supreme court in dublin set their heads to work to drive a coach and six through the section and unfortunately they have only been too successful so far in doing so for the rents fixed by the sub commission court under the judgment are one third less than the reductions before the judgment practically speaking the landlords of ireland have made no improvement in the land of ireland hear hear all the improvements have been made by the tenants improvements whether we stop short at a certain point or whether we go back to what has been called the prairie value i say it is our duty to obtain a settlement of this great question as soon as we can cheers in the recognition by the courts and by the legislature that the tenants must be dealt with fairly another matter in connexion with the land act is the exclusion of the leaseholders there are leaseholders in ireland holding probably among them ¼ millions of acres of some of the best land in the country these leaseholders so far as the land act of is concerned are placed absolutely at the mercy of the landlords because they have no mercy whatever to expect from the land act cheers there is no reason or logic whatever in that exclusion of these men i say that leaseholders are as much entitled to the benefits of the land act as any other tenants in ireland cheers another difficulty is the duty of fixing the judicial rents as the land act was originally approved the judicial rent was to date from the decision of the courts if there is anything that would tend to the settlement out of court between landlord and tenant as to what the fair rent should be it is certain that it should date from the application of the tenant but how has it worked practically speaking the courts are blocked they cannot reach the cases and the landlord is in this position that until the rent has been fixed he can compel the tenants to pay old rent the number of applications from the irish tenants which came within the act up to the end of last month amounted to and the number of judicial rents fixed out of these applications amounted to and odd of the remainder only a small proportion can be heard for several years it is preposterous to expect that the landlords would agree to any concession unless they were acted upon by some force superior to that of the land act i believe that if the little alteration of making the rent date from the date of the application were inserted the landlord would know there would be no use in compelling the tenants to pay a rack rent hear hear during the months the act has been working the total reduction of rents amounts to i should like to know what reductions the tenant farmers have obtained during the two years of the land league agitation cheers i think you would say that it would be only a small benefit if we only got in months of agitation cheers according to the opinions of our officials i believe that since the commencement of the agitation we have succeeded in obtaining reductions not including the of arrears which i hope will not be wiped out by the arrears act amounting to quite for the tenantry of ireland cheers so that if you try the case of the land act versus italics the defunct land league i am afraid the case of the land act will have to go to the wall even though it is a legislative enactment hear hear now to obtain this reduction of the tenants have had to pay to the lawyers fully in costs and the landlords probably another in costs and the government to try the cases so that in order to obtain this miserable reduction both by the action of the court and with any agreement out of court an expenditure of was incurred it will be a liberal assumption to make that for the future the courts counting the cases that will be settled by voluntary agreement will be able to fix about cases of judicial rents in a year and consequently it would take years at the present rate of progress to fix the rents of tenants and it would cost to the parties interested the sum of sterling the inducements then to the landlord to refuse settlement out of court is this point that he is entitled to go on charging the old rent until the new rent is fixed and as in the vast majority of cases the new rents will not be fixed for ten years the landlord has a statutory or unstatutory sic term of the old rack rent far as the land act is concerned we all recognize that any attempts to amend rack rents by fixing clauses cannot go to the root of the question the rent of the irish tenant must be reduced in order to lead up to an occupying ownership in order to obtain that satisfactory tenure under which the soil can be cultivated with the best advantage namely an occupying ownership or peasant proprietary the rack rents must be reduced before we proceed to ask for the amendment of the purchases clauses so that the transfer of estates from the landlords to the tenants may have some chance of being practically carried out cheers i believe that this can be done and that it would be no loss to the british taxpayer hear hear englishmen might say that irish tenants would refuse to pay back the advance and what an awkward position the state would then be in if the irish tenants refused to pay i say it would not be in nearly so awkward a position as the state was in when enforcing rents at the point of the bayonet and employing the naval and military forces of the crown knowing as it must have known that it was enforcing unjust rents cheers the claims of the labourers require immediate attention i know of no class in ireland who have suffered as much and so patiently as the irish labourers cheers it is enough to make one heart bleed as one passes through the poorer streets of the cities of ireland or when you see the little cabins of the labourers on the roadside of the country districts and when you see how wretchedly they are housed and fed it is a perfect wonder that so large a body should have borne their grievances so patiently and it is absolutely necessary that those who are interested in the future of ireland should recognize their duty in this respect cheers we can do something in parliament but it is necessary that you should agitate and organize in the country it is necessary that you should subscribe to the funds for the evicted tenants and it is necessary that you should support the irish national league and show the government that you are determined to gain your just rights cheers if there should be a diminution of agrarian crime in ireland during this year which i fervently hope there may be if the country remains tranquil as it is now and if in the next session of parliament the government refuse legislation to the irish people then i say it will be a declaration to the irish people that what has been often said is true it has often been said that you have to bring ireland to a state bordering on revolution in order to obtain justice for her mr forster said the other day that it was not on account of the land league agitation that parliament had passed the land act if it was not on account of these things would mr forster and the english parliament show next session that they are strong enough to legislate for ireland justly or rightly without such things but if they do not a voice we will fight if they do not do this it will be a sign that mr forster and these other englishmen who talk in this way are not speaking the truth to meet the distress which unhappily may have already fallen on a portion of our country it has been proposed that a certain section of the irish tenants should withhold payment from the landlords of six months rent hear hear and allocate a portion of the rent to meet the distress of the poorer tenants in these parts of ireland with that suggestion i am sorry to say i cannot agree because i do not think it would be a practicable one the tenants last winter showed that they would not withhold their rent but that they would pay a fair rent and i do not think therefore that it is desirable we should try the no rent issue over again and i only mention this in order that i may bring before you my own suggestion first the immediate granting of powers to boards of guardians to grant outdoor relief and tenant farmers for the purpose of enabling them to improve their holdings it is surely not too much to ask that to the board of guardians in ireland should be granted the same powers that they have in england even the conservative government in without waiting for parliament to sanction their action permitted the giving of outdoor relief and authorized loans to the landlords surely it is not too much to ask the present liberal government to do as well as lord beaconsfield and jemmy lowther cheers certainly if they do refuse this i think the irish electors of liverpool who disregarded the advice of their leaders will have reason to regret the christmas box they sent to mr gladstone in the election when they find that the only requital he gives them is the restriction of relief to the indoor system of the workhouse which our people would rather die than enter the local government board has issued a circular in which they declare they will not sanction the granting of outdoor relief well perhaps the local government board may see reason to change their mind another strange fallacy on which the government seem to rely in dealing with these questions is the proposition for emigration inserted in the arrears act they think such is the ignorance of lord spencer and mr trevelyan of every practical proposal connected with irish questions they think they can take these pauper families on a moment notice and transport them bodily to new york at a head lord derby thinks indeed that it would pay england very well to invest millions in this business all i can say is that if relief of distress could have been coped with by emigration from ireland we ought never to have emigration again mr forster hisses who has had the advantage of being in this country hisses well i am not sure that we should hiss the poor old gentleman i am not at all so sure that lord spencer is at all so good an exchange for him we must always remember that lord spencer was sent over to help mr forster before the change in the government was determined on mr forster says he does not rely too much on emigration and that if he had remained in office he intended to recommend the government to spend public money liberally in works of public improvement in ireland perhaps we were too hard on mr forster and it might have been better if we had tolerated him for a while longer mr tuke who is interesting himself in this question of emigration has a way of proceeding which is very satisfactory so far as it goes on a small scale he emigrates a certain number of families to america and makes provision for those families on landing he finds that they have friends in america who will take care of them for the first year or he obtains employment for them and puts them in a position in which they will be able to get a start but such a plan from the very nature of the case must be limited to the extent of ground which it covers it would be be sic utterly impossible that or families whom it would be necessary to lift from the congested districts in the west of ireland in order to relieve that congestion and to relieve periodical famines could be located in america or any other country on the system proposed by mr tuke by an expenditure of per head it would take more than that and i will always oppose to the best of my ability any attempt on the part of the government or anybody else to land these unfortunate creatures in a helpless and penniless condition on the shores of the eastern states of america cheers if england desires to emigrate our people let them be emigrated in a respectable way england is rich enough to do it let them be placed on land in america let them have houses furnished them to cover their heads during the first winter after their arrival and let them be furnished with the means of raising a crop in the first year of their residence and then we will talk to the government but we have always advocated another means of relieving these congested districts i may take some pride to myself for having been perhaps the first to point out to the world that in ireland there is plenty of land for the purpose of settling these families cheers according to the gardener chronicle italics there are acres of land in ireland in the occupation of large graziers which urgently require to be broken up in order to prevent them from lapsing into a state of nature cheers these lands were peopled before the famine and there is no reason why they should not be peopled again cheers it would entail but a small expenditure to compensate the graziers for whatever rights they may have in these lands but in any case i say that they have no right to hold them they could be purchased from the landlords at a comparatively small price it would enable the tenants to be emigrated to them and to live upon them in comfort by the only means in which it can be easily done in the circumstances cheers if the government really desire to meet this difficulty they can only properly meet it in this way they can increase the production of food and they can give employment to many thousands of our people who are now starving and if they persist in their ideas of workhouse or emigration and refuse to consider the views which we have placed before them they will show that their desire is not the happiness and prosperity of the irish people but the extermination of that people cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who on coming forward was received with cheers said electors and non electors of cork i can assure you that if affords me the greatest pleasure and pride to find myself once more among my fellow citizens you have honoured me to day and the speakers who have addressed you have honoured me in a most exceptional way i cannot be so vain as to suppose for a moment that any of this praise and any of this honour which you have showered upon me is my due a voice it is i know that it is not on account of your estimate of my personal worth or ability that you thus assemble to greet me but rather because you believe that i have held firm to those principles to which i first pledged myself on the plains of royal meath in cheers to which i afterwards renewed my pledges in this city before you in it is because you believe that i have done my best to help the suffering people of ireland because you think that i have held fast by the doctrines independent of opposition and independent of both english political parties so long as these parties refuse to recognize the just rights of ireland the doctrines which were first preached in ireland by duffy and by dillon doctrines which were enunciated in this city by joseph ronayne the doctrines which he taught me and which i laid before you at the last general election it was because of your believing that i would faithfully carry out these pledges that you elected me and i am proud to think to day after my seven years of political service that i can examine my heart and find that my mind is unchanged i think to day and i thought when i addressed the people of meath in and please god though it may take many or few years to gain your just rights i trust so long as life may be spared to me that i shall still think and believe as you think and believe and as you wish me to think and believe and that i may always have that generous confidence and support in difficult times which you have never failed to give me for which gentlemen standing here i have to accord you my humblest and best thanks and appreciation and now i do not know whether the city of cork has been proclaimed under the curfew act a voice no but as i have no doubt that many of you come from the country and you will have to return to your homes it is a dangerous thing for anybody to be seen listening to or associating with an ex suspect laughter i shall dismiss you to your homes and ask you to continue to aid us in our struggles and i pledge myself in return assisted as i have been by gentlemen of eminent ability of wonderful self sacrifice and devotion that we shall endeavour in those lines of action still open to us so long as we have your confidence and support to work for ireland as we have done in the past without flinching without sparing ourselves and without fear cheers mr parnell in reply said he was among those who regretted that the hastily prepared scheme and imperfect proposals embodied in the royal university bill were accepted while the late government were in office if those charged with the care of university education had waited a while they would have obtained a much more perfect settlement of the question and one more in accordance with the feelings and traditions of the irish people he promised to do all in his power to rectify the grievances they complained of he was astonished at their being forbidden to take part in political matters as the students in english colleges were allowed to do so and in this way they received a high political education were trained for debate and fitted to become statesmen in after life\n",

      "mr parnell cork i wish to say a word on two of the questions on the treatment of ordinary prisoners and also on the question of the treatment of political prisoners and i shall deal with the case of ordinary prisoners first i have long thought that the treatment of ordinary prisoners in both english and irish gaols is radically wrong and based on false principles if i were to be asked to define the best system for the occupation and discipline of convicted prisoners i should say just the reverse of that which you adopt in ireland in ireland you provide prisoners with the only work which your prison rules sanction that is the work of picking oakum that is a badly paid work and consequently in many cases you cannot even find enough of this work for the prisoners to do you make up for that by half starving them you reduce the allowance of bread which they get to the smallest point at which this allowance is capable of sustaining life with the result that the prisoner who serves two years imprisonment with hard labour we have it on the authority of an eminent irish judge is always permanently enfeebled in either body or mind as the result of the punishment and very often permanently enfeebled in both my view of the way in which a prisoner should be treated is this that you should provide him with plenty of reproductive work to do and you should give him sufficient food and food of a proper quality to enable him to do that work properly i do not see why prisoners instead of being a cost to the state as they are especially in ireland should not be a profit to the state i do not see why you should make up for your want of employment for the prisoners in irish prisons by half starving them and by torturing them on the plank bed there is no reason why without inflicting any hardship upon the unemployed labour of the country you should not find remunerative employment for the small number of prisoners which exist in irish prisons employment which would be remunerative to the state which would save the state the cost of supporting prisoners and which would be of some advantage to the community at large instead of that you set them to work to pick oakum and to do other work which is no profit whatever to the state or to the prisoners you enfeeble them in body and mind by starvation by confinement under unsanitary conditions and by a system of rigorous silence which is unnatural and barbarous i would say regarding prisoners under short terms of imprisonment that is to say prisoners sent for terms of not more than two years you ought most largely to imitate the system in vogue in your long term prisons in this country and adopted in the penal servitude prisons of finding employment for the prisoners in the open air upon reproductive works which would benefit the community at large and the practical result of which would be seen let me say a word as to the condition of criminal prisoners in ireland i have said that i believe these prisoners are systematically half starved and i am convinced of that i have myself examined the condition of many of these men i have seen men go into prison strong active and robust countrymen who have come out weak pale and emaciated broken down in spirit and with their bodies enfeebled as the result of terms of imprisonment of months months and two years i do not believe sir that it is necessary for the maintenance of prison discipline and for effecting the reform which everybody desires in the minds of the prisoners convicted of offences that they should be half starved or browbeaten or that their minds should become enfeebled but these are the results of your present system i believe a better and more humane system could be adopted by which you could better ensure the end you have in view the reformation of the minds of these criminals and which would result in some advantage and benefit to the community at large it is not advisable to slowly torture prisoners and induce disease under the pretext of reforming their minds and making them useful members of the community let me refer to the condition of the prisons themselves i am convinced that none of the older prisons in ireland are fit for human beings to live in and you have a remarkable example of this in the case of kilmainham that is composed partly of the old and partly of the new building we heard from the right hon gentleman to night that it was impossible to put up sheds in the exercise grounds for prisoners to exercise in on wet days i admit it but the right hon gentleman did not tell us as he might have done that all modern prisons are provided with spacious halls in which prisoners can exercise on wet days under as complete surveillance as if exercising in the open yards that is the case with the prison at kilmainham in the modern portion there is a large hall well lighted well ventilated and well warmed in which there is abundant room for or prisoners to exercise on a wet day with sufficient room and the cells of this modern portion are properly ventilated and drained and there is no fault to be found with them from the sanitary point of view but if you go across the dividing line between the old prison and the new you get into a portion of the prison which is unsanitary from top to bottom there is instead of being modern drains the old style of drains built of bricks infested with rats leaking at every pore and from these leakages the sewer gas escapes into the cells of the unfortunate prisoners above and whence liquid drainage leaks into the foundations of the prison and forms a constant source of fever and disease you find the cells themselves damp and almost uninhabitable so badly ventilated that when any attempt is made to warm them they become furnaces and when the furnaces go out they become deadly cold the sewers leak and fill the whole building with sewer gas many of the sewers discharge themselves under the exercise yard and periodically burst up and flood these yards with the sewage matter i have myself been a witness of this i have frequently seen the main sewer of the old portion of the prison at kilmainham burst into the exercise yard and flood it to such an extent as to make it impossible for it to be used for exercise for many days together and i believe this must be the case with every old fashioned prison in ireland that they are not sanitary and could not be improved and that nothing would effect any sufficient reform in the condition of these old prisons and buildings except a thorough pulling down and rebuilding of them upon modern principles and i am convinced this must be the case with derry prison i am convinced that you have there an old prison not capable of reform on sanitary principles and the result is these mysterious cases of fever arise which the prison doctor attempts to put down as tuberculosis it seizes not one but four or five different prisoners surely this should give rise to very grave cause for inquiry as to the sanitary condition of derry gaol we know that there is nothing so terrible in modern maladies as typhoid fever that it is an insidious disease and that it creeps on without notice or warning and that the unfortunate patient is past hope before his medical attendant knows he is ill the right hon gentleman has displayed a lamentable culpability with regard to the lives of political and ordinary criminals confined in derry gaol his attention was called to this matter by the unhappy deaths of two prisoners and by the sudden and alarming illness of several others and he has neglected up to the present moment to send a proper sanitary engineer to inquire into the condition of this prison it is absurd to excuse himself under the plea that he has sent dr o'farrell it is dr o'farrell duty to know all about it without any further visit or inspection it is a condemnation of dr o'farrell if it turn out that this prison is unsanitary and unfit for the reception of prisoners is it likely that dr o'farrell even if he had the engineering knowledge requisite which is exceedingly doubtful would pass upon himself his own condemnation by admitting that this prison is anything else but in the most perfect sanitary condition i am glad to hear that mr conybeare is to be removed from this pest house but while we rejoice on behalf of mr conybeare let us not forget the more humble victims still left and who have still to fear this lurking pest beneath the floors of their cells and who may be stricken down at any moment the right hon gentleman must not leave other unfortunate victims to die in this horrible place i do trust that before the vote is disposed of the right hon gentleman will give us some assurance that the very best scientific skill the very best engineering skill that can be obtained of an independent character will at once without the loss of another hours be employed to inspect this horrible hole and that the truth will at once be laid before the country and that the report if it be in condemnation of this place will be acted upon at once and that prisoners of all kinds political or otherwise will be removed to some healthy place now i come to the question of political prisoners it is a curious thing but not the less true that only in this country have there been exceptional rules regulations and privileges embodied in statute form for the benefit of political prisoners why is this this exceptional care on the part of the legislature has been forced upon the legislature from time to time by the barbarous treatment of political prisoners in ireland it is usually sufficient and it is always understood in every country that political prisoners are to have exceptional treatment in the old time political prisoners got exceptional treatment they received privileges and lenient treatment which were not the lot of persons convicted of gross crimes and the executive of the day had always forced upon it by public opinion this duty and necessity of taking care that the incidence of punishment should not fall harshly upon political prisoners it has never been necessary for the legislature to interfere and to point out to the executive its duty in this matter except in the case of irish political prisoners and this change was only forced upon the legislature in owing to the barbarous treatment meted out to the fenian political prisoners in and subsequent years by the home secretary who had the responsibility in those days these men were taken from all ranks in life after conviction in ireland they were brought over to the english convict prisons they were deliberately stripped of their flannels in the depth of winter and the gaol flannels were refused to them it is to me inconceivable that this should have been so but it stands so it stands upon record in the report of the devon commission they were ill treated in many other ways because being fenians they were unpopular with all classes in england and they were a special mark for the vindictiveness and petty spite of the gaolers in the convict prisons who had charge of them many of them lost their lives many of them permanently lost their health and subsequently died from disease contracted in these prisons some became paralysed i myself saw in an unfortunate man named neill who has since died and who was then dying in loughlins town workhouse and unable to move hand or foot he had to be wheeled about in a chair as a pauper in this workhouse he had been accused of malingering his paralysis was asserted by the government to be feigned most cruel tests were applied to him and he was discharged finally but too late to arrest the course of the paralysis which had seized him and he died about a year afterwards others of them became insane and few more terrible histories can be written than the history of many of these unfortunate men engaged in the fenian conspiracy and who suffered terribly owing to the harshness and rigor of the prison treatment meted out to them all these matters were brought before the parliament of and to the honour of mr cross the then home secretary be it said he admitted the principle in the prisons act of that year of the exceptional treatment of political prisoners and a clause was inserted providing that persons convicted of sedition and seditious libel should be treated as misdemeanants of the first division that i think was the first at all events it was the most remarkable legislative recognition of the right of political prisoners to special and different treatment it was the recognition which came from a conservative home secretary and which came from a conservative government and it was very much to their honour that they passed that into law and it was also the condemnation of previous governments action which was used as an illustration of the necessity for the reform then obtained but the right hon gentleman seeks to turn back the hands of the clock he wants to go back has gone back in his treatment of political prisoners to the old bad times of the right hon gentleman may hope that he is to some extent successful in intimidating his political opponents by harshness but he i think will find in the long run that he is sadly mistaken just as the treatment by the government of those days of political prisoners in and nourished feelings of hatred towards england and made irishmen stand up for their country to support the claims of her right to freedom by every possible means which the times permitted he will find that the result of his action in ireland will be the means of strengthening the determination of irishmen not to yield to his attempts to tread down the nationalist spirit of the people and that greater enthusiasm and greater determination will be infused into our movement it has always been so persecution always causes redoubled exertion on behalf of the persecuted and if the right hon gentleman thinks that he is gaining by the intimidating effect of these harsh and cruel measures against his political opponents in ireland he will find the teachings of history do not justify the belief what could be more disgusting than the treatment meted out to mr fitzgibbon the matter has been brought to the notice of the right hon gentleman if any crime was political mr fitzgibbon was he refused to sell an ostrich feather to some emergency woman who went about among emergency men and soldiers he refused to supply her and he was taken up on a charge of boycotting and was convicted by two of the right hon gentleman removables and was sentenced if not upon this charge upon some other to imprisonment with hard labour he was one of the principal if not the principal merchants of castlerea a man of considerable substance of good credit and a large trader and shopkeeper he was imprisoned in one of these irish gaols and the depth of the barbarism to which the instruments of the right hon gentleman descended will be well illustrated when i tell you that the work which the governor selected as the most suitable for this political prisoner was to set him to clean out the latrines of the prison it used to be the custom before the christian era for savage nations to set their prisoners of war to this work and the right hon gentleman in permitting similar treatment to political prisoners for the matter has been brought to his notice and he is responsible for it and has defended it and similar action from his place in the house is descending to the level of barbarous nations of old times who when they could not overcome their enemies in the open field sought by degradations and by torture of this kind to make up for the deficiencies of their forces it is horrible that respectable men in ireland should have to submit to such barbarities mr fitzgibbon refused to do this work he was right in refusing this work and he received as a punishment repeated terms of bread and water two or three others of his fellow prisoners the political prisoners convicted of the same offence of boycotting were selected for the same work the right hon gentleman did not put any of his pet belfast forgers to clean out his prison cesspools they were allowed even before the change in prison rules which the right hon gentleman effected to get himself out of a dilemma to wear their own clothes to walk about in their shooting jackets and other light summer costumes as if they were gentlemen at large in these gaols indeed they were not compelled to do any work at all so far as i am aware and certainly none of the dirty disgusting work which was given to the right hon gentleman political opponents it is for political prisoners that the right hon gentleman reserves treatment of this kind he reserves this treatment not so much for irish members of parliament for he has some little shame with regard to them he is somewhat afraid of the light of public opinion he does not commonly inflict upon them sentences of hard labour sometimes he does but not always in the case of someone particularly objectionable like the hon member for kerry mr e harrington commonly he does not put them to clean out privies but he makes it as unpleasant as he can in many other ways it is with humbler men men upon whose sufferings public opinion cannot be centred in the same way as it is upon those of members of parliament that he inflicts these barbarities if life is taken as in the case of poor john mandeville it does not matter he is only a poor farmer or tradesman a man of whom the english people will not take much notice who will be talked about for the time but the memory of whom will not last long perhaps not till the next general election but sir what does this bring us to it brings us to this conclusion that if your treatment is not fit for ordinary prisoners must it not be still more unfit for your political prisoners the right hon gentleman says he will make no distinction between political prisoners and others but he has made a distinction he has made a distinction according to the class of political prisoners that if they are drawn from a higher class and from a better grade than ordinary prisoners they are to have privileges accorded them which are not accorded to the ordinary grade of political prisoners like mr fitzgibbon mr fitzgibbon is to be put to clean prison sewers and cesspools but the irish member of parliament will be allowed to wear his own clothes and he will not be allowed to do any more objectionable work than oakum picking this is proceeding altogether upon wrong lines if one political prisoner who has committed an offence is to be treated in one way and in a different way from another who has committed the same political offence what becomes of your justice and of your consistency if one man has done the same thing as the other why should they not be treated in the same way and where is the justice in setting up these lines of distinction because one man comes into prison with better clothes on his back than another that is not the principle we have insisted upon we wish to look to the quality of the offence and if the offence is of such a character that it is committed for political motives and for the sake of furthering a political cause with which the offender is identified and not for selfish or unreasonable motives we say that the offender is one who claims to be treated as a political prisoner and that if there is any distinction to be made between a different class of prisoners that distinction should be based upon the difference in the political nature of the offences in the one case as compared with the gross nature of the offences in the other and that the law should take cognisance of that in the infliction of the sentences but the right hon gentleman proceeds upon different lines he selects his political supporters in belfast who have committed disgraceful forgeries and he says to them because you are conservatives and gentlemen i will permit you to wear your own clothes in prison and to have privileges as regards hair clipping and beard cutting which i will not permit to such men as mr fitzgibbon of castlerea and he says to irish members of parliament i will permit you whom i know and who sit opposite to me in the house of commons i will permit you certain exemptions and certain privileges these concessions having only been obtained after a severe struggle between the right hon gentleman and these members in which struggle several have risked their lives that is the principle upon which the right hon gentleman goes now we protest against that and we shall not cease to protest against it until we induce parliament to carry out our views we consider that a man who forges a name to a document a man who commits a robbery a man who steals his neighbour property whether he be a peasant or whether he be a lord should be treated as a man who commits a disgraceful offence and that the man on the other hand who has offended against the susceptibilities of the right hon gentleman or his agents in ireland who has advised the tenant farmers to combine for their own self protection and in doing so has transgressed the provisions of a law made specially for the purpose of reaching political offences and political offences only that such men should be treated if you like as men whom you may think it necessary to deter from a repetition of the same offence but not as men who have committed any disgraceful offence and whose minds stand in need of reformatory discipline that is a plain position and one which can be maintained it is one which has received the sanction of the executive authorities of all countries at all times that political offences have been committed it is one which received the sanction of the conservative legislature of this country years ago it is one which we shall continue to force upon the attention of the right hon gentleman and this house until we obtain its recognition if not from this house certainly from the next parliament which the people of this country will have an opportunity of returning\n",

      "it has been a great pleasure to me to come to nottingham and i need hardly assure you that the reception with which you have honoured me will rank among those which i shall chiefly cherish in my recollection during my life cheers believe me such greetings as yours to me such expressions of sympathy with ireland as have gone forth from this great meeting will do more to keep the irish people within the paths of the constitution cheers and the rash ones amongst them from the perpetration of crime than all the years of coercion cheers and groans that lord salisbury promised laughter and cheers why we have had three years of his coercion and we had six centuries of it before he came administered by much better and stronger men than lord salisbury cheers and how has lord salisbury succeeded he has given us too little coercion and he has given us too much coercion for success laughter he ought to have given us more or none at all laughter this mixture of governing ireland under the constitution and by coercion will never succeed hear hear i have never argued that it is impossible to govern any other country by pure coercion but i have always maintained that you cannot simultaneously rule by coercion and under a parliamentary system hear hear if you established a pure despotism and took away the representation and went in for or years of administering even and equal justice to all classes alike then perhaps you might succeed if on the one hand the irish landlords were controlled with a firm hand outside the law and the constitution while on the other hand the moonlighters of kerry were equally controlled that would be equal justice perhaps that might succeed but you cannot succeed by the kind of mixture that is going on in ireland at present under mr balfour groans now the present chief secretary is reckoned by some of his supporters to be a very clever and a very able man i am disposed to think as one who has not taken part in the struggle in ireland since mr balfour went there i am disposed to think as a looker on that he has made about as many and as large mistakes as it was possible for anybody to make in the time he made his first mistake he and his government between them when he refused in the autumn of to make provision for the distressed condition of irish tenants hear hear and when he rejected the bill for the relief of irish tenants which i had the honour to bring before the house of commons in the autumn of he made his second mistake in the following session when after having been forced by the plan of campaign cheers to bring forward a bill modelled on the lines of mine the rejected of the session before he left out all provision for the arrears and for the restoration of evicted tenants that omission that has existed in ireland from that day to this hear hear the tenants who were given a reduction of their future rents with one hand under the provisions of that measure were left to stagger along under the vast load of unreduced arrears the tenants who had been evicted from their holdings owing to the impossibility of paying their rents before the act of was passed were left without the protection of that act hear hear and one of the causes of the great new organization which has sprung into existence in ireland within the past few weeks and which will sweep mr balfour and his props away like the chaff before the whirlwind was the omission of these two provisions in the act of i was most anxious personally that the land question in ireland should not be exacerbated i was most anxious that the tenants should not be combined into a resisting force hear hear i know the dangers of such a movement but i have every hope that those dangers will not accompany the present movement i was anxious to rely on the legislature and the professions of the tory party at the hustings in that they intended to legislate justly for ireland from westminster i appealed to the government in the house of commons in to admit those evicted tenants within the provisions of the act of and to make some reasonable provision for the reduction of arrears as was done in scotland in the case of the scotch crofters hear hear i encouraged them to do this by holding out to them the prospect that they would be richly rewarded but they were fools enough after feeling disposed for a while to listen to what i had said to listen to a deputation of irish landlords who came over to lord salisbury to tell him not to listen to us they were fools enough to do that and they have reaped their reward in the failure and destruction of their government the irish tenants many of them have admitted what have been the benefits of the act of but have declined to abandon the men who had helped to win that act for them justly so as in this country one set of men will stand up for another set of working men without having any grievance of their own so in ireland tenants will stand up for their weaker brethren and insist that if injustice is done to one it is injustice done to all cheers and so for want of one half pennyworth of tar lord salisbury has lost his ship laughter and cheers my reluctance to promote the formation of another great agrarian agitation or movement was of necessity overcome i could not see the men upon these estates throughout ireland left to be ground between the landlords the emergency men and the government cheers it was pure vengeance and nothing else that prevented these men from having the same rights as the rest of the tenantry of the country it was pure vindictiveness the government recognized that they had been compelled to do in what they had refused to do in and they turned upon these tenantry upon the ponsonby estate and upon the other estates throughout ireland who had been evicted before the passing of the act of and said we shall exterminate you but their fellow tenants in ireland have said be of good heart my brethren we will not allow you to be hurt we shall form ourselves into an organization which will stand foot to foot with the landlord conspiracy cheers we shall put down our money we shall put down for every that is put down by the government and landlord conspiracy we shall meet that conspiracy with its own weapons and we shall beat it cheers the result has been that this new movement although only just commenced bids fair to be the greatest and most powerful and most peaceful movement that has ever existed in ireland or in any other country hear hear all this is simply due to the wonderful ability of mr balfour and his government laughter he had everything in his favour except his own folly and stupidity laughter the depression in prices which existed two or three years prior to the commencement of has passed away owing to revival of your trade in this country the prices of irish agricultural produce have risen considerably the loss of the irish tenantry has become a more tolerable one nothing was necessary so far as the agrarian question was concerned more than to leave them alone to avoid irritating them to avoid driving these poor wretches who had been cast out from the benefit of the act of into a corner but to give them the same privileges the same rights as the tenantry throughout ireland cheers with all their firmness and strength and cleverness they could not do this simple thing the result is as i have told you there is now a movement in ireland which mr balfour will not be able to defeat and which will defeat him cheers and there is a situation of affairs in that country entirely brought about by his own folly which utterly prevents him or his government from boasting that they have governed ireland well or succeeded in pacifying that country cheers ireland it is true is tranquil and free from crime but she is not appeased she does not submit to the government hear hear she is not governed by her own consent on the contrary the disposition of the people against the government their aversion for the government methods and measures has been intensified tenfold during the last three years of coercion if ireland is tranquil and free from crime the credit is not due to the firm government and coercion of mr balfour the credit is due to your great leader mr gladstone cheers and to the liberal party cheers who by their sacrifice in leaving office in and in allowing their ranks to be more than decimated by the general election of that year gave up the prospect of position of political office in and in allowing their ranks to be more than decimated by the general election of that year gave up the prospect of position of political influence and of place and power of government for many years cheers these have shown the irish people that they can sacrifice a great deal for their sakes have given them confidence in the ways of the constitution and have persuaded them that the time is coming in the near future hear hear when mr gladstone returned to power will give them that legitimate freedom that power of dealing with their own affairs which can be granted to them without injury to your greater and more important interests hear hear this is something for you to be proud of to any one who has studied the sad history of ireland and who knows that only ten short years ago the great masses of the people of ireland trusted very little to any constitutional action it is a great consolation to reflect that he and you will hereafter be able to say we helped to win ireland to the constitution we had our share in inducing her to confine her attempts for her own amelioration solely to peaceable means we took a part in this great work cheers i do believe a part in this great work cheers i do believe that no greater reward can be reaped by any party or by any people than the knowledge which will assuredly be yours in the near future that you have helped in restoring peace and prosperity in ireland and making her truly a sister and a self respecting nation cheers it is a proud thing also to us to be able to work with you and the liberal party with self respect with the knowledge that while helping you we also help our own country we gladly work with you we gladly join our english brothers in the consideration of those great questions concerning the welfare of your working classes which are now pushing themselves to the front i say we gladly join in this we do so humbly we know that in our position as the representatives of the irish nation where unfortunately there is no manufacturing industry and where unhappily the fruit of the labourer toil is too seldom his own we are not entitled to put our views forward with that confidence which rightly belongs to those who live in this country and have studied these great questions but we are glad to be able to assist you humbly and to be the best of our ability cheers and we fervently trust each and all of us that the relations between employers and employed will be settled in this country without injury to either side and that moderation and a desire of compromise will be observed by both parties to the dispute hear hear we admire your great employers of labour your capitalists who have helped so well by their ability and knowledge to build up the great industries of this country hear hear we admire still more the trained masses of your workpeople who by their skill and industry in all the manufacturing arts have made england the wonder the admiration and envy of the world cheers we trust that these two interests may never come into collision and as you have to day at your head and long may he be spared to you the greatest statesman of his age loud cheers may providence spare him long enough to give his mind and ability to the consideration of these great questions and to the solution of them so far as they can be solved by legislative action in a way which will be productive of peace satisfaction and honourable contentment between the great classes in this country who are so intimately concerned in their peaceable solution cheers now you will pardon me for having said a few words upon such a topic a topic which of course i am not entitled to discuss with any authority a topic which necessarily i must know little of but i will say this that we should like humbly to follow in your footsteps and should like when you have given us power over our own business at home we should like instead of plotting against the integrity of this great empire instead of seeking of levy war against the queen laughter instead of striving for the separation of the two countries we should like to do some little thing and there is more to be done than perhaps many people in this country think to give employment to our people at home hear hear to develop the struggling industries of our country to teach our agricultural classes how to farm their land hear to teach our people how to work and to take advantage of those industrial and mineral resources which ireland to some extent possesses hear to look after the arterial drainage of the country to improve our harbours to develop our lines of inland navigation to promote the prosperity of languishing fisheries to do all those things mostly by those means which only a native legislature can do which is intimately acquainted with the wants of the people of the country cheers we want to do these things not with your money as mr balfour is doing at the present moment in the west of ireland but with our own money and our own resources cheers we think that irishmen who live in ireland is very little fitted for such work hear hear in the first place he has no knowledge of these things cheers and laughter in the second place as he admitted very candidly the other day he does not want to have any knowledge of it he is guided in his engineering operations and he is a skilful engineer by the advice of the irish board of works a government department which has strewn the coast of ireland with monuments of its engineering incapacity laughter we believe that the sums of your money so spent will be largely wasted and that they will not fructify and come back to you hear hear at any rate we believe that they will disappoint the expectations of those who spend them and we condemn as intolerable as a monstrous job of the worst description this policy of spending large sums of money in ireland that the tory party may say that they have an irish programme cheers i think i shall show you that we have something to do except treason cheers when this great reform of mr gladstone has been carried out in addition to the crime of separation you are told on the other hand that the loyal minority will take up the cause of separation well if they take up arms against the irish people they will also take up arms against the british government and according to colonel saunderson they are going to beat both laughter now this talk of the loyal minority and its rebellious and warlike instincts is the greatest nonsense cheers the protestants of ireland are no more an unreasonable and hot headed and foolish set of people than any other people there are a few orangemen about belfast who annually undertake demonstrations in honour of william of orange when they endeavour if the police allow them to break a number of catholic heads and wreck a certain number of catholic houses and shops but that is the extent of the warlike capability of the loyal minority laugher the protestants do not all live in belfast there are only some of them there and only some of the belfast men are foolish orangemen the great majority of the protestants of ireland are just as sensible as you are cheers they are not going to be led to break their heads against a stone wall merely because an irish legislature showers benefits upon them which it certainly would do hear hear the protestant farmers of ireland do not have this fear of home rule that is attributed to them for political purposes in this country i think it is probable that they are not so much in favour of home rule as the great bulk of the irish people are but my own idea of that is that the matter does not trouble them very much one way or the other and that like easy sensible men they will see that their interests lie with the rest of the country and that they certainly will not call out before they are hurt cheers if irishmen were so far forgetful of what has been done for them of the sacrifices that you have made for them of the trust and confidence that you have placed in them as to allow themselves for a single instant to do anything in the spirit of the darker times of the middle ages and to injure any man on account of his religion or his politics hear hear then it would be right and proper and then it could be said by the protestants of ireland that home rule had failed and that the irish people were incapable of self government but that has not been their reputation the catholics of ireland and i speak as a protestant cheers have not been and are not intolerant or bigoted hear hear i regret to say there has been too much of it upon the other side and they having suffered for these things in the past are not the men to destroy their own future by doing that which would bring upon them the merited contempt and indignation of the english people hear hear this experiment of home rule will be watched with jealous eyes every mistake and mistakes must be made by all governments and all legislatures every mistake will be magnified and reported to you over here depend upon it that the people who will be so carefully watched who will have many incentives to good behaviour will be very careful how they make mistakes and they will have many incentives to good behaviour will be very careful how they make mistakes and they will not make any if they can help it hear hear the argument is an argument if it is anything of intimidation undisguised intimidation hear hear oh says these men we are arming these orangemen in the north of ireland and if the imperial parliament of the queen dare to give legislative rights to ireland we will oppose the forces of the crown by armed insurrection would be as great a storm in a teacup as was ever heard of they would be surrounded and their arms taken away from them the first moment they took the field and they would be sent back sadder and wiser men to look after their own business belfast hear hear but if there was any foundation for this intimidatory talk the people of england will not be intimidated cheers if they are once convinced and i believe that the time is very nearly come when the majority are convinced shouts of they are now yes but i am speaking now of the people of england by themselves i know that the majority of the people of great britain are in favour of mr gladstone and of home rule but i say that the time is coming when the people even of england will be in favour of home rule and once they are convinced that it is just and right and that in no other way can ireland be justly governed it is not the tin trumpets and the drums of the orangemen of belfast that will frighten them out of it cheers and laughter there is another argument used they say that we are lowering our flag in accepting mr gladstone proposals this argument is used by the tory party they say we the tory party are going to uphold the honour of ireland and we are not going to allow them to accept this contemptible measure laughter they ask us to remember our history while in the same breath they say we have no history they remind us of the glories of grattan parliament and they ask are irishmen going to give up their national birthright of grattan parliament for this contemptible mess of pottage laughter we are very much obliged to these good gentlemen for taking in saying that there was danger of friction and mischief contained in the measure of hear hear grattan parliament and constitution gave us power of separate action in imperial matters a most dangerous power and a power which was abused in those days for instance supplies for the army and navy were voted separately by the irish parliament and there was an irish mutiny act which was also passed distinct from the british mutiny act hear hear and the irish parliament could refuse to vote the forces of ireland for the purpose either of defence or of foreign wars if you have this separate action under the constitution it is most dangerous to the integrity of the empire and sure to lead to friction they refused to recognize the regent when he was appointed well it did lead to friction that was one of the reasons why the constitution of was taken away and why the union was brought about but on the other hand the constitution was deficient in most important provisions regarding our own business which are present in the proposals now before us under the constitution of the ministers were appointed by the crown they held office at the pleasure of the crown and not at the pleasure of the majority of parliament that is to say the constitutional theory was carried out in its integrity and strictness instead of leaving it as in england so we have this power of separate meddlement sic in imperial matters of a dangerous character to the empire and not with the general agriculture of ireland or the development of the industries of that country i confess that i prefer for the sake of ireland and for the advantage of ireland the modification and alteration suggested in to the hard and fast system of i think that the teachings of experience have been adopted in the framing of the act of that the dangers and pitfalls of the constitution of have been avoided that all that is necessary for our benefit and our advantage and power over our own domestic organization and imperial affairs has been taken out of that constitution and everything that is mischievous or dangerous to your interests to the integrity of the empire has been avoided and rejected cheers that is my answer to those who say that we are lowering the flag of our country because met you and waived our strict rights waive them where these rights were not necessary for the advantages to our country that we aim at advantages which i have described to you we believe if this system is adopted it will result in the permanent union of the two countries and the cessation of the strife of centuries and the strengthening of this great empire and in the prosperity and happiness of our own people cheers the imperial parliament after the union might have legislated for ireland justly they might have conciliated ireland they might have taught her to believe that from westminster justice could come to our country that equal laws could be made there but did they no they lost their opportunity just as mr balfour lost it in just as every government has lost it from up to the present day hear hear they were always too late the loyal minority in ireland prevented them from legislating justly for ireland in time how many years did it take after the union before catholic emancipation was granted before a catholic could sit in parliament it took years but it was then not yielded because it was right it was only yielded because an english minister told the king that the peace of ireland could not be maintained unless it were granted then agriculture was our sole industry surely you would think than any legislature except a legislature of children would not have left the tenants of ireland for years more at the mercy of their landlords more at the mercy than negro slaves of the southern states of america more at their mercy and in a far worse condition than the negro slaves were the slaves were well fed and comparatively well housed hear hear and cries of shame the attempts of irish land reformers in were brushed on one side and rejected hear hear they asked for very little in those days only some slight recognition of the tenant right to sell his interest when he wished to give up his holding but that was too much for the imperial legislature for the parliament at westminster and it was refused in mr gladstone with great difficulty carried a land act hear hear he could not do anything better at that time had it not been for class prejudices in the situation in ireland might have been retrieved but things were allowed to go on from bad to worse the irish landlords were allowed to coerce their tenants out of the provisions of the act of then came the great agrarian crisis of we all know the history of the compensation for the disturbance of tenants bill and how that small that little bill which if it had been passed would have prevented all the terrible problems of and or certainly would have prevented much of them how that little bill was thrown out upon the first reading by the house of lords shame mr forster ought to have told the house of lords to govern ireland themselves no he ought not to have held office for a single instant after the rejection of that bill but he was a man of great hope he believed in the old whig doctrine that justice could be done to ireland from westminster and he wished to try again i recollect his coming up to a group of us irish members in palace yard after the rejection of that bill and saying to us pointing with his thumb over in the direction of the house of lords if they do that again i shall leave them to govern ireland by themselves but i knew too well that the rejection of that bill would put the situation in ireland beyond either mr forster control or the control of any other man and that it would be too late next year to talk about compensation for disturbance and so it was hear hear agrarian revolution in ireland gathered strength and weight the people had consolidated themselves into a great organization and parliament then commenced to understand something about the irish land question and instead of a small compensation for disturbance bill we had a great and extensive measure of land reform we know how that was delayed in its coming into action we know how although that act was passed in there are to this day many thousands of irish tenants who have never been able owing to the block in the courts and the imperfections of machinery to come under its beneficial provisions coercion has always been swift to strike but remedial legislation from westminster has always been halting slow disappointing in its effects and too late when it does come hear hear we pointed out the imperfections of the act it is not necessary for me to trouble you with what they are or were the absence of provisions for arrears the non inclusion of leaseholders the failure to make the judicial rent date from the date of application might be referred to under the act of a tenant might have had to go on paying an almost impossible rent to the present but for the act of which altered the matter then there was the failure to protect the tenants improvements we pointed out these things until we were tired but it was felt that the act could not be got through the house of lords if anything more was added to it although the justice of our contention was admitted mr gladstone government and the powerful liberal party at his back had to receive the bill back from the house of lords in a maimed incomplete and ineffectual condition mr balfour was boasting the other day that in his act of he had brought in the leaseholders and had made the judicial rent date from the application of the measure but he forgot to tell them that the very words of these provisions were taken from the very bill which i myself framed in kilmainham in cheers and we had to wait all that time from the end of to the end of before we could get these modifications and improvements important as they were and affecting such large classes in ireland now i think i have shown you sufficiently well that it is hopeless to look to westminster and to a single parliament in westminster for attention to our affairs i think i have made out a case that we are justified in urging that inasmuch as years experience has shown that the parliament at westminster is unable or unwilling to pay attention to the wants of ireland it is time to give us the power to pay attention to them for ourselves cheers we believe we are confident that we shall get this power cheers as i said at the commencement this confidence sustains us we recognize for the first time that we are within the constitution that within the constitution we are sure of victory cheers our people could never really believe this before i used to preach it to them when i was commencing the foundation and the formation of my parliamentary movements in i used to preach it to them and yet i could not help admitting to myself all the time well these people really have no reason to believe in the faith which i have but which it is difficult impossible for me to ask them to have but they believe with me now cheers they believe that all things will come to them peaceably and will come soon cheers and in that confidence they are willing to suffer what they must suffer for a brief season they are willing to suffer it without complaint and without harbouring feelings of vengeance against their persecutors and their tormentors for the system of government in ireland is a system of torture shame i have every confidence that they will continue in that frame of mind that they will reward the magnificent exertions which you in your meeting to night make exertions which are repeated and re echoed back from every quarter and part of england hear hear by remaining in this frame of mind by continuing their peaceful agitation by refusing to allow their movement their present great movement to be stained by crime hear hear you will be richly rewarded in a tranquillized ireland a peaceful ireland and a prosperous ireland one which will no longer be a discredit and disgrace to you but a sister nation which will assist you to the utmost of her ability and her strength in maintaining your great interests wherever the flag of england floats cheers and just as you have relied in the past upon the valour of irish soldiers on many a hard fought field so these poor men will know when they die in your service in the future that their homes are safe and their wives and their little ones are safe from the ruthless hands of the exterminator that they will be no longer rewarded by the destruction of their roof trees that their country is safe their children safe and prosperity to ireland assured cheers that is the confidence i have in that i believe it is a confidence which is assured by each one and every one of us hear hear you were taken unawares at the last general election you had not time to grasp the situation it is true that you did not believe every lie that was told you but still the repetition of a lie is bound to have some effect but in the interval those things have been dissipated everything has been changed and you know what the irish question is now hear hear you do not require to be taught by me or any other men you are sufficiently instructed upon every merit of that question and you have made up your minds cheers and all we want now is an opportunity hear hear we are not in a hurry for an opportunity if they like to go on for two or three years longer it will be so much the worse for themselves but we shall be glad to have it to morrow and whenever it comes we are ready cheers we have got our men and we have got our money hear hear i now desire to say that i shall carry a message from you to my countrymen of hope and good cheer cheers this great meeting of yours will encourage them it will consolidate them in the belief that justice will be done to them cheers all we want is that our people should remain steady and that you should remain steady and we feel convinced that the great liberal party who have never yet lost a battle loud cheers will win and win triumphantly headed by our glorious leader in this coming great contest loud cheers i do not know how to thank you or to tell you how much i thank you for the reception you have given me to night as regards the proceedings before the special commission shame i knew those letters were forged when nobody else could know it hear hear and pigott did and laughter but i would rather have died with this knowledge left to myself and have passed away under the suspicion and certainty that i had written these letters cowardly mean and contemptible as they were rather than have accepted the vindication offered to me by the government cheers i did not accept their method of vindication and i would rather have gone without clearing my character by such agencies and such means why did i not accept it because i knew that which is now patent to everybody that the vindication was a sham and a trap that under the pretext of investigating the charges against myself and other individuals they thought to try our country and the whole case of the times italics during the progress of these investigations has been changed from the personal charges and allegations against myself and my colleagues into accusations against our movement and against our country hear hear we declined then to accept the reference the government were attacking us they said they were neutrals and disinterested spectators only anxious to ascertain the truth laughter englishmen when they fight are in the habit of fighting openly themselves they do not go behind some other person and put him forward to fight for them but the government fought us from behind the times italics shame they fought us through these forgeries and through these infamous instruments who were produced to destroy us they lent to the times italics all the government machinery that the times italics asked them for renewed cries of shame they allowed the agents of the times italics to ransack the post office and open our letters they gave them the use of their attorney general on the one hand of their detective service and forces upon the other they gave them the loan of the whole irish administration these neutral people laughter i shall be very much surprised if it does not turn out that they promised them money as well whether the bill will be honoured when it comes due is another question laughter time will tell that the attorney general stated the other day that he supposed it would be a great many years before the history of the government connexion with the times italics came to be written at the beginning of this business we were told that the government had no connexion with the times italics laughter and cheers but he said when this history does come to be written after a great many years it will be seen that the government have nothing to be ashamed of laughter well if the government have nothing to be ashamed of in the matter a voice bad luck to them and laughter they will gratify our curiosity by letting us know in prehistoric times what the truth is with regard to this connexion between the government and the times italics i want to know and i think the country wants to know i want to know how far the government have been un english enough and mean enough to attack us from ambush and by the agency of these disreputable instruments we want to know how far this persecution and plot have been a government persecution and i think we are entitled to know cheers three judges have been taken away from the business of the country for the purpose of investigating these charges and allegations which it is now admitted were from top to bottom not only forged letters but all through the concoction of the late richard pigott cheers the so called parnellism and crime which constituted the charges and allegations which this commission was appointed to make inquiry into was sworn by houston to be nothing more than an enlarged edition of parnellism unmasked and parnellism unmasked was written by richard pigott cheers therefore parnellism and crime was written upon the foundations laid by richard pigott laughter so we have here the time of these three judges taken up the time of parliament taken up the time of the judicial tribunals of the country taken up to investigate charges which one and all are now admitted to have been charges brough forward first of all and in their origin by the infamous richard pigott if parliament and the country had known these things i do not believe that even this powerful government could have obtained the passage of this special commission act however it has been the case of the engineer hoist with his own petard for no even which we could have compassed could have done the government and their party so much injury in the country and have thrown so much lasting discredit upon the name of tory and of conservative as the history so far as it has yet been gone it of these transactions and when the whole story comes to be told and we shall see if we cannot persuade this parliament to tell us the whole story we shall get at the bottom of it as soon as the country has had the opportunity for which we are all waiting cheers the next special commission will be one appointed not to try false charges and accusations and forged letters but the reality of the connexion between the present first lord of the treasury and his old friend walter laughter and cheers mr parnell concluded by moving a vote of thanks to the chairman which was agreed to and the meeting closed\n",

      "mr chairman ladies and gentlemen i thank you mr chairman in particular for the speech and the expression of kindness of confidence and of praise with which you have introduced me to this assembly and i thank also the eighty club and our friends for the honour which they have done me in inviting me to their hospitality to night i deem this honour of no little worth and of no slight importance believe me ladies and gentlemen that such a body as this extending their hospitality to me has a great effect in ireland cheers it will remind the irish people that they are not alone in their struggle hear hear for the legitimate rights of their country hear hear and will remind them also which is of very much more importance that their responsibility is not a sole responsibility in this matter cheers when they hear that the eighty club have met me to night in such numbers and have committed themselves to their cause i mean the cause of ireland they will be more than ever impressed with the necessity that both in their speech and in their action they shall do nothing to damage the position and the power of their potentialities in this country cheers they will recognise that the position of the irish people and of their fight is no longer the position of a forlorn hope cheers but that it is the advance of a victorious army renewed cheers with allies stronger and overwhelmingly stronger than themselves who by their own strength more than our strength are about to establish and to win for us the success of our cause cheers now mr chairman i have been thinking almost in doubt and fear when i have surveyed the magnitude of this gathering that perhaps this might be an appropriate occasion for me to reply to an old friend of mine and to a speech a little speech that he has lately been making in the house of lords hear hear and laughter i mean lord carnarvon renewed laughter lord carnarvon and i have had one or two exchanges before now and in anything which i wish to say i do not desire to impute to him anything more than a want of recollection and a want of recollection not as regards anything that came under my own knowledge but rather as regards matters that came under the knowledge of other persons as far as i am concerned he has never contradicted from first to last any statement that i have made cheers he has sought refuge in evasions in the raising of other issues and in assertions with reference to the intention of this that and the other person which had no bearing whatever upon the case cheers however he has recently complained and i think somewhat unfairly complained of my action in disclosing another of his propositions to us at the commencement of the session in the debate upon the address he said in his explanation the other day i must observe that it is hardly consistent with the usual laws of parliamentary fairness to wait until a person against whom the attack is made is in such a position as to render it absolutely impossible for him to reply to it if these allegations which have been made with regard to me were founded on truth there was no earthly reason why they could not have been said during the whole course of last summer when i could reply to them either in this place or elsewhere but those who thought fit to make them waited until i had miles of sea between me and this country and then an old story was vamped up with very considerable additions and embellishments i have to say ladies and gentlemen that it is not the old story it is a perfectly new one it is a matter that i have never referred to before and so far as i know nobody else has referred to it until lord salisbury attacked us in the house of lords and said in reference to the liberal party that men who associated with us who associated with assassins and with murderers were not fit to be entrusted with the government of this country and lord salisbury having in that speech drawn the sword upon us i think that i was entitled in my own turn to show that lord salisbury and lord carnarvon and the conservative party had not always considered that they were doing that which was derogatory in the governors of they country when they invited us to interviews with them asked us to dinner and luncheon with them and consulted as to how ireland was to be governed hear hear lord salisbury in his speech a few days before my reference to the crossmaglen prisoners had gone so far as to say that the association of the conservative party with the irish members in was only an association in lobby which the tory party could not help and which in fact the tory party would have very much preferred to have been without and it was very different from the state of affairs existing between us and the liberal party in the present day that was the reason i referred to the case of the crossmaglen prisoners because the case of the crossmaglen prisoners was a case where a number of men had been convicted i think for conspiracy to murder under lord spencer administration and upon the coming into power of the conservative government on a motion moved by myself for an inquiry into this and other cases the conservative government agreed to an inquiry in that case and lord carnarvon had himself undertaken such an inquiry what is lord carnarvon account of the matter but before proceeding to that i may say that the excuse as to thirteen thousand miles of sea is not a valid excuse in these days lord carnarvon says i made my speech about the crossmaglen matter six weeks ago i believe on the 11th or the 13th of february i am not certain of the date and there was ample time for lord carnarvon to have contradicted my statements both by letter and by telegram if he had chosen to do so he must have read the summary of my speech in australia or wherever he was it must have gone to him by cable as a matter of news and it was his duty if i had conveyed a false impression to have contradicted it as i have said either by cable or by letter cheers but he waits until my friend mr edmund dwyer gray to whom he made the communication in question was dead before he comes forward to contradict what i believe to be the truthful account of the matter given to me by mr dwyer gray hear hear immediately after the occurrence and he says now that he was pressed by many persons to reprieve the prisoners or vary their sentences he was pressed in one particular case by a gentleman now dead meaning mr gray in his lord carnarvon's drawing room after dinner and he lord carnarvon told him that he had considered the case with care and that in his opinion there was one prisoner out of the whole gang against whom so far as he could see there was not sufficient evidence to warrant his detention and he said that he certainly should consider the evidence carefully in respect of that prisoner now the statement that mr gray had made of his interview with lord carnarvon sent for him to his house i believe the viceregal lodge in dublin and told him that he had investigated the cases of the barbavilla prisoners and the crossmaglen prisoners and had decided in the case of the barbavilla prisoners that the prisoners had been justly convicted but that in the case of the crossmaglen prisoners there was not sufficient evidence to warrant their conviction and he intended to liberate them forthwith my recollections is that this statement of mr dwyer gray is perfect and presise sic and i am glad to say that i am enabled to give you a corroboration of my recollection in what is almost a voice from the grave september 2nd my dear lord carnarvon you will remember the private conversation we had last year at which you informed me that after personally revising the crossmaglen and barbavilla cases you had come to the conclusion with regard to the prisoners now in jail that in the former case the prisoners should be set at liberty and that in the latter case the law should take its course you authorised me to communicate this privately to mr parnell and others who had interested themselves in the crossmaglen case and i did so at the time the crossmaglen prisoners are still in jail and i have not heard that anything has been done about their release their case is about again to be brought before parliament it is an awful thing that these men about whose guilt at least of the sufficiency of the evidence against whom you had such doubts are still in prison of course as i have said our conversation was private but i cannot clear my mind of a knowledge of the facts and i should feel almost as if i shared the responsibility if i did not make some effort on behalf of these men cheers the only thing which suggests itself to me is to ask you to tell the present lord lieutenant and chief secretary what you had intended to do it may be that this will influence them to take the same humane course i am sure you will not think i am taking a liberty in writing to you thus frankly i am actuated by no motive except a desire for mercy and justice for these poor defenceless and hapless men i am my dear lord carnarvon yours faithfully e dwyer gray lord carnarvon was advised of that letter in a letter of which i have a copy here cheers i do not intend to trouble you by reading the whole of the correspondence since it would not be proper at this hour of the night the whole correspondence is for the press if they like to have it cheers lord carnarvon replied to mr gray and took the same line as he did in the house of lords the other night he charges mr gray with having been guilty of a breach of private confidence and he says that the conversation took place because mr gray at his own initiative pressed him after dinner or luncheon and he further says which differs from his version the other night that he agreed to consider the case of two of the prisoners instead of one and mr gray replied to that letter in another letter distinctly reaffirming all these charges and giving substantial evidence reminding lord carnarvon that it was not an interview after dinner but it was an interview to which he was formally invited by lord carnarvon which took place in the daytime in lord carnarvon study lord carnarvon then admits that the interview took place because he thought mr gray wanted to talk to him and admitted also that he may have been mistaken and this a mistake in the case of a man like lord carnarvon who complains of a breach of confidence when he admits that immediately after the interview he had repeated the substance of the conversation to two other people laughter well as i have said this correspondence will go to the newspapers if the newspapers like to have it and the public will judge whether the statement of lord carnarvon is correct that in relating this conversation it was a breach of confidence on the part of mr gray and that we have behaved outrageously in mentioning the matter under the greater provocation when lord carnarvon was miles away hear hear you will understand that my share in the matter has simply been to repeat what mr gray told me while mr gray was still alive i did not mention mr gray name at the time but i offered to produce my authority if lord carnarvon contradicted it he waited three months before giving the contradiction until he knew that the gentleman who was my authority was dead hear hear i now pass to what is a matter of personal king between me and lord carnarvon i mean that interview in which he sought from me and which took place although he states that if ever again he has an interview with a member of the irish party he will have it in the presence of a witness because we don't regard private conversations as binding this interview i say took place under circumstances of great precaution in an empty house in dublin to which he had escaped with great difficulty from the protection of his special detectives laughter who were taking part in the duties of protecting him from evil disposed persons i suppose assassins my friends and associates renewed laughter lord carnarvon again declines to contradict any of my statements my statements ladies and gentlemen were clear and precise they were that lord carnarvon sought this interview with me that after a preliminary conversation he told me that he wished to speak to me about a constitution for ireland that has not been contradicted loud applause that i said to him that in my judgment no mere local government scheme mark you ladies and gentlemen that is the cream of the matter hear hear the tory party said at the last general election that their policy was not a parliament but local government hear hear i said that no mere local government scheme like that of mr chamberlain would be sufficient but that to settle the irish question it must be a parliament and be called a parliament lord carnarvon replied i quite agree with you he has never contradicted that either hear hear he then went on to talk about the powers of the irish parliament i said that in order to control and to aid the industries of ireland the manufacturing industries it was absolutely necessary that the parliament should have power to protect these industries lord carnarvon also said to this that he quite agreed with it he has not contradicted that either hear hear and finally he asked me if this concession were made would the national league be dissolved and i said certainly the national league would be dissolved it would dissolve itself because the programme for which it had been formed would have been completed loud cheers he does not contradict any of these statements but in justice to lord carnarvon i must mention one fact i have never mentioned before he asked me whether i should have any objection to allow the very extensive powers of the irish parliament which he thought such a body should have even including the protection of irish industries whether i should see any objection to allowing these powers to be given by degrees that is to say that a certain number of subjects should be laid down in the bill creating a statutory parliament that there subjects should remain that the power of the irish government over some of them should come into force immediately that power was given to that body and that others should be postponed for a few years until they had dealt with the first cases i told him then in that i didn't believe that any valid or strong objection would be made to such a safeguard as that by any important body of public opinion in ireland he does not deny any of these things but with great ingenuity he tells us that he did not pledge himself to give us a parliament well i never said he did all i have stated in what lord carnarvon opinion was as expressed to me i did not say that he promised to us that he would give us that on the contrary i knew that lord carnarvon power was of course limited and that his influence and his ability to influence his own party would very much depend upon the prospects of the forthcoming general election cheers and when the election returns showed that the conservative party had a clear majority i knew that lord carnarvon knew that his power to influence his party was gone and he sent me a message subsequent to the general elections just before his resignation to say that he had done his best with his friends but that his efforts were unavailing and that he therefore resigned his position as lord lieutenant hear hear in doing so let me say that i attribute to lord carnarvon that i believe he acted as an honourable man and that his conduct was in very great contradistinction to that of the rest of his colleagues lately cheers he says that lord salisbury did not agree to give us a parliament but i have said this that my belief was that a special significance was to be attached to that interview coming at the time it did and that the man with whom it was held was the lord lieutenant of ireland i believe that that interview was held with the knowledge of lord salisbury hear hear and lord salisbury now admits that he knew that that interview was going to be held he admits that he authorised his lord lieutenant to hold that interview with the man whom he now describes as the associate of assassins and murderers cheers mark you ladies and gentlemen everything that i had done or that it is alleged that i have done was done years before this interview with lord carnarvon and was then just as perfectly well known to lord salisbury as they are at the present day hear hear well then lord carnarvon says again that he communicated the contents of this important confidential and private interview which he blazes me for having violated the secrecy of immediately after this interview to lord salisbury in other words lord carnarvon was in the habit of holding private interviews and binding those with whom he held those interviews to secrecy and at once going and letting other persons know everything that passes laughter he says i should have been wanting in my duty if i failed and i think he was quite right i don't blame him for having done so but i do blame him for charging me with a breach of secrecy and confidence in my action subsequently to the interview to that effect i should have been wanting in my duty if i had failed to inform my noble friend at the head of the government of my intention to hold that meeting with mr parnell and of what had passed between us at that interview at the earliest possible moment accordingly both in writing and by words i gave the noble marquis as careful and accurate a statement as possible of what had occurred within twenty four hours of that meeting now i think it would be most satisfactory to the general public it certainly would be most satisfactory to me if lord carnarvon would at once publish the statement in writing which he made to lord salisbury immediately after the meeting laughter and loud cheers provided that that statement includes what lord carnarvon said as well as what i said i am perfectly satisfied that the public will be convinced that lord carnarvon had made up his mind at that time that the only solution of the irish question was the conferring of an irish parliament and that lord salisbury was in the position of a man only too willing to be convinced hear hear i am afraid i have detained you an inordinate length no no over this question of lord carnarvon but it is a matter of considerable importance hear hear if the tory party and lord salisbury merely sent to ireland a man whom they knew to be a home ruler and in favour of an irish parliament they would not be absolved from having committed themselves to holding out some expectations considerable expectations and considerable inducements to the irish people to believe that they would grant them an irish parliament hear hear lord carnarvon not only talked to me about his views on this matter but he talked to my late friend mr gray and to several other people in dublin and it was perfectly notorious that lord carnarvon was the home rule lord lieutenant of the conservative party hear hear i will not go on to another matter a question that i promise you to deal with very briefly the question the rescript which has come from rome with reference to the plan of campaign hear hear i must admit to you in the commencement that i deal with this subject with the greatest unwillingness and i do not deal with it fully i do not think it is my business as an irish protestant to vindicate the freedom in political matters of irish catholics from my experience in such matters of other attempts from the same quarter to influence irish catholics in their political duty i am perfectly convinced that those gentlemen know perfectly well how to vindicate themselves hear hear and that they will allow no body of prelates no matter how numerous or how high or how influential to dictate to them or to influence them one jot or one iota in their duty in their political duty to their country cheers the thing has been tried from rome over and over again and ever since the irish people got their constitutional rights they have always defeated these attempts of the british by intriguing at rome to put fetters and manacles upon the hands of the irish leaders i have no fear at the present moment that this attempt on the part of this body at rome will have any other result than the disastrous failure and i believe the catholics feel it to be disastrous from a religious point of view the disastrous failure that has attended previous attempts in the same direction hear hear having said so much about this rescript i want to say one word about the language which is adopted here regarding this rescript it is assumed by the press of this country that because this religious body at rome has condemned the plan of campaign that therefore the plan of campaign is defeated and that not only the plan of campaign is defeated but also the national league and the irish parliamentary party have been defeated and that the whole national movement is past and done for no hopes could possibly be more fallacious hear hear in the first place neither the national league nor the irish national party have ever had anything to do with the plan of campaign even if it is going to be beaten by the combination between the spiritual powers at rome and the temporal powers in the shape of the british government in ireland that will not be the defeat of the national league i will tell you how it happened that the plan of campaign was originally started in october i was not at the time able to express any opinion on it i was dangerously ill an illness which i have not entirely recovered from even to this day and i was so ill that i was unable to put pen to paper or even to read a paper and i knew nothing about the plan of campaign until weeks after it had been started and even then i was so feeble that for several months until the opening of parliament i was unable to take part in public matters if i had been in a position to advise about the plan of campaign i candidly confess to you that i should have advised against it not because i suppose that it would be inefficacious to meet the grievances of the irish tenants i believe and always have thought that it would be most successful in protecting the irish tenants from evictions hear hear and in obtaining those reductions in their rent which the government of lord salisbury in the autumn of refused to concede to me when i moved the tenants relief bill cheers my judgment in that respect has been correct the plan of campaign undoubtedly has been most successful as regards the agrarian question in ireland it has saved thousands and thousands of tenants from evictions it has prevented enormous suffering in ireland loud cheers it has in fact pacified the country but i consider and still consider that there were features of the plan of campaign and the way in which it was necessary to be carried out which would have a bad effect upon the general political situation in other words upon the national situation i considered that it would form an excuse for tories in bringing forward a new coercion act and carrying that coercion out with a severity which has characterised executive action in ireland and that the iniquity of evictions in ireland would be lost sight of in this country owing to the repugnance which would be felt by the people of england and scotland and wales to some of the features of the plan of campaign hear hear therefore i should have advised the irish tenants to suffer a little while to bear their evictions in the firm confidence that although their troubles might last for a year or two yet in a short time they would be put an end to for ever by the concession of self government to their country rather than by embarking in a movement of that kind they should give any power to the enemy to cover over their own iniquity and to raise false issues on questions which had really no bearing on the matter at all i say this only in explanation of why the national league and the irish parliamentary party have never been identified with the plan of campaign when i was able to speak in the commencement of about the matter it was too late for my action the government had struck against my friends mr dillon and i think mr o'brien cheers it was too late for me to go in and tell these men that i thought they had made a mistake while the government was tackling them on the other side and i considered that as any mischief that could possibly have resulted from the plan of campaign had taken place when the coercion act was announced and was sure to be passed and it would be better for me to leave the tenant to reap the fruits of that successful agitation which had been set on foot but i stipulated three things i stipulated in the first place for four conditions in the first place that the national league should not be identified with the plan of campaign i asked in the second place that the sphere of the operation of this plan should be restricted as much as possible that it should be limited to those estates upon which it had already been put into operation so far as any solicitation on the part of the leaders of the movement went and that no fresh estates should be urged to enter it and thirdly i asked that the irish parliamentary party should not be identified with this plan fourthly i asked that there should be moderation in speech and action with reference to the carrying out of this plan and i think i did under the circumstances all that could reasonably have been expected of me cheers i think that these conditions have been fairly well held to by those concerned in the plan of campaign with the one single exception of lord massereene estate in the county of louth the other day i believe so far as i know that since then no single estate has been urged to enter the plan the fresh estates that have entered it have entered it spontaneously of their own accord and without solicitation on the part of my hon friends and i believe that in all probability in a short while the plan of campaign in the natural course would have been gradually succeeded by a method of agrarian organisation which i have for some time been engaged in maturing and which would have been i think free from those defects those political defects which were incidental to the plan of campaign and which would have absolutely corresponded in every respect with the system of organisation known as trade unionism in this country but we shall now have to wait just as the government struck a little too soon against mr dillon at the end of so they have induced the ecclesiastical authorities at rome to strike against him now too soon and i certainly think that it is not my business to interfere with any line which mr dillon and mr o'brien and the other catholics who have been engaged in this matter may think it right to take in vindication of their political freedom against the claim which has been put forward from this distant country in reference to the affairs of ireland cheers when the government strikes an irishman our rule is to fight for that irishman whether he is right or wrong laughter and cheers and when the government has in favour of its coercion laws called in the aid of rome i see no reason why we should alter from our policy renewed cheers now i wish to speak to you for a moment on this question of the right of combination i regard the right of combination the right of free speech the freedom of the press and of public meetings as necessary for the securing of our liberties in ireland cheers i do not know if these rights are not only denied as they are to us to day but if they should be successfully taken away from us what room there is for any constitutional movement and i consider that it is the duty of the irish people and of their leaders to suffer anything and to dare anything within the law for the maintenance of those rights cheers imprisonment loss of fortune and even death itself is not too great a price to give for the maintenance of this charter renewed cheers in days gone by you have shown that you knew how to suffer and how to die for these things and if the irish people are worthy of freedom they will suffer and endure all things in defence of their rights loud cheers well the government will say and do say that they are not interfering with these rights now let us take the question of combination or organisation rather combination from the agrarian point of view organisation in the shape of the national league from the national point of view let us see how the government have endeavoured to deal with persons combining in ireland and what is the difference between the law in england and in ireland in this matter now the act regulating the position of trade unions i am not speaking as a lawyer but as a layman i am informed that the act of provides that an agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation for the furtherance of a trade dispute between employers and workmen shall not be indictable as a conspiracy if such act committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime that is all i ask in respect to combinations of tenants in ireland that any act in contemplation for the furtherance of a trade dispute between tenants and landlords shall not be indictable as a conspiracy if such act committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime cheers but that is what the government distinctly refuse to allow us the question was raised by sir charles russell hear hear in the debate on the coercion act of last session and the government distinctly declined to allow the law to stand in respect to tenants combinations in the same position in which it stands in this country in respect of trade combinations is that equality is that fair play is that the unionist programme the very essence of which is equality and equal treatment loud cheers now this question of conspiracy runs through the whole matter take an example the other day they indicted mr condon the irish member for attending an illegal meeting and how did they prove that the meeting was illegal they did not prove it by mr condon own speech because his speech was so moderate and short that there was no offence disclosed in it they did not prove that this meeting was illegal by the production of the government proclamation of it because they had not proclaimed it but they proved that it was illegal and the magistrates held that it was illegal and sentenced mr condon to days imprisonment because mr healy on the same platform and at the same meeting but during mr condon absence had they alleged made a violent speech because mr healy makes a violent speech at a meeting when mr condon is not present therefore mr condon is to be sent to jail for days for that speech and under that doctrine of conspiracy mr healy is allowed without persecution to come over to london and to be present at this dinner laughter and cheers well now do think that the government even if the law allowed them which it does not do you think the government would venture at a trades union meeting in this country to prosecute one member of the trades union because at that meeting another person had made a violent speech hear hear well now in what respect is there similar freedom of the press i am only giving one example i could give you dozens in what respect is similar freedom of the press to that in england allowed in ireland let me give you an example if any newspaper publishes the report of a suppressed branch of the national league the editor of that newspaper is sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour and the plank bed well that is not the law in this country hear hear no newspaper editor in this country would be liable to imprisonment and a plank bed or any imprisonment at all because he published a report of a meeting however illegal that meeting might be let me give you two examples of this action against the press in in sic ireland there was a newspaper called the kerry sentinel italics which was in the habit of publishing reports of suppressed branches of the national league that newspaper was edited by mr edward harrington some five or six years before mr timothy harrington his brother became secretary of the national league he also had a part ownership in this newspaper when he became secretary of the national league he also had a part ownership in this newspaper when he became secretary of the national league in he gave up this partnership the government proceeded against mr edward harrington for the reports of those meetings they also proceeded against mr timothy harrington because he was a partner mr t harrington had not a shadow of connection with that paper to my knowledge he had not had for five years and yet the government of mr balfour unblushingly proceed against this man for a press offence which would not be a press offence in england simply because mr harrington was secretary of the national league and they could not find out that he had committed any illegality or the body to which he belonged they endeavoured to strike him down and to injure the national league by prosecuting him for a press offence committed by a newspaper ever sic which he had no control whatever i call that mean cheers i think the english language has lost its significance and the english people have lost their reputation if they think or will consent to think that actions such as those against mr corcoran the then foreman printer of the cork examiner italics actions such as those against poor little newspaper boys for selling the newspapers in the streets actions such as those against newspapers in country towns in ireland will be held to be brave by the english people or anything but mean and dastardly at the next general election cheers now in what way is freedom of organisation denied in ireland as regards the political question i have given you an example in comparison with trades unionism of the way in which agrarian organisation is denied to the irish tenant it is denied in the wholesale suppression of branches in those counties not by any means all of them or the majority of them have done illegal things or things which the government consider illegal now i say it is monstrous that our whole organisation should be suppressed almost in entire provinces simply an sic account of the reports or alleged reports of a few individuals attending meetings of two branches the question of the law of conspiracy is a most important question cheers in england of course you are protected to a great extent by your jury system which will not permit unreasonable action it was not so in past times in the history of your country when men were sentenced to be hung drawn and quartered for charges of conspiracy by judges like jeffreys and others in ireland the government send charges of conspiracy to be tried before their own creatures i say it is monstrous that one national league branch should be suppressed on account of the alleged report of another and that one speaker should be imprisoned on account of an alleged speech by another speaker cheers this then i believe to be our chance by insisting upon our rights to be willing to submit to any suffering which may be necessary to incur any persecution which may be necessary in carrying out such a programme as this i believe we shall retain the sympathy of the masses of the people of this country cheers ireland is not being treated as england is they are governed under different laws differently administered administered by men who would not be tolerated for one instant on the judgment seat of this country cheers we have before us a time i fear of great trouble in ireland the eviction notices served under the land act of last session nearly six thousand in number have now matured we wait to see what the action of landlords will be i believe that the government fear evictions as much as we do i believe that they regret that the house of lords destroyed last session that which was for the protection of a large class of judicial tenants in ireland and that they would gladly undo what the house of lords then did what is to be the fate of those six thousand heads of families now under sentences of death if the landlords proceed to evict the trial will undoubtedly be severe on the patience of our people at home and abroad i should advise my countrymen as i have to night advised them to withstand every provocation to submit to every persecution to suffer all things rather than to go outside the law as it exists in this country i trust they will remember that a great and historic party are committed to their cause and that they are not standing alone that they have for allies men who have never ultimately been beaten and that the party the great liberal party of england never in history have taken up any cause or attempted any reform without winning that cause and that reform in the end loud and prolonged cheers during which the hon gentleman sat down having spoken upwards of an hour mr parnell in responding was received with renewed cheering he said i am very much obliged to you not only for the vote of thanks which you have conferred upon me so unanimously but also for the patience with which you have listened to my long and i fear very tedious oration no no i can truly say that it has afforded me the greatest possible pleasure and instruction but encouragement to be here to night hear hear to see around me as i see many of the representatives of the future political thought and energy as well as of the present political thought of the country in union with the fair and moderate proposals placed before his country by mr gladstone cheers that is a very great encouragement to all of us irishmen to continue steadfastly in the constitutional path of supporting mr gladstone and the english nation in this great work of his of yielding to the just claims of ireland so far as may be necessary to confer upon her liberty peace prosperity and tranquillity loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell cork i am glad sir that the right hon gentleman the first lord of the treasury has seen it expedient to change from the absurd and untenable position which he took up on the last day when this matter was before the house when he told me that it was a question for me to decide it was for me and others to decide whether we should accept or reject this bill he now takes a more becoming ground for a minister of the crown when he says that it now rests with the house to decide i am glad he has amended his hand in accordance with the advice i took the liberty of giving him on the last occasion it is well that i should direct the attention of the house very shortly to the history of this question i originally asked for a select committee to inquire into the statements made affecting members of this house and into the genuineness and authenticity of the evidence on which the statements were made the right hon gentleman the first lord of the treasury in reply to a question of mine on the 1st july couched in these terms said that he declined to give me a select committee to inquire into the genuineness and authenticity of these letters firstly on the ground that he considered the issue was too limited and narrow and secondly on the ground that the tribunal i asked for was unfitted for the purpose but he went on to say we are willing to propose that parliament should pass a bill appointing a commission to inquire into the allegations and charges made against members of parliament in the recent action of o'donnell v walter the house will observe that the statement of the right hon gentleman on the 12th of july was that the inquiry was to be confined to the allegations made against members of parliament in the notice of motion which the right hon gentleman placed on the paper two days afterwards having in the meantime received a friendly hint at the cabinet council from the counsel for the taxes let that statement be denied or not and having had perhaps also the advantage of an interview then or subsequently with mr walter himself he mends his hand and extends the inquiry by the addition of and other persons an hon member why not what has that got to do with you mr speaker order order mr parnell he now proposes to inquire into the allegations and statements made against members of parliament and others in the course of the trial of the recent action of o'donnell v the times now sir i will show that this bill proposes to inquire not into my conduct not into the conduct of my parliamentary friends but it proposes to inquire into the conduct of the whole agitation of the land league in america in ireland and in great britain if you want an inquiry into the land league say so bring in a bill for the purpose and then we shall know what to say to it it is very odd that although the land league sprang into existence years ago it never occurred to the government to move for a commission to inquire into its proceedings until these forgeries these infamous forgeries appeared in the times the right hon gentleman said the other day that he had brought this matter forward in order to give us an opportunity of clearing our character and he repeats that statement to day i say that he has not brought it forward in response to my request or for any purpose of the kind he has brought it forward for the purpose of casting discredit on a great irish movement to endeavour to traduce a people whom you ought now to be fully ashamed and fully tired of traducing and to contrive a means of escape for his confederates from the breakdown of the charges which he and the hon and learned attorney general sitting beside him know full well will break down we are now told that these letters are only secondary matters and even if proved up to the hilt as it will be proved that each and every one of the letters mentioned the other night are barefaced forgeries it will not affect the case of the times you seek now to raise this turgid cloud in order to cover your retreat and the retreat of your confederates which you know well will soon be forced upon you i shall show by reference to the speech of the hon and learned attorney general that these charges and allegations are charges against the land league and not against me the hon and learned gentleman made no charges against me until he came to the forged letters he made four charges which he supported by false statements statements which i shall show to be false charges which the hon and learned attorney general will not venture to repeat when he knows what they are as he will know after i have done but these four charges and allegations would not have been charges and allegations but for the false statements put into the mouth of the right hon gentleman so that it comes to this that the whole case in the speech of the hon and learned attorney general for the defence in the recent proceedings breaks down against me personally it amounts to nothing it has not the weight of a grain of wheat not the weight of the chaff belonging to a grain of wheat apart from these forgeries yet we are told by the right hon gentleman that he is offering this inquiry into allegations made not against me leaving the forged letters out of the question for the purpose of enabling me to clear my character from the most cruel and infamous charges ever made against a public man and which have been made against me because i am a public man for i do not suppose that the london times ever would have given for these forgeries of this wretched ex member of parliament of whom we hear if they had not been letters implicating me or seeking to implicate me but my vindication from these cruel and abominable charges is to be postponed and left to the last there is first to be an inquiry into every conceivable thing an inquiry which we cannot see the limits of within less than two or three years and i am to be put to the expense of finding counsel to conduct this inquiry in ireland in america in france and wherever the judges may think it necessary to send a commission while if the inquiry went to the point as to these forgeries i know i could demonstrate to conviction within a week that they are forgeries and that is the fairness of the right hon gentleman this is how he shows himself so anxious to do justice to a member of this house he has told us indeed that he cannot compel us to go before a jury yes but if he had the courage of his grandmother he would send me before a jury now i say again that the charges and allegations of the hon and learned attorney general were made not against me and my colleagues but against the land league the hon and learned gentleman makes abundant reference to the land leage sic in this pamphlet from the times almost every page is studded with them he tells us at page of the pamphlet that most grave and serious charges have been made against the party known as the parnellite party i deny that the plaintiff is justified in saying that nine tenths of these charges refer to him they refer to the land league in ireland which was guilty of crime and iniquitous acts on page the hon and learned attorney general says why i will undertake to demonstrate that the alleged libels prior to june did not refer to the plaintiff or to the constitutional party with whom mr lucy represents mr o'donnell to have been connected but to the irish land league on page speaking of mr o'donnell the hon and learned attorney general says he knew that incidents would be put to him received in those journals which would have incriminated the land league also lower down on the same page he says what i say is that mr o'donnell has no right to assert that he ever was a member of the irish land league and that the organization of the land league under which outrages were incited and committed was one with which he was associated then on page we find more in the same strain the hon and learned gentleman says now the letter of mr o'donnell was a very sensible one but what are we to think of the gentleman who is now posing as an injured man as included in libels upon this very body the irish land league and lower down on page he says and his mr ruegg's client has pretended through his counsel that he is libelled in these attacks upon the league on page he says these murders can be traced to no cause whatever except the language used at land league meetings and so on i can run through the whole of the pamphlet and give you dozens of similar extracts to prove my contention still further if necessary but i do not think that it is necessary that i should do so it was the land league against which the indictment was brought by the hon and learned attorney general in the recent trial and it is against the land league that you are to issue this commission of inquiry and not against myself now if i refer to the speech of the hon and learned gentleman the greater part of which was absolutely void of foundation and a great deal of the rest of it without sense it is because the right hon gentleman the first lord of the treasury referred me to that speech as a substitute for the details which ought to have appeared in this bill in that speech there are abundant references to the doings and speeches of other people many of them most obscure but there is very little reference to my doings or speeches i think the hon and learned gentleman quotes one of my speeches in america and this is the head of one of the indictments against me to which the discovery of the forged letters is merely secondary i think there are four references to me altogether in the statement of the hon and learned gentleman outside of the forged letters he says that i went to america in this is one of my crimes for which i am to be tried by this commission and into the truth of which this commission is to be appointed to inquire he says that while i was in america in i had interviews with devoy ford and walsh the mere fact of my going to america in would have been too innocent even for the gullibility of a middlesex jury and it was too innocent for the hon and learned gentleman so he was obliged to bring in some of the falsehoods to which i shall refer he was obliged to say that i had interviews with ford and walsh walsh was the name specially mentioned because he was the organizer and prime mover in great britain of the conspiracy which carey in his evidence alleged was directed against mr forster life and which was known as that of the invincibles the hon and learned gentleman had seen i suppose that while in america i had had an interview with a father walsh who afterwards became treasurer of the land league in that country and who is now dead and it occurred to him at least to the intellect of the prompter of the right hon gentleman because i do not attribute any personal untruth to him because those untruths were put into his mouth and he was guilty not of want of truth but merely of want of veracity he had seen that i had known a father walsh in america but let it be known that walsh the land league organizer was not in america at the time i was there he was at his house at middlesbrough in this country where he continued to live until when he left after the time of the revelations of carey and went to america therefore he could not be that walsh that i met in america the only other walsh that i remember in america was father walsh but perhaps the hon and learned gentleman will explain who was the particular walsh whose acquaintance condemns me to the suspicion of having been engaged while in america in unlawful and criminal practices as regards mr patrick ford i have never seen him in my life but if i had seen him what then if i had seen him at that time it would not have made me guilty as a matter of fact while i was in america i was anxious to see him and i went to his office for the purpose of obtaining an interview with him but he was not at home and my time being limited i was not able to call again that describes the whole of my connection with mr patrick ford during my stay in america it has also been stated that i met john devoy while i was in america that is quite true with mr devoy i had several interviews he boarded the vessel in which i went to america on her arrival as a reporter of the new york herald he took me over the office of that paper and other places of interest in new york i admit to the fullest extent that i held communications with him with regard to political matters but all these things are open to the fullest scrutiny and they will be found on scrutiny to be absolutely innocent and colourless in every particular and destitute of any incitement to bloodshed so that halo of bloodshed and the lurid aspect which the hon and learned gentleman thought to make out of my visit to america and my meeting with men having the terrible reputations of devoy walsh and ford comes to this that the only one of these three that i saw was devoy and our intercourse was certainly of the most harmless and constitutional character this is one of the accusations apart from the forged letters to which the hon and learned gentleman has referred then the hon and learned gentleman in his second indictment said that i went to paris in february and while there i had interviews with mr egan it is perfectly true that i went to paris in february i went there to see mr egan and i not only had interviews with him but i stopped in the same hotel with him i not only went to paris once but i went there twice but then the hon and learned gentleman goes on to say that in this is to show how wicked i was when i went to paris about the same time sheridan was going about ireland disguised as a priest will the house credit that the hon and learned attorney general was so little informed of the facts of his case that for the purpose of attaching a guilty complexion to my visits to paris he was obliged to antedate sheridan journey to ireland disguised as a priest by fully eight months nobody but a person who was conscious that his statements could not be subjected to the test of evidence could have had the unblushing effrontery manifested by the hon and learned attorney general at the late trial then there is a third point which the hon and learned attorney general endeavoured to make against me in the same speech and that was a speech which i made on the 9th of september at ennis when i advocated boycotting undoubtedly i did make that speech advocating boycotting and then the hon and learned gentleman went on to say that i was present at a subsequent meeting in october at which mr matthew harris made a speech and that i did not rebuke him although i was present that makes the fourth charge urged against me in the speech of the hon and learned attorney general and these are the whole of the charges that the hon and learned gentleman made against me in that statement apart from the forged letters then with regard to my speech advocating boycotting it is true that i did so no doubt i am responsible for having advocated and perhaps introduced the practice of boycotting in ireland and the hon and learned attorney general claimed against me that from boycotting outrages and murders in some measure resulted that may be the hon and learned attorney general opinion but it is not mine i have never advocated the practice of boycotting since the passing of the arrears act of before that time i believe that it was necessary owing to the helpless and defenceless state of the irish tenantry a state to which your party and the house of lords contributed by the rejection of the compensation for disturbance bill i believed that i was justified under the circumstances in making that speech and advocating the practice of boycotting i admit that is a question that is open to discussion and that the hon and learned gentleman is entitled to his opinion and i to mine but i believe that this speech and other speeches of mine so far from promoting outrages prevented them i know well what my thoughts and my intentions were i know that my view and desire in all my speeches in ireland during the winter of and was to wean those few of the irish people who had sought refuge in criminal acts and outrages as a means of defence against their oppressors and to teach them to value parliamentary methods and the safety of entrance within the gates of the constitution just then opening and which now thank god are fully opened to them i believe i have been successful in achieving that object and that no man lives who can boast that he has brought a nation so soon to an implicit trust in constitutional and pacific measures as i can boast that i have brought the people of ireland now with regard to the speech of mr matthew harris here again is another example of the slipshod fashion in which the hon and learned gentleman got up his speech he stated that i was present during that speech why i was not present at all as a matter of fact i was several hundreds of yards away sitting in the hotel in galway and as another matter of fact that speech was not made at mayo at all the government shorthand writer who reported my speech and who reported mr harris speech at that meeting afterwards swore in court during the state trials in dublin that i was not present at that meeting but all these little facts are too small and too insignificant to be inquired into by the hon and learned attorney general in making statements which he knows are not going to be answered now i have dealt with the four charges which the hon and learned attorney general made against me in his speech but he did not rely upon these merely but flourished a whole bundle of forged letters in the face of the court as well now sir i have dealt fully with the question of the forged letters on a former occasion in this house what i have to say so far as my doings and proceedings go outside the question of these forged letters is that there is not one single true statement which was then made by the hon and learned attorney general and which is made in the pamphlet called parnellism and crime which is not an open and notorious matter which is not recorded in every public journal of the day as having taken place and for ascertaining the accuracy of which you require no commission they are open and on record and everybody has his opinion in regard to my acts and utterances if it was a question of opinion i grant you the case might be different but you do not appoint a commission to inquire into questions of opinion but into matters of fact i come then to the forged letters we have had from mr egan recently as i ventured to predict we should have the fullest and most complete denial coupled with absolute evidence of their falsity that any man could have given with regard to such productions as to the letter to which my signature was attached and which is alleged to have been in the handwriting of mr henry campbell my private secretary i have seen during the last few days my late private secretary mr henry campbell who was dangerously ill during the trial but who nevertheless would have taken his place in the witness box at any risk to his life in order to refute the calumnies of the hon and learned attorney general if the trial had gone on and he assures me of the fact of which i was already aware that the handwriting of the body of the letter bears not the slightest resemblance to his i wish to ask the hon and learned attorney general a simple question whether he ever personally himself compared any of mr campbell admitted handwriting with the handwriting of the forged letters did he or did he not sir richard webster made no sign i think that is a fairly plain question to which the hon and learned attorney general if his conscience was easy might have nodded or shaken his head i will ask him another question which he perhaps will find more difficult to answer did he ever learn from the times the source from which they got those letters before he the legal adviser of the government consented to link his fortunes and those of his party and government with those infamous productions if he did not take those precautions i do not think he will be absolved from the charge of rushing blindfold into accusations of such infamy against his brother members of this house without that due examination and inquiry which a man in his high and learned position ought to have used well sir the object of all this is perfectly plain it is evident to the government and to the hon and learned gentleman and to the times from all their utterances during the last few days that the case of the forged letters is going to break down and they want to divert the inquiry of the royal commission into other channels if they have anything to say against me let them appoint a commission by all means to inquire into my actions and i know i shall come out untarnished from their scrutiny if they have anything to say against the land league and any reasons why this inquiry should be gone into although they themselves never proposed it or thought of it during all these long years let them come down to the house and say we think the proceedings of the land league ought to be investigated and we propose a commission but i sir will be no party to letting the government by a side wind under the pretext of investigating my doings enter into such an inquiry as this which must undoubtedly extend over a very long period of time why sir these four charges that the hon and learned attorney general made against me were matters of notoriety they were known to lord carnarvon in when he sought an interview with me in an empty house in london they were known to lord salisbury a month or two later when he spoke in his speech at newport of the irish chieftain an hon member the irish chief mr parnell when he referred to me as the irish chief when he expressed the wish and hope that it might be possible that ireland might have restored to her some small portion of her lost legislative independence by the adoption of the colonial model these things were all known to the old tory party and the tory government of when you deliberately abandoned coercion asked for no inquiry into the land league and said through the mouth of lord carnarvon that you would try another and a better way in the dealings of england with ireland nothing new has happened from that day to this to create suspicion or to point any additional charge against me except the production of these forged letters i shall call for the production of evidence in support of those charges and for the production of the forged letters i call upon the government to limit the scope of this commission to what the right hon gentleman avowed in his reply to a question he was going to limit it namely to charges and allegations made against myself and other members of this house i ask that the bill shall exclude other persons and name specifically any member of parliament charged i ask that the bill shall provide that the commission is not only to be one conducted by judges but that it shall also be a judicial inquiry i ask that the bill shall provide that i and my parliamentary colleagues as the persons accused shall have the power at the commencement of the proceedings of opening our case by counsel and conducting it as in a judicial proceeding for libel if that be not so the commission might call any witnesses they pleased in any order they pleased they might refuse to call witnesses whom we considered urgent they might refuse to do many things which would be necessary for the conduct of our case and this is not provided for in the bill as it stands i ask fourthly that the bill shall provide for a definite specification of the charges made against me i say that if this is not done it would be open to the commission under the imputations made in parnellism and crime and in the statement of the hon and learned attorney general to go into the history of every outrage that has occurred in ireland and every speech that has been made by every member of the land league in england ireland scotland and america before it came to the question of the authenticity of the forged letters and i ask finally that the bill shall provide for the discovery of documents et c before the commencement of the inquiry it is obvious that it will be of vital importance for us to have facilities for seeing these documents before the commission commences to sit not only for seeing them but for taking photographs of them and for having them examined by experts for according to the statement of the hon and learned attorney general these statements have been in the hands of his experts for weeks and weeks and we want them to be in the hands of ours now sir i think i have made out my case that in asking the house to adopt this bill the government under pretext of appointing a commission to inquire into the conduct of myself and my hon friends is appointing a commission which will not close its labours until it has inquired into every speech and every outrage that has ever been committed in ireland or elsewhere and that this is not a fair way of proceeding i have shown the absurdity of the case so far as disclosed in parnellism and crime and in the speech of the hon and learned attorney general in the late proceedings sought to be made against me i have shown it has no shadow of foundation that it consists of open and overt acts of speeches delivered in the full light of publicity and of proceedings about which there was no shadow of concealment whatever which were announced in all the newspapers and i say it is not fair decent english it is moreover i believe cowardly and unjust to ask us to accept such a measure in response to the claim i make in this house for an investigation into these infamous charges meaning no more than ordinary justice mr parnell apart from the forged letters mr parnell i beg the right hon gentleman pardon i really said nothing of the sort my contention is that in causing an inquiry into my proceedings you are inquiring into the proceedings of the land league i said if you wish to inquire into the proceedings of the land league frame your bill for that purpose mr parnell they are the only evidence\n",

      "mr parnell cork in rising to move the following amendment but humbly to represent to her majesty that the relations between the owners and occupiers of land in ireland have not been seriously disturbed in the cases of those owners who have granted to their tenants such abatements of rents as are called for by the state of prices of agricultural and pastoral produce and that the remedy for the existing crisis in irish agrarian affairs is not to be found in increased stringency of criminal procedure or in the pursuit of such novel doubtful and unconstitutional measures as have recently been taken by her majesty government in ireland but in such a reform of the law and the system of government as will satisfy the needs and secure the confidence of the irish people said mr speaker the amendment which i propose to move to the address deals with four points it states that disturbance between the owners and occupiers of land in ireland which is complained of in the address has not taken place where suitable concessions have been given to their tenants by owners and in this connection it will be my duty undoubtedly to attach serious blame to the government for the rejection of the tenants relief bill of last session which would have effectually prevented or have very much limited the disturbances which have taken place then sir secondly i point out that coercion will fail as it always has failed sooner or later in bringing about a better state of affairs in ireland whether between the owners and occupiers or in that larger field which i may call the international relations between the two countries if the intention of the government is to undertake coercion as is foreshadowed in the speech from the throne a coercion which is called by the euphonious name of an alteration or reform in criminal procedure the result will be that the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant will find himself at the top of a very unpleasant inclined plane and that he will speedily like oliver twist be found in this house asking for more coercion such as the right hon gentleman evidently contemplates in the queen speech is coercion against his political opponents in ireland he does not claim in fact he expressly denies and rather plumes himself on the fact that there has been an increase of crime in ireland during the last few months he claims on the contrary a large diminution of agrarian outrages what he wants is to tackle his political opponents in the country the authors of the plan of campaign and the speakers of open and advised speeches some of them are members of this house and they appear to have entered into a competition with her majesty government in ireland as to who should produce the best plan for taking a short cut to the better government of that country well sir if the right hon gentleman gets into this slippery path he will find himself unable to stop it will only be the beginning of his coercion all experience in ireland has shown that when you muzzle your political opponents and put them in gaol your work is only beginning and that open agitation and advised speaking having been stopped having been thrust under the surface the government is immediately face to face with the dreadful existence of secret societies and with the revival of agrarian and political crime in its worst forms and the chief secretary will find himself obliged to come to parliament like the late mr forster and require this house to provide him with newer and stronger weapons to deal with a state of affairs which his own action has brought about there is yet time the right hon gentleman may even now be dissuaded from entering upon this course of action and may be induced to rely rather upon the removal of grievances the amelioration of the condition of the people and the alteration of the system of government in ireland than upon those antiquated methods of procedure this yoke of coercion which always has created and always will create fresh obstacles and difficulties my amendment sir also complains that the government have been guilty of unusual doubtful and unconstitutional courses in ireland during the last few months at first sight it might be supposed that i was referring to the exercise of the dispensing power or the pressure which the right hon gentleman the chief secretary boasted at bristol that he had brought to bear against irish landlords this is not the case although i shall have to deal with that phase of the events of last winter later on although i shall have to point out that the government by the adoption of their plan of campaign and of this dispensing power have not cleared themselves from the blame which attaches to them for their rejection of the tenants relief bill yet i do not propose to criticize the government for that part of their course in ireland it was the best thing under the circumstances for the government to do sir it was a very poor attempt at government but although it was a poor attempt although the authors of the plan of campaign had no difficulty whatever in outshining them and in concocting a better plan of action and one with far greater and more successful results than that of the government of the queen yet it was the only thing that was left for the unfortunate chief secretary to do and he did it with the best materials at his command certainly he was ably assisted by the gentlemen he pressed into his service sir redvers buller county court judge curran captain plunkett and the other officials who helped him in this dispensing power but the blame is not in that direction it is rather in the direction of the actions illegal unusual and outside the law which they committed in their attempts in the other direction in the direction of upholding what they called the law in ireland i will refer to a few only of their mistakes i cannot go over the whole of their misdeeds within the last few months i should weary and detain the house too much by the recital i shall only refer to some of the more leading mistakes as fair examples of the rest to begin with let me mention their invocation of the inherent jurisdiction of the court of queen bench in ireland against an alleged political offender my hon friend the member for east mayo mr dillon they wanted to take a short cut towards the maintenance of law and order in ireland and in attempting to do so they did what is without precedent even in the government of that country it is the first time that what is called the inherent jurisdiction of the court of queen bench has been invoked for the purpose of securing a rule of bail against the offender the government were guilty of a mean unprecedented and unconstitutional action in attempting to deprive the hon gentleman the member for east mayo of his liberty there can be no doubt they thought he would not be able to get bail and that they would thus be able to shut him up in prison instead of bringing him before the ordinarily constituted courts of law and trying him before a judge and jury well sir let me refer also to the proclamation of the sligo meeting that meeting was called in a legal and constitutional manner and for a perfectly legal and constitutional purpose it was called for two purposes the first was to discuss the land question and the alteration in the law necessary to settle that question the second purpose was to protest against the illegal conduct of the sheriff of the county of sligo in wilfully breaking the law lord o'hagan jury act in no fewer than three particulars in the formation of the jury panel for the county of sligo these were both perfectly legitimate objects it was quite right for the people to discuss those questions and the alterations in the law that parliament ought to make and it was quite right while there was yet time that they should call attention to that illegal action and protest against it before the liberties of innocent persons had been sacrificed i may mention as a proof of the legality of the complaint that when the assizes commenced the question was brought before the judge by counsel for the prisoners the composition of the jury panel was defended and chief baron palles one of the highest legal authorities in ireland stated that in three separate particulars lord o'hagan jury act had been deliberately broken and that probably there was not a single man on the jury panel who would have been on it if the panel had been legally struck and either her majesty government or chief baron palles did what was equivalent to quashing the panel and the assize was postponed the government did not want this matter discussed up to the last the counsel for the crown supported the sheriff in his illegal action and the government had also supported him previously by proclaiming the sligo meeting which was called for the purposes i have mentioned on the legal question i should like to ask the irish law officers under what statute or authority it is the lord lieutenant claims to have power to proclaim meetings called for such purposes in ireland we have had examples of the proclamation of meetings by magistrates when meetings have been prevented by armed forces but in a recent decision of the superior courts of this country it has been held that magistrates have not the right to stop a public meeting in your english history a right of public meeting was asserted by the sacrifice of lives and the spilling of much blood at peterloo in ireland we have always on such occasions overwhelming forces of military and police to contend with we have never been able to assert our right of public meeting in the same fashion but i wish to ask on what authority by what law and statute and if by common law under what judicial decisions did the government in ireland proclaim this sligo meeting they not only proclaimed the meeting which after the proclamation no attempt was made to hold but the day before that on which the meeting was to have been held when the high sheriff of dublin who is one of the magistrates for the division of the county in which the town of sligo is situate had gone down to the town of sligo and was proceeding to the town hall in company of the mayor of sligo who was also a county magistrate for the purpose of consulting together with their friends as to the action that ought to be taken in view of the government proclamation these gentlemen and the persons who accompanied them were violently attached by the police under the shadow of the town hall while they were waiting for the purpose of securing the key of that building and a large number of persons were seriously injured one of them mr john or nicholas devine having had his skull fractured and being still in a very precarious and dangerous condition owing to the assault for this there has been no redress and i do not suppose there will be any i should like also to ask the government why mr devine skull was fractured now sir i also complain of the jury panel in sligo which i condemn as one way about as good as could be chosen to induce the irish people to despise and dislike the administration of the law what are the facts of this jury panel at the connaught winter assizes on a jury panel where more than one half of the jurors the persons summoned as jurors were roman catholics and in a province where nine tenths of the population are catholics three juries were struck for the trial of agrarian cases on which not a single roman catholic was allowed to be put a fourth jury was struck on which there was only one roman catholic who was a bailiff and under the influence of the landlords and yet sir the government expect the irish people to believe in the justness of the administration of the law where three fourths of the population of the whole country and nine tenths of the population of the county are only allowed one single representative on juries to try political and agrarian cases no wonder that when by some chance a catholic or two manage to get upon a jury they should disagree with the protestant jurors now sir there is another example of the meanness because i cannot invent a less hard and harsh term for their conduct in ireland there is another example of the meanness of the government administration when after an interval of two months they had failed to put the hon member for east mayo into gaol by the short cut of invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the queen bench and when they had at length taken proceedings to bring him to trial before a judge and a jury they initiated these proceedings in the city of dublin but after the magistrate had returned the cases for trial the crown came to the conclusion that they would get a better and more subservient jury in the county of dublin the jury panel in that county being very largely composed of half pay english officers and other retired government officials who might be depended upon to exhibit the least possible amount of prejudice against a man of the political proclivities of my hon friend the member for east mayo consequently they had recourse to an obsolete statute which never i believe had in modern times been used for the purpose and removed the case by change of venue from the city of dublin to the county all i can say is that if the crown succeed in convicting my hon friend by the adoption of such a mean trick as that neither the justice of the verdict nor the validity of the proceedings will be recognized by an irishman worthy of the name it is one of the shabbiest and most miserable exhibitions of trickery and dodgery which had ever disgraced the carrying out of british misrule in ireland i sympathize deeply with a government which finds itself reduced to such deplorable straits as to be obliged to hit its political opponents below the belt i have said that i do not intend to condemn the government for their dispensing action in ireland but i have also said that this dispensing action cannot be held to shield them from the consequence of their rejection of the tenants relief bill of last session a rejection which is the source and origin of all their troubles was there a necessity for the reduction of rents claimed by the relief bill the government said that there was not and they invited their followers with a light heart to throw the bill out they did throw it out but will they say so now will anybody contend in the face of the governmental action last winter so far as we have been able to disclose it as yet but we have by no means got to the bottom of it will anybody contend that there was not a necessity for large and general reduction of rent i do not think that anybody will because things have been going from bad to worse the fall of prices has continued and shown no sign yet of stopping we are face to face with a front bench which has no plan of reform for ireland no plan of amelioration for the tenants no plan for easing the relations between landlord and tenant except their own stumbling shifting and broken kneed processes carried out through the instrumentality of sir redvers buller judge curran and others who so distinguished themselves last winter in competition with my hon friend the member for east mayo i proposed in the relief bill that this law and order government should proceed legally and constitutionally that it should first amend the law where it was shown to require amendment and they admitted by their action afterwards in ireland that it did require amendment that the law having been amended they should have gone to work deliberately before judicial officials appointed for the purpose and with great experience in dealing with these cases to decide after the tenant had paid one half of his rent and arrears whether there was really a need for a reduction or a remission as regards the remainder in that way you would have done something to train the irish people in that respect for law and order which her majesty government profess to be so desirous to see instilled in their minds but the government tried a short cut again and sent judge curran and sir redvers buller to the county of kerry why were these distinguished people above all others sent to the county of kerry i suppose it was for the purpose of still further persuading the people of the virtue of the observance of law and order the county of kerry happened to be not the most rack rented county in ireland but it was the county in which there had been the greatest disturbance and the greatest number of agrarian outrages and in which moonlighting had been rifest and most rampant this was the county which the government chose for their operations i suppose they did so for the purpose of teaching the lesson to the rest of ireland that where the tenants had made things absolutely unbearable as they had done in kerry where life and property were unsafe and where moonlighters were ransacking all parts of the county this was the place chosen by her majesty law and order government for the purpose of exceptionally favouring the tenants and bringing about reductions in their rents wholesale and sweeping reductions as i shall show by and by which by the rejection of the relief bill they had refused to the rest of ireland because it was quiet because there were no outrages and which they provided special machinery for in the case of kerry but had provided no machinery for in the case of the rest of ireland the government have alleged as an excuse for their conduct in the rejection of the relief bill that it was only applicable to judicial tenancies and leaseholds and would not have reached the smaller tenants such as those at glenbeigh well sir i should have been only too glad to have extended the bill in committee to the rest of the tenantry i undoubtedly did err on the side of modesty and i am sorry for it i erred on the side of modesty and moderation in making my bill too small but that is not an argument which the government is entitled to use it was an argument which anybody was entitled to use against them on the motion for a second reading because the bill might have been amended in committee i should have been only too glad to remedy this or any other blot it has been said that the condition of the smaller tenantry of which glenbeigh affords an example was so desperate that they owed so many years arrears that they would have been unable to comply with the condition of the bill namely the payment of half the rent and arrears now this is not so the bill would amply have met the smaller class of tenants the glenbeigh estate although typical in most respects of the condition of the congested or smaller tenanted estates of the country is not typical of it in respect of the number of years arrears which were due the number of years arrears on the glenbeigh estate was owing to exceptional circumstances which do not exist on the great majority of irish estates it was owing to the fact that the original owner and the mortgagees had been in contention and had served notices on each other and had served notices on the tenants not to pay any rent both claimants to this estate had adopted a sort of no rent manifesto and the tenants in this case had obeyed and did not pay any rent for a number of years but as regards the greater number of estates in a similar position the rents are paid up every year so far as the tenants are able to pay and no great number of years of arrears exist undoubtedly the great majority of the tenants by borrowing and scraping money together would have been able to deposit the per cent rent and arrears therefore the example of the glenbeigh estate is not at all applicable it is said that the landlords had made a generous offer on the glenbeigh estate the generous offer made originally was that they should pay the whole five years arrears with costs in august immediately after the present landlord had established his claim to the estate he issued notices that he had established it in september he took ejectment proceedings against the tenants in the county court of kerry and in october these proceedings came on for trial thus only giving the tenants one month to find five years arrears before he proceeded to pile up costs in most cases amounting to two or two and a half years rent in addition it was this harsh conduct on the part of the landlord which ultimately prevented a settlement being arrived at there can be no doubt that the tenants would have accepted the final offer of payment of half a year rent if it had been free from the condition of paying costs which amounted to two or two and a half years rent and the infliction of these costs rendered it quite impossible to accept the apparently generous offer which was made hence the evictions and house burnings and the other features of the case in this case the relief bill would have stepped in but not even judge curran with all the wide dispensing powers which he assumed could prevent the tenants from being mulcted in these costs the decree having carried with it the infliction of costs which they had no power to pay if my bill had been accepted proceedings would have been stopped before the case came into court by the payment of per cent of rent and arrears and thus an insurmountable barrier of costs as in the case of glenbeigh would never have been created it is also alleged in defence of the conduct of the landlord of the glenbeigh estate that it was the action of the national league which prevented a settlement now sir the national league never interfered with the glenbeigh case at all until the evictions were in full swing it was not until five houses had been burnt that the hon member for one of the divisions of kerry appeared on the scene for the first time war had been commenced by the landlord and trustees at that time and the atrocities which have fixed public attention in this country had been committed the plan of campaign has not been adopted on the glenbeigh estate to this very day but i have no hesitation in saying that if it had been adopted in time there would have been no house burning and no evictions the essence of the plan of campaign and it has been very much criticized is that all the tenants should stand together and those who can pay should refuse to pay until those who cannot pay should get a fair settlement that is its most important feature and without it the tenants who cannot pay would be evicted and their houses would be burned and levelled at glenbeigh solvent tenants on the estate have paid nine of them being members of the local committee of the national league where then is the evidence that the national league has interfered or that the plan of campaign has been adopted i am not dealing with the rectitude of the plan of campaign i am simply showing that if it had been adopted these houses at glenbeigh would never have been burnt the homesteads would never have been levelled and the civilized world would not have been shocked at this fresh example of the government of law and order in gaining the affections of the irish people now sir what does general buller say of the poverty of these people in his letter to messrs darley and roe on november why that most of the tenants are nearer famine than the payment of rent i will now return to the government proceedings during the winter they refused the relief bill and having done so the chief secretary and my hon friend the member for east mayo hurried over post haste to ireland to put into operation their respective plans of campaign the experience of history has too often shown that in ireland nothing is to be gained by respect for law and order by reliance upon constitutional methods and by looking to parliament for the redress of grievances but i confess i was in hopes at the end of last session that a government which had been returned for the express purpose of showing that ireland could be justly governed at westminster would properly attend to her wants but instead of that we have the old lesson that we must not look to this house for justice but the majority of this house those who call themselves liberal unionists and conservative unionists showed their determination to accept nothing which i brought forward not because it was bad in itself but because i had brought it forward the mere fact of the authorship of that bill plainly indicated to their minds that it must be a dishonest bill concealing some deeply laid plot against the integrity of the union therefore they rejected the bill the government had then no alternative but the adoption of the course which they followed they sent judge curran to kerry judge curran is a gentleman against whom i do not wish to say anything and if i do say anything which may appear to be hostile to him my excuse must be that i do not intend to be hostile to him judge curran was a judge who was bound by the exigencies of the office which he held to avoid all communication with either of the parties to a suit which might come before him he was bound to have no previous knowledge of the particulars of the cases brought before him but he put aside such antiquated notions and went to the parties to suits he saw the landlords and tried to dissuade them from suing their tenants and being in some cases successful he came on the bench and announced when the suits came on for hearing that he had the power to make reductions to the tenants in fact exhibited himself as the general saviour of the county of kerry and invited all disputants to come to him like the man who beats the drum outside an itinerant circus he called out walk up walk up gentlemen and see what splendid reductions i will give you and the tenants flocked to his court hoping to get these reductions in a letter to the bishop of kerry judge curran said i went to kerry with an honest and determined desire to do justice and if possible to restore the district to its normal state of peace i was determined that juries should convict in cases in which guilt was brought home to the parties but a judge cannot give effect to any such determination a judge has no power to make a jury convict if the jury does not choose to convict judge curran also said that he was determined to remove the cause of crime by preventing the oppression of tenants who were willing but unable to meet the landlords demands but judge curran had no power to do this parliament might have done it but he could not he said that he was powerless except in cases in which tenants came before him and explained the position he was however powerless in all cases except by the consent of the landlords without their consent he had no power to reduce the rent or to strike off a penny of the costs he had no real power to do anything except postpone the execution of decrees for a very short period but he assumed greater powers in his letter he intimated that he should not stoop to deny that he was not acting in league with the landlords or by the direction of the government but as he admits in a subsequent part of his letter that he has had interviews with sir redvers buller on the subject of the remission of rents i may leave the house to judge of the worth of this denial as this letter shows throughout the belief of judge curran that a large reduction of rents in kerry was urgently needed i wish to ask the government whether they still think that they did right in rejecting the tenants relief bill and whether they still hold that they were right when that measure was before the house in suggesting that no reduction of rents was needed judge curran actually attempted to do things which he had no legal power to do i do not blame him because the emergency was great parliament had just made a great mistake and the government a terrible blunder and it was his duty as their loyal officer to do what he could to cover these errors with regard to the proceedings and sayings of general buller the greatest secrecy has been maintained and whenever any awkward fact came out it was stoutly denied till the proof became so positive that the denial could be no longer maintained some light however has been thrown upon his action there was first the publication of a telegram from the sub sheriff of cork to county inspector moriarty who was with sir redvers buller in county kerry asking for extra police protection the reply of mr moriarty to this request was known he refused to send the constables saying that days notice must be given before such a demand could be entertained and that information must be sent as to the nature of the proceedings the names of the parties concerned being given by this it is plain that before police protection would be granted general buller required to know whether the proceedings were for the eviction of tenants on account of arrears of rent or for the recovery of ordinary debts also the names of the parties to be evicted so that he might ascertain whether there existed any circumstances of hardship justifying the exercise of a dispensing power we have next a portion of general buller evidence before lord cowper commission and this is very remarkable as showing the need for the relief bill and the lunacy of the government in rejecting it the account of the witness evidence was published in the newspapers and purported to have appeared in a letter written by one of the commissioners to a friend in london it represented general buller as saying that the tenants were over rented that they could not pay the rents that the law was all on the side of the landlords that he had been obliged to intervene to save tenants from hardship that the national league was the saviour of the people that before its existence the tenants had no friends and that a stop should be put to unjust evictions from the day of the publication of this account to the present nobody so far as i know has denied that it is correct when examined in the recent proceedings before the police magistrate in dublin general buller excused himself from replying to questions upon this subject by saying that he had not yet received a copy of the shorthand writer notes of his evidence i am afraid that since his connection with dublin castle general buller has learnt not to be quite candid association with the irish officials has apparently done him no good we have lately received trustworthy information of which we challenge the contradiction that general buller is now being asked by the commission to amend his evidence and that this portion of his original evidence will not appear in the official report the next thing we know about general buller is disclosed in the correspondence with captain plunkett with reference to a tenant in limerick who was president of the local branch of the national league and who when about to be evicted appealed to general buller for protection general buller recommended him to captain plunkett care and shortly afterwards a letter appeared in the times signed erigena the agent of the estate complained that captain plunkett had called upon them to urge them to give the tenants a receipt for the three and a half years rent due and to forgive the costs incurred on payment of one year rent and they said they were given to understand that should they refuse to grant these terms they would not be given police protection at the evictions in another letter he urged the landlord to accept the rent offered said that the majority of the tenants were nearer famine than the payment of rent and that unless the landowner agreed to a settlement he could not support evictions there can be no doubt that general buller and other officers and government officials had repeatedly led landlords in ireland to believe that protection would not be given in cases where unjust evictions were made it was unquestionably the opinion of the chief secretary from the speech which he recently made at bristol that strong pressure was necessary to induce many landlords to do what was right and he spoke of the pressure he was exercising i think the phrase about the exercise of pressure was an unfortunate one to use because if it is legitimate for a minister who has deliberately rejected an alteration of the law on the ground that no pressure is necessary that the landlords will do of their own accord what should be done to go over to ireland to exercise pressure on the landlords and to prevent them doing what is in their strict legal right to do then i say there may be other men more interested in the welfare of the irish people than the right hon gentleman men who are more disinterested because they have not to prop up the miserable attempts at government which have been made in ireland there may be irishmen who may be pardoned for thinking that they too are justified in exercising pressure on the landlords to do what is right and just it has been alleged or suggested in her majesty speech that the relations between landlord and tenant have been disturbed by the plan of campaign now as one who is in no sense responsible for the bringing forward of this plan of campaign i am inclined to speak freely and fairly with regard to the matter and i deny in the strongest terms that there is any foundation whatever for that statement i believe on the contrary that had it not been for the plan of campaign many poor tenants who have now roofs over their heads would have been cast out on the bare hillside as the glenbeigh tenants were i believe that the reduction in the number of evictions from to in the last quarter has been mainly due to the action of the plan of campaign no doubt in a secondary sense it has also been due to the exercise of a dispensing power on the part of the government these efforts on the part of the government and on the part of my hon friend the member for east mayo mr dillon have induced many unjust and hard landlords to make concessions who would not otherwise have done so and therefore sir so far from the plan of campaign having disturbed the relations between landlord and tenant the fact that up to a very recent time there had not been a single eviction on any estate where the plan had been adopted by all the tenantry is very good testimony to the circumstance that instead of leading to outrages it has pacified the country it is evident indeed that the government and the authors of the plan of campaign are aiming and have been aiming at precisely the same thing only the government have not been quite so successful as their rivals it is a remarkable fact that for nearly two months after the plan of campaign had been published the government refrained from taking any action against it or expressing any opinion that it was illegal the plan was published on the 23rd of october and it was not until the week before christmas two months later that the government moved in the matter that was the first intimation which was given to the irish people that the plan of campaign was illegal did the government know before this that it was illegal had their law officers informed them before this that it was illegal if not why did they not do so and if they did why did not the government communicate their information to the public if the government believed that the plan of campaign was illegal knowing that the general opinion in ireland was that the movement was perfectly legal and that it was held that that opinion had been confirmed by their own attorney general i say it was their duty to speak out at once and to warn the tenants why did the right hon gentleman wait for two months before he issued his proclamation it is useless to point to the proceedings against the hon member for east mayo because these were not proceedings against the plan of campaign but against certain speeches made by the hon gentleman and i believe that to this day no proceedings have been taken against any tenant under the plan of campaign but why this delay is it that the government felt that they could not fully rely on their own pressure on the landlords and wanted the assistance of the hon member for east mayo and that the exertions of judge curran and sir redvers buller in the exercise of their dispensing power to reduce rents which by the bye they had no right to reduce were insufficient was it that the righ hon gentleman felt that without the aid of the plan of campaign his pressure on the landlords would not have been strong enough that evictions would have increased and that he would not have been able to come back to the house of commons and say that his policy had been successful are those the reasons why he winked at the plan of campaign if not what are the reasons if they had determined to intervene with the strong arm of what is called the law in ireland they should not have let the irish people commit themselves to all the consequences of the plan sir as far as i can make out the government and the authors of the plan of campaign are aiming at one and the same thing and i can assign no other reason for the late action of the government in ireland in this matter at the eleventh hour than that they got jealous of the hon member for east mayo and mr william o'brien because they were more successful in their efforts than they were themselves and sir there is evidence to show that the plan of campaign was worked with more moderation by its authors than the course adopted by the government in imitation of it and those who worked that plan took up no case in which there was not a clear necessity for reduction in rent moreover they tried to bring about a settlement in every case in which there was a fair offer of reduction there was no imitation of the helter skelter harum scarum slapdash proceedings of judge curran and general buller on the part of the authors of the plan of campaign and all cases were carefully investigated before action was taken let me direct the attention of the house to the estates of lord dillon and lord dunsandle the dillon estate is about the best instance of a congested estate on a large scale it is tenanted by a great number of small tenants who used to come to england every year for the purpose of earning a few pounds to meet their annual rents at the time of the passing of the arrears act the estate was in a condition of frightful confusion with several years of rent owing fortunately the arrears act was passed and that afforded the poor tenants some means of escape from the predicament in which they were if this estate had not been taken in hand by the authors of the plan of campaign and a settlement forced on the landlord the horrors of glenbeigh would have been repeated on them a thousandfold the class of tenants is almost the same as at glenbeigh but fortunately we have been spared that the same thing may be said of lord dunsandle estate which is also inhabited by very impoverished tenants although their condition is not quite so desperate these and some other cases in which a settlement has not been arrived at are fair examples of the necessity which existed for pressure of some kind or other on the landlord and they are also examples of the moderation with which settlements were effected as soon as landlords showed any disposition to come to a settlement as regards the legality or illegality of the plan of campaign i have said that the irish public are entitled to know without loss of time whether in the opinion of the government the plan is legal or not i can attach no weight whatever to the judgment of the court of queen bench or the government proclamation under the circumstances of the case the government action has been so clouded by dodgery and by subterfuge that i reserve to myself the right to wait until i see what the decision as to the legality of this plan is in the trial which is about to take place the legality of the plan is a matter on which if i had been in a position to concern myself about it i should have desired to be satisfied first of all i should have thought it necessary to take the opinion of counsel myself and i am informed that counsel has given an opinion in favour of the legality and constitutional principle of the plan of campaign but however that may be the conduct of the government stands condemned first of all for waiting two months before expressing an opinion and secondly by removing the case out of the court in which it was originated to one in county dublin where they expected to get a subservient jury and thirdly by attempting to take proceedings by a short cut before the queen bench thus enabling that court to express an opinion on certain speeches and upon the plan of campaign which was not before the court at all and with regard to which there was no evidence whatever now some hard words have been used towards the gentlemen who are concerned in this rival attempt to bring pressure to bear upon the irish landlords lord salisbury and conservative and liberal unionist speakers have likened them to robbers and embezzlers they do not do well or wisely who talk of robbery or embezzlement in connection with the irish land question those gentlemen who talk so glibly forget that almost every title to irish land is founded on wholesale robbery and embezzlement they forget that a great portion of the land of ireland has been confiscated no fewer than three several times over they forget that all improvements in the land with very few exceptions have been made by the tenants and that so far as the land has derived value from such improvements that value should by law be the property of the tenants they forget that for centuries the landlords have been coolly robbing confiscating and embezzling the increased value of the land it is not well or wise therefore that the supporters of the irish landlords whether in or out of the house should talk about robbery or embezzlement these unwise words may give rise to unpleasant recollections my next proposition involves a condemnation of coercion as a remedy for the troubles of ireland i have said that resort to coercion is announced in the queen speech in the direction of increased stringency in criminal procedure we are informed that the proposed coercion will give power to stipendiary magistrates to convict for intimidation and that it will give power to empanel special juries and to change venues it is admitted that the coercion is to be used against open agitation and public speaking and writing the right hon gentleman like all other chief secretaries before him has thought that once he gets his political enemies into gaol and keeps them there he will be quite happy i wonder that he has not been warned by the case of his predecessor the late mr forster commenced by only wanting an act it was rather the converse of the case of the right hon gentleman but the two situations became similar in the end for dealing with village tyrants and dissolute ruffians whom he said the police knew all about and could lay their hands upon at a moment notice he wanted to put these men into prison and keep them there as long as he wished he got the act but he failed to find the tyrants and ruffians at least he failed to put them into prison but instead of that he put into prison of the popular leaders of ireland including two clergymen seven members of parliament several town councillors many poor law guardians and a large number of substantial merchant s and traders shopkeepers and farmers and when he had done all this he found that he wanted more power for the exasperations fed and nurtured by those high handed proceedings produced their inevitable result a secret conspiracy had grown up under the very nose of the chief secretary armed with all those great powers of summary arrest and imprisonment a conspiracy directed against his own life which he knew nothing about and which he was unable to cope with and similar conspiracies existed throughout ireland against the lives of landlords and government officials those conspiracies did not come into existence until mr forster had commenced his career of coercion to stamp out constitutional agitation but the inevitable result of driving discontent under the surface whether in ireland or elsewhere followed mr forster appealed to his cabinet for increased powers they refused then came the terrible tragedy in the phœnix park and it was followed by the passing of the crimes act the most stringent coercive enactment both against political agitation and crime ever passed against ireland by england this act was administered under the most favourable circumstances of a partial revival of agricultural prospects by lord spencer with great determination but with very partial success and its administration was answered from america by dynamite and other attempts at assassination and conspiracy dynamite was repeatedly exploded in the crowded streets of your city your public buildings were also threatened and attempts were made to destroy them even in this house the ministers of the day were not safe from violent attack and attempts to assassinate by the discharge of explosive bombs from the strangers gallery and exasperation and international animosity reached a most deplorable height of which i think you would have to go back to to rind any example and after all these terrible events after all this loss of life some upon the scaffold many more the victims of the wild justice of revenge after all this peril to your citizens pursuing their lawful occupations in the streets after all this danger to your most distinguished ministers what was the result a tory government came into office and abandoned coercion there can be no betwixt and between in this matter and the right hon gentleman may depend upon it that although he may get his coercion act to strike down his chief political opponents he will not be able to stop murder you will be hurried on from one step to another your first coercion will necessitate more coercion and you will have to make your choice between such measures of repression as the czar of russia employs or you will never be able to administer it so long as you keep the irish members here i trust that her majesty government who are at present free agents as to their future conduct will before they embark on this course ponder these facts i have not sought to make any appeals to their fears if i have referred to ancient history it has been to point a moral as to the uselessness of the course on which they appear resolved to embark i believe that if they will refrain from a policy of exasperation even now at the eleventh hour and stop the infliction of injustice in ireland but stop it by legislative measures and not by the exercise of a dispensing power which i believe to have demoralized the irish people and especially the irish tenants during the last winter more than all the exertions of the fenian agitators from new york to san francisco if the government are warned in time and do what is just and right in a just and right way they may devise some scheme for the self government of ireland which from the declarations they have made they evidently have not either the time or the inclination or the ability to do which will meet all the legitimate wants and wishes of the irish people a self governed ireland when she makes her own laws will show by her tranquil and peaceful character how unfairly she has been treated and how libellous are the assertions that the irish are not a law abiding people i beg sir to move the amendment that stands in my name\n",

      "mr parnell cork in rising to move the amendment of which he had given notice said i am glad sir we are now in a position for the first time to debate the motion of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of ireland mr a j balfour with some sort of an approach to completeness of information it was not until last night that this house and the country were put in possession of the general and complete policy of the government in its nakedness and its dishonesty the proceedings last night sir in another place revealed to us the extent of the plot and the gravity of the conspiracy by which it is intended by the tory party and the liberal unionists on the one side to coerce if possible the tenants of ireland into the payment of impossible rents and on the other side to compel the purchase of the landlords interest at exorbitant prices at prices which if this house puts it into the power of the government to coerce the irish people under this bill will most certainly lead to a repudiation on a wholesale scale and to great loss to the british taxpayer sir up to the present we have only had the coercion side the direct coercion side of the government but last night we were treated in another place to what i may call the indirect coercion side of the government a species of coercion which under the pretext of conferring benefits on the irish people stabs them in the back a species of coercion which under the guise of friendship inflicts a most deadly injury now sir when last session i asked the government and this house to intervene in the crisis which i saw very well was approaching in irish affairs when i begged and implored of them this newly elected parliament full of fresh members who could not complain of the fatigue of a recent session as a reason for a speedy holiday when i entreated this house to postpone its holiday for a while in order to bring about some modus vivendi to enable the irish tenants to pass through the coming winter i was met with the statement that the government had appointed a select commission to inquire into the land question and that when they received its report they would act on it i predicted sir that if you waited for the winter you would find things very much entangled and so far gone before you met again that you would be called upon by the ministry not to carry out the recommendations of the royal commission in the direction of land reform but to pass a coercion bill of unexampled stringency and most drastic provisions and unhappily i have not proved to be a false prophet i wish it had been otherwise and the government in this house are pressing on their coercion with almost indecent haste on the other hand they have refused to carry out the recommendations of the royal commission it is impossible for us to consider this question of the state of ireland without inquiry into the sufficiency of the projects of the government with regard to remedial legislation i say that these projects as announced to us last night stand condemned by the report of their own commission for their insufficiency to meet the justice of the situation and the gravity of the tenants case what did the land commission recommend they made three main or principal recommendations the first of all was that the judicial term should be shortened from to five years they recommended in the second place that leaseholders should be admitted to the benefits of the land act and the third recommendation was that the holders of town parks should be constituted present tenants and should on application be admitted to have a fair rent fixed with the exception of the admission of the leaseholders to the benefits of the land act the government have absolutely thrown overboard the other two recommendations of the commission that is to say that out of the three main or principal recommendations the government have only adopted one they have declined to shorten the judicial term of tenancy from years to five they have declined to admit the occupiers of the town parks to the benefit of the land act of and have contented themselves with a mere modification of the definition which will go a very small distance in the required direction but the two recommendations of the royal commission are quite as important for their negative side as for their positive side we have heard a great deal of the land proposals of the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham mr joseph chamberlain how he has bent his great talent and knowledge of ireland to the construction of a land purchase bill i am not at all sure that within the last months the right hon gentleman has not constructed several land purchase bills each successive one different to the previous one sir we are told now that he has constructed a land purchase bill and he has sold this land purchase bill to the government the conditions being that the government have purchased this land purchase bill from him in exchange for his vote in other words it is not a case of two fools meeting her majesty government have been the wiser of the two because they have given no value whatever the two important considerations made by the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham being that the government should accept his land purchase bill and he is to vote in favour of the coercion bill the right hon gentleman is wedded to his idea of the substitution of small local authorities for the central authority contemplated by the bill of the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian mr w e gladstone and we may assume although we have not been favoured with any details as to the purchase bill of the government we may assume that the land purchase bill of the government will be in the direction of that of the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham at all events they will be very ungrateful to him if it be not so but what does the royal commission say with regard to this point they say in paragraph of their report we have found an all but unanimous opinion against the expectation that any satisfactory result would follow from the introduction of local authorities as guarantors in ordinary or congested districts and the evidence shows that these authorities would decline such responsibility further on they say in another paragraph we think that much caution should be exercised with dealing with small tenants as purchasers of their holdings so that the royal commission expressly warned the government against fathering the bill of the right hon member for west birmingham they point out that it would be dangerous so far as it was operative and that in all probability it would only be operative to a very small extent well then sir dual ownership is to be abolished in the permanent bill of the government the second bill of the government and it is to be abolished i suppose by the guarantee of these local authorities in ireland which has been condemned by the royal commission so that we find not only do the government refuse to carry out the positive recommendations of the royal commission but they also absolutely disregarded its warnings in these two matters which they advise them not to do but sir i would turn for a moment to the proposal for dealing with the present exigencies of the case the situation in ireland i have pointed out that it is not the intention of the government to adopt the principal recommendation of the royal commission based upon the evidence which they received that the judicial term of the tenancy should be shortened in length from years to five and here we find that again the trail of the right hon member for west birmingham appears to stain the ground the ill omened word bankruptcy is introduced and the example which is supposed to have been set by the successful workings of the bankruptcy bill of the right hon gentleman is to be invoked in reference to the case of the distressed irish tenants in other words bankruptcy courts are to be set up wholesale right left and centre all over ireland in order that the irish tenants may be turned into bankrupts these bankruptcy courts are to be composed of county court judges to them is to be given the duty of deciding the great number of intricate and difficult matters which from the nature of the case it will be entirely impossible for these gentlemen either to have knowledge of or time to consider or adjudicate upon these county court judges are limited in number and i admit they have not a great deal of work to do thanks to the freedom from litigation of the mercantile and of the prominent classes in ireland there is not much for these county court judges to do but what do you propose to do now as part of your remedial legislation you propose to give to these county court judges the duty of deciding whether irish tenants are in the first instance persons of good character whether in the second place their inability to pay rent is due to the fact that they have taken too much whiskey or that the land is too poor to produce the rent and in the third place what the fair rent is to be that they ought to pay in future a more monstrous proposal never entered into the brain of man mr parnell i shall keep strictly within the limits of your ruling sir but i would remind the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant that in a discussion upon a motion before a select committee of the whole house for inquiry into the state of ireland it is quite impossible to limit the nature of the discussion solely and entirely to the merits of the bill which the right hon gentleman proposes to ask the leave of the house to introduce we are under the necessity of inquiring into other branches of the irish constitution in order to see whether the proposals of the government as a whole are such as to free them from the necessity of agreeing to my amendment that is what i seek without referring to any bill which may be before the other house and without referring to the details or passages in debate which may have taken place in the other house i may say generally a more monstrous proposal whether it be the proposal of the right hon gentleman the member for west birmingham or whether it be the proposal of her majesty government than that which has been described to us namely that of these judges who have already some business to do although not a great deal to confide to them the duty not only of investigating the moral character of all the irish tenants who are not leaseholders but also the capacity of their farms to pay a higher or lower rent than that which they pay now was never heard of it is a proposal that is bound to break down from the very commencement and i can only suppose it was put forward because the government thought it was necessary for them to propose something in an ameliorative direction because they had proposed this coercive measure it is the old story it shows that in proportion to the severity of your coercion code the efficiency of your remedial measures will be diminished in proportion as you strike down irish liberties so will be the ratio of the lessened efficiency of the ameliorating courts such as the courts of the land commissioners and others you may establish in ireland for the redress of irish grievances as one of those who carefully watched the working of the land act of and who took some part in the agitation of the land league in those days i desire to give it as my solemn conviction that had it not been for the passage of the coercion act of the land act of that year would have been received in a very different and far better spirit by the irish people and the operations of the courts would not have been hampered by the criticism of the house of lords and the opprobrium of the landlord faction in ireland which intimidated these courts and prevented them from doing that justice to the irish tenants which they were established to do nay more sir i will go further than that and i will say i am convinced that the landlord party in the house of commons had not previously got the coercion act of passed they would have allowed a far better and more generous land act to have passed through both this house and the house of lords and that act would not have been foredoomed to failure by reason of its own inefficiency from the very moment of its birth if you handicap the irish tenants in their struggle against unjust rents if you throw the power into the landlords hands in ireland depend upon it your imperfect attempts to do justice to the tenants will be foredoomed to failure and that it will be impossible for them to contend against the obstacles which will be placed in their way sir i do not propose to deal fully with the question of the land bill which was introduced last night in another place but i will just say this the last general election turned to a large extent upon the question of the land proposals of the late government proposals to purchase out the tenant at the expense and at the risk of the state in the interests of the landlords and did more than any thing else to defeat and wreck the late ministry if there was one thing the electorate of great britain was against it was the loan of the credit of the state for the purpose of assisting the irish landlords and i am perfectly convinced from the development i have seen on the one hand of coercion and on the other hand the land legislation in another place that the very danger that the english and british electorate sought to avoid by rushing away from the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian and his plans they have leapt into by placing the present government into office and if they allow this coercion act to pass the last defence against the wholesale robbery of the british taxpayer will be removed there will be then nothing to prevent the exercise of landlord intimidation against the tenants in ireland they will be compelled in self defence and we have seen many instances of it already to buy their farms upon any terms that the landlords may force upon them the result of that the inevitable result must be loss to the british taxpayer because agriculture is at such a low ebb in ireland now as in england that the possibility of obtaining the rent out of the land has almost ceased to exist except in the very best classes of land if you attempt to float the landlords by means of state credit the result must surely be a wholesale repudiation of their obligations when this coercion shall have been removed by the tenants whom the landlords will have compelled to purchase at extravagant terms i have myself always desired to act honestly in respect of this question of land purchase i have always been identified with it ever since i took a prominent part in irish politics i think that the solution of the irish land question depends upon the purchase of their holdings by the tenants i was denounced as a robber in by the then prime minister who ridiculed the idea of any large scheme for enabling the irish tenants to purchase their holdings the late sir stafford northcote pointed out the danger there would be to the british taxpayer taking the place of these impoverished landlords in we the irish party were held up to public odium because we asked not that there might be a forced sale of all irish lands to the irish tenants but that a royal commission might have power to buy such estates in ireland as they considered necessary where strained relations might exist between landlords and tenants but from first to last i have never wavered or faltered for a single moment in the belief that in the direction of land purchase lies your hope of settling the irish land question i did not go i could not go with the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian in hoping or believing that his land act would prove a final solution or settlement of the difficulty although if it had been allowed to work by the house of lords and the landlord faction in ireland it would have gone very much nearer a solution than it hither to has done that has been our position to make the irish tenant the owner of his holding and we believe he will turn the sands into gold we believe that if this be done on a fair basis and a fair price in the absence of coercion not with coercion that the irish tenant will fulfil his obligations to the last penny for he would feel as one who drags a lessening instead of a lengthening chain behind him and the result will be satisfactory to the english nation and without any risk to the imperial exchequer but in the present proposals of the government there is wanting every element of future security and satisfaction so that what you give on the one hand you take away with the other and these unfortunate tenants and those who speak for them will subject themselves to the most terrible penalties if they venture to say a word against the ministerial view or the view of the landlords of ireland we shall be told during the debate that the government do not intend to do this and that they will not use the coercion act in such a manner that they do not intend to use it in this fashion or in that fashion but we know how these professions vanish when the government get the sharp sword into their hands i recollect it being said that mr forster coercion act of was not to be used except against those who directly incited to outrage and intimidation that it would be used only against village ruffians and not used against people who gave advice to tenants well sir i can give hundreds of instances of persons arrested under that act who did nothing whatever but go to the landlord and ask for a reduction of rent i remember the case of a most respectable farmer from the county of wexford who was brought into kilmainham one day he was a mr crosby i think a tenant on an estate in that county and he had a large establishment in addition to the farm he was a leaseholder one of the class you are now going to relieve after seven years waiting and he headed a deputation of his brother tenants to the landlord or to the agent i cannot say now which to ask for a reduction for rent the landlord or agent said to him i will go up to dublin castle to night and i will see mr forster he did not speak so courteously of mr forster he used another name which in respect for the memory of the man i shall not myself use i shall see mr forster he said i will have you in gaol in kilmainham before hours have gone by well sir he did go up to dublin castle and saw mr forster and mr crosby was in gaol in kilmainham before hours it will be the same way now even the printer devils employed in the office of united ireland were arrested under the act of for intimidation because they inked the types of that journal and the very newsboys of the streets were arrested by the police for intimidation for crying the paper about the streets so it will be now you will coerce the irish tenants and compel them to use your so called remedial legislation legislation which can only be carried out at a vast cost to the english taxpayer all guarantees of fair dealing will be gone and how can you expect that the irish tenants will not repudiate such a bargain when they get the chance i will now sir leave this question of remedial legislation and i will go to the coercion bill of the government and the case which the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant made upon its introduction and sir i have to complain that in the course which the government have taken they have entirely deprived the house of any real means of checking the information they have supplied they supplied the house with information solely on their own authority they have not given us the names or except in a very few cases any details that would enable us to check the bonâ fide character of this information now it is a very serious thing when you are attempting to steal away the liberties of a nation by such a case as that put forward by the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to depart from the precedent that has been sot by the previous government under similar circumstances at all other times we have had figures in abundance we have had statistics of crime that the government in question had based their eases upon those figures and upon those statistics but in this case the government have not based their case on any figures or on any statistics given to the house the right hon gentleman treated us to a series of anecdotes but he gave us nothing definite i remember in my young days the great pleasure i experienced when reading robinson crusoe i asked whether it was true or not i was informed that it was not absolutely true but i was comforted by the assurance that it was founded upon fact but we are unable to comfort ourselves even with this assurance in the case of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary the child guide to knowledge is nothing to the encyclopedia the right hon gentleman has unfolded for the edification of us irish he has told us that he has based his case upon a series of anecdotes for example he gave us the number of persons under police protection in ireland that is an important piece of collateral evidence i submit it is not one of the figures which should have been given as one of the leading grounds for the government case because it is a statement which is impossible for us to test or compare with those of previous years such figures as those are not given in the annual government returns the number of persons under police protection in the year for instance when the conservative government came into office abandoning coercion it would be extremely interesting for us to know in order that we might compare them with the figures given for the year we have not got this information nor can we get information of any kind relied on by the right hon gentleman in the parliamentary papers we are therefore without the usual means of testing either the truth or the value of the truth of those statements of the right hon gentleman which he has used as one of his leading crutches the right hon gentleman gave us the charges of some of the irish judges i say some for he only gave us four of the charges of the irish judges the charges of irish judges are not put into parliamentary blue books and consequently we are here again not in a position to compare the charges of those four irish judges with the charges delivered in and probably if we were in a position to make the comparison we would have found that mr justice law son mr justice johnson mr justice murphy and mr justice o'brien have been delivering exactly the same kind of charges they had used during the last eight of the nine years since the right hon gentleman said these were not political judges two of them certainly are judge o'brien and judge johnson are political judges i mean they are judges who owe their elevation to the bench in a great measure to the fact that one was successful in obtaining a seat in the house of commons and that the other was not successful for i had the pleasure of defeating mr justice o'brien myself at a contested election in ennis in so consequently both these judges are political judges they are notorious for the violence of their utterances and for the way in which they transgress all traditions of the judicial bench in going out of their way in denouncing what they called the inherent vice and iniquity of the irish people nobody but right hon gentlemen like the chief secretary could have attached the slightest sic importance to their utterances and nobody else would have thought of bringing them forward as a fair example of their class but although we cannot go back and compare the utterances of these judges with their utterances in past years and especially in when as i have already said the conservative government abandoned coercion i am entitled to ask why did not the government give us some of the charges of the other irish judges there are irish judges and out of these the government selected the four i have mentioned why did not they give us the charges of some of the other judges i have been at some pains to collect some of those charges during the recent assizes but i really do not like to detain the house in reading them for the four that the right hon gentleman has trotted out i shall be able to trot out or in a distinctly reverse sense to that of those four judges but i do not like to detain the house by going over these charges i will say this that i think the government have placed us in a most unfair position by going out of the beaten track in reference to this matter by basing their case on a few judges charges on the failures of juries to convict picked up here and there all over the country the foul refuse of scavengering sic which the right hon gentleman should have been ashamed to produce i have here the judges charges for mayo meath galway tipperary the city of limerick the county of sligo north tipperary waterford county king county tipperary county roscommon county and westmeath county i will read you one example which will show that the judges have spoken in the highest terms of the peace of the country of the absence of any serious crime and also of the considerable diminution in crime that has taken place since the last assizes let us take the north biding of tipperary as a fair example baron dowse said the cases reported to me by the county inspector number only eight and with the exception of those i have mentioned they do not show the prevalence of crime in this part of the county the contrast between these eight and the tried before the judge of this assize last year is on the whole very satisfactory so far as it goes it shows the crimes are very few tipperary was never in a better state baron dowse then goes on to administer a little lecture to the grand jury he says you may possibly like before you are discharged to pass like other grand juries a resolution about the desperate state of the country i have nothing to do with that and you may think that what i have said is all wrong what i have to deal with is cases of crime these are what the county inspector has to deal with and so far as the cases of crime are concerned the state of the country is satisfactory i state there has been a decrease of crime in all classes i can read similar extracts from the other judges for instance lord justice fitzgibbon in meath said the county showed its usual absence of anything like serious crime and that was the subject which judges of assize had directly to deal with baron dowse in waterford county said he was glad to inform the grand jury that on that occasion as on many previous occasions he could congratulate them on the peaceful state of the county in waterford city judge andrews said there are only two cases to go before you and these are of the ordinary character in the queen county judge johnson said the county inspector report showed that the county was in a satisfactory condition in sligo judge johnson and in roscommon judge murphy congratulated the grand juries on the peaceableness of those two counties in westmeath sir michael morris the chief justine said i am happy to inform you there is only one bill to go before you the grand jury then retired and found no bill i do not think it is necessary to go any further though i have five or sis other cases i have selected charges from different parts of the country and other charges of the judges tell the same tale and i ask sir was it fair for the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to treat us exclusively to the charges of four judges and ignore the charges of judges who charged in totally different directions and in so very different a tone the right hon gentleman the chief secretary also relied upon the number of offences committed in five large counties in ireland comprising as he said one third of ireland which is only true as to area the population being about one sixth or one seventh he had selected them as being the worst in ireland and he said there had been offences of all kinds committed last year recollect not agrarian offences against which this bill is directed but offences of all kinds is that an extravagant calendar of crime for the large counties of ireland comprising one third of the area and one seventh of the population of the country for the whole year just look at the calendar of crime in any of your own english counties during the period of one year well he says that out of these cases there was no clue discovered of the perpetrators in but who is responsible for that the explanation is that in ireland we have no detective police force or police worthy of the name the police force is kept up as a military force for the purpose of overawing opposition at evictions of irish tenants and it is notorious that no attempt worthy of the name is made to detect crime unless it is agrarian i will venture to say also that if you compare the statistics of crime in england where no clue is obtained and no person is made amenable you will find a large proportion of such cases also and yet you have an efficient police force and the sympathy of the people with them not alienated to a great extent as in ireland by the fact that so called law and justice has been used for centuries for the oppression of the people i believe it would be no exaggeration to say that of the offences committed in english towns there are fewer than half in which the offender is caught or any person made amenable to the jaw we all know the numbers of murdered people who are yearly picked up in the thames of whose deaths no trace can be found i say it is monstrous to take away the character of the people of ireland on such grounds as those then the right hon gentleman the chief secretary says there are instances in which persons injured declined to swear any information i should like to have compared with this the number of people who refused to swear informations in regard to cases in england in it is undoubtedly the case that a great many of these injuries occur in party faction in these faction fights it seems to be a point of honour with the person concerned not to give information to the police it consequently happens that persons who have got a blow on the head with a stick in a faction fight or who has received some ether injury in some drinking row coming home from a fair do frequently not volunteer to give information i regret that this should be so i regret that there should be any faction fights i regard them as a disgrace and a weakness to ireland but they are not nearly so numerous as they were and this bill is not directed against faction fights the number of cases in which juries have confused to convict has been also made much of the right hon gentleman has given us three or four instances in regard to this matter but it is a curious fact that he did not give one in any of the five counties which he held up to us as examples of all that is terrible in the state of ireland three or four cases in which juries refused to agree were given and two of them were in the county of tipperary a model county according to the testimony of baron dowse the government are so happy as to possess a careful informant in tipperary in the person of the notorious mr george bolton who is the crown solicitor there and i have no doubt he is the person who has given the right hon gentleman the information which he conveyed to the house as to these cases the other night what were these two cases one of them was that of a man named clarke whom the right hon gentleman wished the house to believe was acquitted of some charge because he was either a national leaguer or a local leader of the people whatever that may be according to the best of my information clarke was not a member of the national league at all but whether he was one does not alter the details of my case which shows that so far from there being any demoralization of the jury expressly proves that clarke who was a protestant managed to get upon the jury a friend of his named hayes a publican and a catholic this man hayes was the only member of the jury consisting of who refused to agree on a verdict of guilty against clarke now that is one example of the cases on which the right hon gentleman seeks to blacken the character of juries not only of tipperary but of all ireland eleven catholics were for a conviction and one catholic a personal friend of clarke's was for an acquittal it is very hard that we should be driven and obliged to investigate these cases in remote holes and corners of ireland and occupy the time of the house of commons afterwards in contradicting such ridiculous statements by producing such information as we can get colonel king harman kent isle of thanet how does the hon gentleman get these names of the proportion of the jurors mr parnell the hon and gallant gentleman and his friends are always very unwilling to give us any information but if the hon and gallant gentleman appeals to his friend mr george bolton he would be able to tell him that my information is absolutely correct at any rate i am in a position to guarantee the authenticity and certainty of my information and i will substantiate it before a select committee of the house of commons if the house will grant one now i come to the case of a man named hogan who is acquitted on a charge of rape the right hon gentleman says he was charged with a horrible outrage on a respectable girl and was found not guilty because he was a well known leaguer in the district now i have here a letter this letter i am going to read is from a barrister who was present in the court watching the trial the fact was the prisoner was charged with rape and the prosecutrix was an able bodied healthy young woman aged about or she swore that he raped her six separate times in one hour a very remarkable story the jury ought not and would not have convicted on the crown case alone but the prisoner was examined under mr stead act it was proved and not uncontradicted that he spent five hours about the fields and ditches with this girl that evening and he repeatedly had connection with her but with her entire consent the jury thereupon acquitted him this is one of the cases of the right hon gentleman on such information given by his friend mr george bolton the right hon gentleman regales the house of commons while the government is engaged in destroying the liberties of the people this man hogan was not a member of the national league now i turn to the third case and this was a case of a rich farmer who was charged according to the statement of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary with obtaining money by means of false documents the case said the right hon gentleman of the prosecutor a maltster was proved in the clearest possible manner the judge charged strongly for a conviction but the jury which consisted of farmers disagreed now the barrister whose letter i have previously quoted says of this ease this was a case which was proved in which perhaps a very intelligent jury familiar with accounts would have convicted but as a matter of fact it was a most complicated and difficult case the transactions nearly all of them took place in the witnesses examined were by no means clear but on the contrary were indistinct mainly owing to failure of memory but partly to the complex nature of the case the documentary evidence included a great number of cheques and the accuracy of various complicated book entries the wonder was not that the jury disagreed but that as the fact was were for a conviction at which the counsel for the prosecution was very much surprised the chief secretary for ireland mr a j balfour manchester e is that the same case of which the hon gentleman spoke just now mr parnell that is the same case the right hon gentleman observes that there is nothing contradictory in the two accounts but a great deal which is confirmatory i will now leave the right hon gentleman and his selected cases which he gave to the house in regard to jury packing he gave three or four cases altogether in which he gave the names i have traced three of them with the results i have stated now sir he relied also on the boycotting cases he told us of a large number of cases of boycotting in ireland amounting to here again no information is given in the parliamentary return and the same complaint that i made in regard to other branches of the right hon gentleman case applies to these statistics also we have no opportunity of comparing the number of such cases with the number in previous years especially in the house will see that it would have been of the utmost importance to us to have been enabled to compare the number of boycotting cases in when the government comes forward with this the most drastic coercion act that has ever been heard of since and that act was not used and the number of boycotting cases in when by the mouth of their chief secretary and of lord carnarvon the government announced they were going to abandon the old evil methods of coercion i do not believe if we had the information which we ought to have and which it was the duty of the right hon gentleman to produce we should find there was very much difference in the number of persons boycotted in and the number boycotted in but the right hon gentleman gives us some cases of boycotting and i must assume as in the case of jury packing the right hon gentleman has selected the most favourable examples from his point of view he could find he gave us the case of a butcher who was prosecuted and punished for intimidation the person intimidated being subsequently boycotted and his wife refused the services of a midwife it is very terrible that this poor woman should have been refused help in the hour of her need and i do not believe that any number of persons in ireland even in that district would have done such a thing or have taken any part in doing it but what does it prove the person who was charged with the boycotting offence was convicted therefore that is not a failure of the law this is an example given in support of a bill brought forward to prevent failures in the law with regard to cases of boycotting but the right hon gentleman places in the very forefront of his examples the case of a person who was convicted with the result of showing that the accused person was convicted in spite of the fact that he had the sympathy of the people of the locality enlisted on his side then the thurles case in august was another of the right hon gentleman examples just at the very time when lord carnarvon was going up and down ireland preaching peace and conciliation to the irish people and when lord salisbury was making his celebrated newport speech about the uselessness of the intimidation clauses of the crimes act then he gives us a third example a resolution adopted at a meeting of a national league branch in sligo that mr j harvey be adopted as the poor law candidate for this parish and that mr brett he asked to send in his resignation so as to save expenses what are the unseen applications of the new bill which are to prevent people in localities in ireland from passing a resolution asking candidates to withdraw from competition for the post of poor law guardian could any constitutional right be more harmless than that of passing such resolutions without a single intimidating or inflammatory speech or word then there was another case of intimidation which the right hon gentleman has culled this was a resolution passed by a local branch of the national league on the 25th march last year in which members were informed that they were expected to pay their subscriptions then due to the branch then the right hon gentleman gave us along sic list of cases of boycotting and these cases i would ask the house to notice he divided into classes he gave us no less than eight or nine distinct classes of boycotting and amongst them was the case of a man who as the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland would have them believe was boycotted because he refused to join the national league he was challenged on the spot to give a single case of pressure being brought to bear on anybody to join the national league throughout the whole of ireland but he could not do so if any such thing as this occurred in connection with the national league that branch guilty of conduct like that would be dissolved on the spot for the simple reason that no pressure of any kind is brought to bear on anyone to induce them to join the national league the right hon gentleman quoted that case and others in support of his argument but he did not give us a single instance actually of that class of offence he then made the further accusation against the national league that it had destroyed the value of the tenant right in irish land i always thought that the value of the tenant right in irish land after the tenant had paid his rent and provided for the wants of himself and his family had been entirely destroyed by the fall in prices produced by american competition if the irish farmer has a margin on the wrong side of his balance he can have no tenant right it ceases to exist and it does not require the all potent and mischievous body the national league or anything else to step in and destroy it i now come mr speaker to the provisions of the bill itself i will not go into the figures which were given with so much power and force and which i cannot pretend to imitate even at a modest distance by the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian mr w e gladstone and which proved that the state of ireland in regard to crime as compared with its state in previous years is one of enormous improvement and that whereas in the case of preceding coercion acts a case was made out showing that crime was on the ascendant in the present instance the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian shows that crime was going down nor shall i refer to the contention of the hon and learned gentleman the attorney general for england sir richard webster last night we wore taunted by the hon and learned gentleman with the fact that when a coercion bill was brought into this house in there was not as much agrarian crime in ireland as at the present time if the hon and learned gentleman had the knowledge on the subject which we cannot expect he should have of the irish question he would have known that the coercion bill of as compared with the present bill of her majesty government was as new milk it consisted only of two or throe sic very insignificant provisions one of which is now embodied in the law of the land namely the provision in regard to searching for arms and punishing the possession of arms now let me say a few words with regard to the provisions of the bill which is to be laid before us by the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland we have first of all clauses taken as the right hon gentleman told us from the scotch act relating to secret inquiry and examination now sir these clauses are harmless enough if society is in a normal condition then they are not liable to be abused the working of these clauses in the act of and subsequent years showed that they were liable to abuse and that they were not effective except in a few cases such as murder the only instances in which these clauses in their practical working were effective was in the case of the invincibles i do not believe the invincible conspiracy would have been broken by you were it not for the denunciation which mr michael davitt my hon friend the member for east mayo mr j dillon and myself issued on the morning that we heard of the terrible crime in the phœnix park i believe it was that denunciation that shook that conspiracy and made it possible for the officers of the law in ireland to make their secret inquiries to stamp out the conspiracy and to convict the prisoners connected with it and finally to break it up but what was our experience of these secret inquiry clauses in the act of why that they were used to ascertain the case of the prisoner before he came to trial so that the crown lawyers might be informed of all the particulars as well as the prisoner knew them himself the witnesses for the defence in the case of the invincible trials were actually summoned after the proceedings had commenced and after it was known that these people were to be witnesses they were summoned before the secret tribunal in dublin castle and examined as to their knowledge of the matter and as to the evidence they were going to give in the trials before the court i say mr speaker that is striking below the belt and are methods which should not be adopted even in dealing with murderers before trial i now go a step farther the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland says trial by jury is to be abolished altogether and that instead of judges we are to have two stipendiary magistrates or an english judge there is power given to change the venue and the right hon gentleman appears to have given both his english jury and his change of venue because he said he could not depend on the jury system at all and secondly because it was necessary to remove the trial of certain cases to the old bailey we are as i have said to have two stipendiary magistrates what are their powers to be they are to be entitled to try cases of criminal conspiracy boycotting whiteboy offences assaulting the officers of the law taking forcible possession of premises and inciting to the above offences the calendar of offences in the act of is enormously increased whiteboy offences are not known to your statute law they are offences which are punishable by barbarous punishments which are most drastic in their character and these offences are to be tried by these men then you make a provision for the trial of cases of criminal conspiracy my hon friend the member for east mayo would have been tried under that clause and would have been sent to a plank bed in an irish prison for six months with hard labour he would have been given ounces of bread and water a day and perhaps a little porridge once a week by way of a change this is the way you are going to treat your political prisoners and to bring peace and contentment to ireland the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland says we do not propose to interfere with the liberty of the press oh no no not directly everything is to be done indirectly in this bill the right hon gentleman said we entertain the hope that by giving magistrates summary jurisdiction entitling them to punish persons inciting to those offences we may be able to prevent the press from being sharers in these crimes as i stated a while ago anent the printer devil the newsboys the men who attend to the engine would not be safe nay more they would be certain to be attacked under this law inciting to intimidation was one of these offences provided for in mr forster act and under the special provision the whole staff of united ireland were arrested it was not merely the journalist who sits in his parlour and writes the article who was attacked but the unfortunate printer of the paper and the men who are trying to earn their bread by the work of their hands i leave the question of the change of venue and the change of jury with the remark that in all the provisions of the act of there was none that excited so much distrust in the minds of public men of the impartiality of english justice in ireland or lent more power to the belief that in consequence of the operation of these clauses prisoners had been sent to the gallows and penal servitude who were really innocent men and several innocent persons are still suffering long sentences of penal servitude on account of those provisions the right hon gentleman told us he could not trust any jury not even the belfast jury that refused to convict an orangeman who was put upon his trial for murdering a soldier with regard to the jury system the powers which the right hon gentleman seeks to obtain from this house are powers to enable him to put into the jury box any man that mr george bolton desires knowing as he will know or as his underlings will know because he will not do the dirty work himself men whose political complexion will be well known beforehand and who can be trusted they are the powers to enable the right hon gentleman and his friends to know beforehand what the jury will do and mr speaker if i were in a position to choose and i hope i may not be called upon to make a selection i should prefer to such a tribunal the tender mercies of an old bailey jury the lord lieutenant has also power to make it an offence against the act to have anything to do with an association formed for the commission of crime carrying on operation for or by the operation of crime for inciting to commit crime for promoting and inciting to acts of violence and intimidation for interfering with the administration of the law or disturbing the maintenance of law and order he was certainly a very ingenious lawyer who drew that it is thoroughly comprehensive and i defy anyone politician or anyone else to lift a finger or to say a word of which the government disapprove if they choose to put him on trial without standing a pretty good chance of conviction no matter how innocent the man may be sir i am sorry to believe that in this bill the reign of judicial murder in ireland will be commenced the hopes of a better time which for a few short weeks dawned on the minds of the irish people have disappeared the suborning of witnesses will begin and so will the wholesale perjury of your crown officials in ireland what is it you are going to do you will try the tenants and their advocates by packed juries of their landlords and their creatures the tenants and their advocates for the offence of showing that a reduction of rent is necessary will be hurried before a landlord jury who will decide in their own cause these partizan juries will not even exhibit the ordinary tendency of an english jury they will hasten to convict their minds will be irritated by the recollection of their own losses arising on the one hand out of remedial legislation sanctioned by this house and on the other by the action of general buller and my hon friend the member for east mayo they will be burning in the loss to their pockets and the loss to their prestige it is hopeless to expect a fair trial from such men and by such a system it is inevitable that you will send to the scaffold and the convict cell many innocent persons known to be innocent by their neighbours in some cases known to be innocent by the authorities the formation of secret societies will be encouraged and fomented beyond a doubt because the people will recognize that for their own safety it is impossible to remain outside either the walls of dublin castle on the one hand or the ranks of a secret and criminal organization on the other this measure sends the popular leaders who advise the tenant to ask for a reduction of his rent as well as the tenant who asks for that reduction to the tender mercies of one of these stipendiary magistrates magistrates who are not magistrates according to the ordinary acceptation of the term as you know they are magistrates who are inexperienced in law without legal education many of them retired officers of the army who have failed in other walks of life and who as a little bit of patronage get dropped into a snug berth of this kind there men will not consider whether the law allows them to do this although this bill allows them to do anything they will only consider what their masters the government of the day would like them to do and they will deem opposition to the government policy an offence against this act the journalist who criticizes the action of the government or protests against landlord tyranny and oppression will meet with the same fate in fact there is no loophole of escape for any political movement in ireland if this bill passes it would be preposterous folly for any politician to attempt to cope with the powers which it gives to the government they will have to leave the field to others i hope i sincerely hope that there may not be others to take that field i would have done much if i had been able to do so last autumn to have alleviated the stringency of the position in ireland to have counselled moderation amongst the irish tenants to have advised them to boar any suffering to have submitted to any rack renting any eviction any extermination rather than give the government the miserable rags and shreds of excuse which they have for this bill i was confident from the moment that the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian directed his gigantic talent to the redress of irish grievances in the only way in which they ever can be redressed and that is by allowing the irish people to redress them for themselves that it was only a question of time and of a very short time when the main principles of this bill would be carried into effect and would bring about a lasting reconciliation and peace between the two nations i believe so still i would still counsel patience i would still urge the irish people to submit to any oppression to any injustice rather than to retaliate i would ask them to remember the weighty words of the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian the other evening when he told them that he and the liberal party had been enabled to come thus far with us to fight by our side against this coercion because the irish people had remained as a whole within the limits of legality i would ask them to remember that they ought not to do anything to drive the right hon gentleman away from our side or to increase his difficulties or place him in any false position with his own countrymen our battle is won in ireland there may be some suffering to endure there may be some tyranny perhaps much tyranny yet inflicted upon us petty tyrants are always the most merciless but it will be as nothing compared with what our people have gone through in the past a little patience a few years of waiting and these clouds will be cleared away the eternity that is written on this bill will disappear before the brighter time when the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian will be able once more to appeal to the common sense and the sense of justice of the people of england the people of britain and when he will receive those full powers which will enable him to do justice to our country yes i would urge these considerations upon our people and from my place in this house i urge them ireland will have no place for speaking in after this bill passes the party who have got to gain by violence by going beyond the law in ireland are the present government this is why they have brought forward this bill to strengthen their own miserable position and remain in office for a few months longer let our people not fall into these toils that have been set for them i greatly fear for the result but sir i will not cease to tell the people of ireland that the situation is entirely different for them from what it was five or six years ago and that victory for them is certain and secure i believe that our people as a whole will bear in patience those sufferings and tribulations which are undoubtedly before them for the present and that the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian will find that his hand has not been sullied in the great and glorious work which he has undertaken i beg to move the amendment which stands in my name mr paenell sic i did not say i altogether objected to the plan of the government as a matter of fact i approved of it as regarded the leaseholders mr a j balfour i was not then speaking of the leaseholders mr parnell if we are to judge by the words used by lord cadogan as to leaseholders the government propose to take the words from my bill of last session mr parnell i did not say that at all mr parnell it was two cases i read i think three letters and they had reference to two cases mr parnell cork i am afraid sir that the right hon gentleman who has just spoken has not paid me a very great compliment in saying that only a few passages in the first part of my speech this evening were devoted to the subject on which we received information for the first time last night i certainly intended that the whole of my speech should hang upon and be connected with that information and it was my desire in the preparation of my speech to carry out that intention and i think i did so however be that as it may i think the right hon gentleman will admit that he takes upon himself very considerable responsibility in adopting the unreasonable course which he now proposes to adopt of refusing to concede another night for the discussion of an amendment of the character of that which is before the house i may remind the right hon gentleman of the appeal which has been made by the right hon member for mid lothian with his great experience of the traditions of this house many of my hon friends who are inclined to speak in this preliminary debate have so far waived their right of speaking in favour of the numerous english and scotch members who have desired to speak on one side of the house or the other it is right that the voice of great britain should be heard and heard effectually and oven sic if none of us should be permitted to speak by the exigencies of the limits which the right hon gentleman appears to have felt it his duty to place upon the debate we should not have grudged that surrender of our rights since it enabled the noble demonstration to be given which has been afforded by so many members for great britain during the last few days but sir the fact remains that such members as the hon member for west belfast mr sexton one of the nationalist ulster members and my hon friend who has moved the adjournment of the debate mr t p o'connor have not been permitted to speak even upon the motion for taking all the time of the house for this bill much less upon the motion for the introduction of the bill or the amendment we are now discussing the right hon gentleman cannot reconcile that state of affairs coming upon a coercion bill a bill in which our liberties are so deeply involved as being consistent with the declarations repeatedly made in the discussion of the closure rule the right hon gentleman cannot say it is fair or in accordance with fair play that so few irish members should be heard as have been heard oven upon this preliminary motion he cannot say that any time has been wasted by any of the irish members or by any of the english members he must know full well by this time that the introduction of this coercion bill has stirred this house to its depths and will stir this country to its depths he must know that if he smothers debate to night it will burst out some other night on some other stage if he chokes off the discussion of this stage of the bill by an unfair application of the rule of procedure which he has obtained under distinct and oft repeated pledges that it should be used only to stop irrelevant and undue discussion and the flame is smothered to night it will break out again shortly it is impossible in these days and with the advantages we live under to ultimately choke down a case and stop discussion in this house i think the right hon gentleman will see that the demand we make is not an unreasonable one he cannot say speaking in reference to the irish members that they have occupied an undue portion of the time of the house the irish members have not sustained their due share of this discussion the time within which such members as the hon member for west belfast can speak as the right hon gentleman knows is very limited being confined to periods of two or three hours at the beginning and at the close of the evening it is not fair to expect such members to speak during the dinner hour oh oh i think even young tory members will admit that it would not be reasonable to expect the hon member for west belfast to speak on a coercion bill directed against ireland during the dinner hour the request we make is not an unreasonable one it is an eminently reasonable one i trust the right hon gentleman will show his ideas of fair play and his willingness to keep his word to us by acceding to the motion which my hon friend has made\n",

      "mr parnell cork after the fenian rising mr parnell cork and i stated that it was absolutely false i say so still mr parnell will the noble marquess give the reasons he has for supposing that those gentlemen whose names he has mentioned are leaders of the fenian organization in america for i do not know them to be such and i do not believe that they are such mr parnell the forger mr parnell i said there were also disputes arising out of drunkenness ill returning home from fairs that applies to the figures which the right hon gentleman quoted as a matter of fact there were plenty of faction fights during the period referred to by the right hon gentleman mr parnell whose case is it mr parnell will the right hon gentleman do me the justice to remember that in this case of clark's my informant admitted that there should have been a conviction and pointed out that it was owing to the difficult nature of the case that some of the juries failed to agree in the statement that the right hon gentleman has given there is no contradiction of the statement of my informant that only two jurymen dissented from the verdict of guilty mr parnell mr ryan gives no opinion of his own about the division of the jury he says he was informed that the jury were divided mr parnell the only inconsistency of the two versions i gave is that one informant stated that two jurors held out and the other said that only one had done so mr parnell the only inconsistency of the two versions i gave is that one informant stated that two jurors held out and the other said that only one had done so mr parnell so it was that branch was immediately dissolved an hon member sold again mr parnell cork the right hon gentleman mr a j balfour refrained from answering the speech which i delivered on the first reading of this bill and the government refused to allow the adjournment of the debate in order that some other member of the government should have an opportunity of answering it the next day and now upon the second reading of this bill he goes back to the speech and he attempts an answer to it at a time of the night when he knows perfectly well that no reply can be made to him and with characteristic fairness an unfairness which i suppose we may expect to be continued in the future he has refused to me the or minutes that i should have craved to refer to a villainous and barefaced forgery which appeared in the times of this morning obviously for the purpose of influencing the division and for no other purpose i got up when the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian mr w e gladstone sat down i had not intended to have made a speech at all upon the second reading stage of this bill i should not have said more than a very few words in reference to this forgery but i think i was entitled to have had from the right hon gentleman an opportunity of exposing this deliberate attempt to blacken my character at some time when there would have been some chance of what i stated reaching the outside world i say there is no such chance now i cannot suppose the right hon gentleman in refusing me the minutes which i crave had not in his eye the design of practically preventing my denial of this unblushing calumny having that effect upon public opinion which it would otherwise have had if it had been spoken at a reasonable hour of the night it appears that in addition to the passage of this coercion act the dice are to be loaded that your great organs of public opinion in this country are to be permitted to pay miserable creatures for the purpose of producing these calumnies who will be safe in such circumstances and under such conditions i do not envy the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland this first commencement of suppression of defence this first commencement of calumny and of forgery which has been made by his supporters we have heard of the misdeeds of mr ford the editor of the irish world but mr ford never did anything half so bad as this mr parnell i was asked officially at an early hour in the evening whether i would speak after the right hon member for mid lothian and i replied that i would and that i only intended to say a few words in reference to this calumny i think i ought to have been given the opportunity which i desired now sir when i first heard of this precious concoction i heard of it before i saw it because i do not take in or even read the times usually when i heard that a letter of this description bearing my signature had been published in the times i supposed that some autograph of mine had fallen into the hands of some person for whom it had not been intended and that it had been made use of in this way i supposed that some bank sheet containing my signature such as many members who are asked for their signature frequently send i supposed that such a blank sheet had fallen into hands for which it had not been intended and that it had been misused in this fashion or that something of that kind had happened but when i saw what purported to be my signature i saw plainly that it was an audacious and unblushing fabrication why sir many members of this house have seen my signature and if they will compare it with what purports to be my signature in the times of this morning they will see that there are only two letters in the whole name which bear any resemblance to letters in my own signature as i write it i cannot understand how the conductors of a responsible and what used to be a respectable journal could have been so hoodwinked so hoaxed so bamboozled and that is the most charitable interpretation which i can place on it as to publish such a production as that as my signature my writing its whole character is entirely different i unfortunately write a very cramped hand my letters huddle into each other and i write with very great difficulty and slowness it is in fact a labour and a toil to me to write anything at all but the signature in question is written by a ready penman who has evidently covered as many leagues of letter paper in his life as i have yards of course this is not the time as i have said to enter into full details and minutiæ as to comparisons of handwriting but if the house could see my signature and the forged fabricated signature they would see that except as regards two letters the whole signature bears no resemblance to mine the same remark applies to the letter the letter does not purport to be in my handwriting we are not informed who has written it it is not alleged even that it was written by anyone who was ever associated with me the name of this anonymous letter writer is not mentioned i do not know who he can be the writing is strange to me i think i should insult myself if i said i think however that i perhaps ought to say it in order that my denial may be full and complete that i certainly never heard of the letter i never directed such a letter to be written i never saw such a letter before i saw it in the times this morning the subject matter of the letter is preposterous on the surface the phraseology of it is absurd as absurd as any phraseology that could be attributed to me could possibly be in every part of it it bears absolute and irrefutable evidence of want of genuineness and want of authenticity politics are come to a pretty pass in this country when a leader of a party of members has to stand up at ten minutes past one in the house of commons in order to defend himself from an anonymous fabrication such as that which is contained in the times of this morning i have always held with regard to the late mr forster that his treatment of his political prisoners was a humane treatment and a fair treatment and i think for that reason alone if for no other he should have been shielded from such an attempt as was made on his life by the invincible association i never had the slightest notion in the world that the life of the late mr forster was in danger or that any conspiracy was on foot against him or any other official in ireland or elsewhere i had no more notion than an unborn child that there was such a conspiracy as that of the invincibles in existence and no one was more surprised more thunderstruck and more astonished than i was when that bolt from the blue fell upon us in the phoenix park murders i knew not in what direction to look for this calamity it is no exaggeration to say that if i had been in the park that day i would gladly have stood between lord frederick cavendish and the daggers of the assassins and for the matter of that between their daggers and mr burke too now sir i leave this subject i have suffered more than any other man from that terrible deed in the phoenix park and the irish nation has suffered more than any other nation through it i go for a moment to the noble marquess the member for rossendale the marquess of hartington the noble marquess made a rather curious complaint of me he said that having denied point blank a charge that had been made by him against me and the national league during the general election last year he was rather surprised that i did not again refer to the matter in the house of commons well i was rather surprised that the noble marquess did not refer to it in the house of commons because the noble marquess made a charge which he advanced without a particle of proof he advanced that charge again to night without a particle of proof and i deny that charge as i denied it before in point blank terms i said it was absolutely untrue to say that the irish national league or the parliamentary party had over had any communication whatever direct or indirect with a fenian organization in america or this country i further said that i did not know who the leaders of the fenian organization in this country or america were i say that still but the noble marquess says he knows who they are at least he tells us that mr alexander sullivan i believe that was the name mentioned was president of the clan na gael or fenian organization when i asked him how he obtained his knowledge he said that he obtained it from information he received as a member of her majesty government that may be but i am not in possession of the information with regard to the clan na gael which is possessed by the members of the present or the late government the clan na gael is a secret organization it is an oath bound organization it gives no information with regard to its members to persons who are not members i presume that the government if they obtained this information with regard to alexander sullivan obtained it through their secret agents in america through means which are not open to me in any capacity as a private person or a public politician it is no answer to me to say that because the noble marquess a member of the late government with all the information obtainable by the wealth and resources of that government at his disposal believes alexander sullivan was a member and the leader of the clan na gael or any secret organization in america i have never had any dealings with him or anyone else either in ireland or america in respect to the doings or proceedings of any secret society whatsoever all my goings on and sayings and doings in irish public life have been open and above board and they have stood the test of the searching investigation of the three years administration of the crimes act by lord spencer who has left it on record that neither any of my colleagues nor myself were in any way connected with the commission of or approving of the commission of any crime here are lord spencer words spoken at newcastle on 21st of april foremost among the many objections are these it is said that you are going to hand over the government of ireland to men who have encouraged nay some i have hoard say even have directed outrage and crime in ireland that is a very grave accusation now i have been in a position in my official capacity to see and know nearly all the evidence that has been given in ireland in regard to the murders and conspiracies to murder that took place in and and i can say without doubt or hesitation that i have neither heard nor seen any evidence of complicity with those crimes against any of the irish representatives it is right that i should clearly and distinctly express my condemnation of many of the methods by which they carried on their agitation they often used language and arguments that were as unjustifiable as they were unfounded they sometimes perhaps from financial grounds were silent when words would have been golden when words might have had a great influence on the state of the country they might even have employed men for their own legitimate purposes who had been employed in illegal acts by others this i must say but on the other hand i believe those men to have an affection for and a real interest in the welfare of their country their ability has been shown and acknowledged in the house of commons by all parties i believe that with full responsibility upon them they will know that the only true way of obtaining the happiness and contentment of ireland is for the government to maintain law and order and defend the rights and privileges of every class and of every man in the country i cordially re echo those words i believe that that expresses the only real way of maintaining law and order in any country that you must obtain from the majority of the people of the country sympathy towards the law without which the maintenance of the law is impossible that you must show the majority of the community that the law is not only made but that it is also administered for their benefit and fairly and justly to all classes in this way and in this way only can you ever obtain respect and sympathy for law and order in ireland or anywhere else the present bill may put down crime or it may increase crime if it puts it down it will not put it down by instilling in the minds of the people a sympathy for law and order crime will die out only as the effect of sullen submission you will be no farther after you have been administering your crimes act in the direction of the real maintenance of law and order than you were at the beginning nay not nearly so far you are crushing by this iron coercion bill those beneficial symptoms in ireland which a government of wise statesmen and wise administrators would cherish and foster you are preventing that budding of friendship between the two countries which this generation would never have witnessed is ireland had it not been for the great exertions of the right hon member for mid lothian who could have predicted who would have ventured to predict that the heat the passion the political antipathies engendered by the working of the protection act of and the crimes act of would have all disappeared in three or four short months and that you would have had the english and the irish people regarding each other as they did during that happy that blessed interval and all this to be put an end to by the mad the fatuous conduct of the present government you are going to plunge everything back into the seething cauldron of disaffection you cannot see what the results of all this may be we can only point to the experience of what has happened in past times we anticipate nothing beneficial from this bill either to your country or to ours and we should not be honest men if we did not warn you with all the little force at our command of the terrible dangers that may be before you i trust that before this bill goes into committee or at all events before it leaves committee the great english people will make their voices heard and impress upon their representatives that they must not go on any further with this coercive legislation if this house and its majority have not sense enough to see this the great heart of this country will see it for i believe it is a great and generous heart that can sympathize even when a question is concerned in reference to which there have been so many political antipathies i am convinced by what i have seen of the great meetings which have been held over the length and breadth of england and scotland that the heart of your nation has been reached that it has been touched and though our opponents may be in a majority to day that the real force of public opinion is not at their back a bill which is supported by men many of whom are looking over their shoulders and behind them like the soldiers of an army which a panic is beginning to reach to see which is their readiest mode of retreat is not likely to get through the difficult times before it emerges from committee the result will be modifications of the provisions of the most drastic of the coercion acts ever introduced against ireland since do not talk to me of comparing the suspension of the habeas corpus act with the present bill we have suffered from both we have suffered from some of the provisions of the present bill as well as from the habeas corpus suspension act and we are able to compare the one with the other and i tell you that the provisions of the habeas corpus suspension act were as child play in contrast with the provisions of this bill the suspension of the habeas corpus act empowered you to arrest and detain in prison those whom you suspected but it guaranteed them humane treatment which did much to soften the asperities that otherwise would have been bred between the two nations by that act your prisoners under the habeas corpus act were not starved and tortured as they will be under this your political prisoners were not put upon a plank bed and fed on ounces of bread and water per day and compelled to pick oakum and perform hard labour as they will be under this bill the bill will be a means by which you will be enabled to subject your political prisoners to treatment in your gaols which you reserve in england for the worst of criminals and it is idle to talk about comparison between the suspension of the habeas corpus act under which your prisoners were humanely and properly treated although imprisonment is hard to boar under the best circumstances but in the position in which this bill will place them your political prisoners will be deliberately starved with hunger and clammed with cold in your gaols i trust in god sir that this nation and this house may be saved from the degradation and the peril that the mistake of passing this bill puts them in\n",

      "mr parnell cork i congratulate the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the exchequer mr goschen upon the determination which he has announced to night of the government to which he belongs that they intend to stand by the system of purchase and the abolition of dual ownership of the land in ireland and to resist any amendments to this bill that would seem to impede the adoption of a system of purchase as the ultimate settlement of the irish land question i cordially agree with him in that but i think the right hon gentleman is rather looking to the price at which this purchase shall take place and to the swelling of that price and the maintenance of that price at a fictitious height and value rather than to the impediments which the amendments we seek to introduce into this bill would throw in the way of dual ownership by all means do not set up any artificial barrier against a large scheme of land purchase but when the right hon gentleman devotes his great ability and financial experience to this attempt to bolster up the inflated rents on irish estates under the present system he is doing all he can to prevent any system of purchase from being adopted or if adopted to doom it to a near and speedy failure the right hon gentleman tells us that he desires to abolish eviction and so do we but the way in which the right hon gentleman proposes to abolish eviction is by calling it by another name under the system of the right hon gentleman proposed in clause evictions will take place just as they take place now but none of them will be recorded in your blue books undoubtedly it presented itself to the candid mind of the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the exchequer in looking over the long record of evictions in the returns presented to the house that it would be a most desirable thing to abolish this record evictions of caretakers are not called evictions in ireland they are not carried out by the sheriff and they are not given in any return to parliament the right hon gentleman will not get rid of a single eviction evictions will take place just as hitherto the only thing he will do will be to get rid of the record presented to parliament what happens now is that the tenant after the actual eviction has a six months period of redemption within that period he can redeem his holding and save his title from being broken by the payment of rent and costs either in full or in part if the landlord agrees to take less than the full sum but under the system which the right hon gentleman lauds when he tells us that a written notice will suffice the title of the tenant will practically be broken without chance of redemption by the written notice and by eviction which will follow it all the same it will be possible for the landlord to break the title which the land act of conferred upon the irish tenant by the use of this written notice with which the right hon gentleman is so much in love followed of course by the summary process of dispossession on a magistrate order it is not because we think that this system of written notice will get rid of the scenes that have shocked public opinion in this country that we object to the 4th clause but it is because we know that this system will not get rid of evictions and will not do away with the scenes either the scones will take place all the same the dispossession will have to come all the same evictions under another form will come all the same and you will find that these evictions will come home to your consciences and the consciences of our constituents just as they do now the right hon gentleman will find that he has been baffled in the amiable purpose which has governed the minds of the authors of clause this is a very good example of the way in which a minister of the crown thinks that he is entitled to mislead the house of commons the right hon gentleman actually attempts to prove in this house that by substituting a written notice and postponing the process of eviction for six months he will get rid of evictions altogether now i come to the question of the leaseholders i fear that after the declaration just made from the ministerial bench the hon member for south tyrone mr t w russell will find that his confidence in her majesty government has been somewhat misplaced the hon member sought to deprive me of any credit which may attach to the leaseholder clause in the relief bill i introduced last year by interrupting the right hon gentleman the member for derby sir william harcourt with the announcement that the clause would not have admitted the leaseholders of ireland and that therefore he refused his support to the bill mr t w russell tyrone s would not have admitted the whole of the leaseholders mr parnell the hon member did not say that that may have been and undoubtedly was his meaning but he did not say it however i accept his correction and i say that the clause in my bill which he refused to support because it would not have admitted the whole body of leaseholders would have done far more than the clause of the government the bill containing which he now supports the clause in the relief bill was the same as the clause of the government minus some of the important restrictions in the latter and consequently it was a better clause than the clause of the government and i ask the hon member for south tyrone how he can consistently defend himself for refusing to support a bill containing a better leaseholder clause than that in this measure mr t w russell if that clause had stood by itself in the bill of last year i should certainly have supported it but the bill contained a fatal clause which i was not prepared to support inasmuch as i was not prepared to support clause and as i thought clause defective i voted against the hon member bill and i should do so again mr parnell then i am afraid i must class the hon member in the category of unrepentant sinners the hon member having sold himself to his party in connection with the crimes bill and having agreed to vote with that party and to be bound by the decision of the majority of that party mr t w russell i never gave such a pledge mr parnell the hon member now finds himself in the position of being dragged at the tail of the party because they refuse to support him at least we understand the right hon gentleman the leader of the party does and we believe that the leader will carry the majority with him notwithstanding the puny efforts of the hon member for south tyrone the hon gentleman finds himself left in the lurch i appreciate at their true value the exertions of the right hon member for west birmingham mr joseph chamberlain i look upon that gentleman as a unit and nothing more in what is called the liberal unionist party i look upon him as possessing as little influence in the party and in the country as any other member of the party and certainly as possessing a great deal less influence than some members of the party i hope that the hon member for south tyrone when he revisits his constituents will provide himself with some better excuse for his conduct and perfidy than any which he has given to the house now i come to the question of the revision of the judicial leases which appears to be the question that will excite the greatest difference of opinion when the bill reaches committee sir the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the exchequer has used the most extraordinary argument he has told us that any attempt to interfere with judicial rents will discourage purchase why will it discourage purchase it will not discourage purchase as the right hon gentleman would have us believe because it will unsettle the prospect of variable rents it will settle the mind of the tenant because the tenant who is desirous of converting his variable rent into a fixed and terminable rent will have the inducement of being able to diminish the rent at which he starts it may however interfere in the mind of the right hon gentleman with the prospect of purchase because he thinks that he has thus got the tenant in a cleft stick and that he and the irish landlords are in the position of being able to say to the unfortunate rack rented tenants purchase or else go out and that is the keynote of all the proceedings of the government in reference to this question they wish to keep up the prices in order to force the tenant to purchase i believe this is a very mistaken policy from their own point of view for i am convinced the tenants will not purchase on the basis of the present prices for if they did the result would be disastrous both to them and to the english taxpayer i do not believe the common sense of the english people would permit such a job as that which the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the exchequer and his colleagues in the government are seeking to perpetuate in this attempt to bolster up the judicial rents as the basis of purchase and to send the tenant forward upon his new career with a small stone round his neck mr goschen i am sure the hon gentleman does not wish to misrepresent me i did not say that the judicial rents would be the basis of purchase and the right hon gentleman the chief secretary said that the purchase would not be based on any rent at all mr parnell well sir i am rather at a loss to know whether the right hon gentleman intends to join the no rent standard and to abolish rents altogether before he brings forward his purchase bill in that event undoubtedly there would be some people i will not say in ireland but over in new york who would cordially agree with him mr patrick ford for instance but i do not see on what lines the proposed system is to be based except upon rents unless it is upon no rents at all surely if you are going to buy property you estimate it by its yearly value by what it produces yearly and how is the right hon gentleman going to estimate the yearly value of irish farms unless he first ascertains what the fair rents of those farms are going to be it strikes me as being the only common sense way in which this operation can be gone about namely to ascertain a fair rent and then proceed to fix the number of years purchase if it is otherwise you and the other persons concerned will have no standard of value whatever upon which to go you will be in a perpetual state of uncertainty first of all as to how many years purchase should be given and secondly as to the principle of fair rents on which the number of years purchase should be estimated but i have another criticism of a more valid character to offer against the plan of the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the exchequer he proposes that these rents should remain as they are lest their reduction should interfere with the ultimate solution of the question by purchase that means that the tenant is to be left without any protection except that afforded by months interregnum constituted by the bankruptcy clauses which by the bye have now been given up by the government it means that the tenants are to be left without any protection except that afforded by the illusory 22nd clause until this system of purchase which is to be based upon some other plan of estimated value than what the rent may be is brought into effect the right hon gentleman is a financial authority of great experience but has he ever calculated the number of years it will take to investigate the titles and carry out a scheme of purchase upon any proportion of the land of ireland i have heard such an estimate made by good authorities that the period required has been put at from to years i do not see how you can possibly hope to complete the scheme of purchase in the minds of the government to abolish the system of dual ownership in ireland in a lesser period than eight or ten years during those years are the irish tenants to be left at the mercy of these rack rents for that is what is proposed by the government the government say we will not interfere with the act of but we will abolish dual ownership with the view of protecting the tenants from unjust and unfair payment i maintain that long before the system of dual ownership could be abolished by means of your system of purchase it will have abolished itself by the extermination of all the tenants of ireland the best authorities in the country have agreed that it is impossible for the tenants to pay the present rents why then in the name of common sense cannot the so called unionist party set to work to solve this problem and give protection to the tenants from unjust rents we have been blamed for being desirous of keeping this land question open some people say we want to keep it open in order to increase the strength of the national movement in order that the sores of ireland may be exhibited like those of lazarus for the compassion of the world others say that we want to close the question in order to get rid of the landlords and so abolish british rule in ireland in my judgment both sot sic of critics are wrong i certainly do not wish to keep this land question alive for the purpose of attracting attention to the grievances of ireland i believe that whether you settle the land question radically as proposed by us or whether you leave it open it will make no appreciable difference to the strength of the national movement if however you leave it unsettled you will have a continuation of those scenes which occurred lately you will have the disaffection of the people excited as it is against your rule and you will have the indignation of the nations of the world against your rule you will also have to answer to your consciences laughter perhaps they are not sufficiently tender for them to trouble you but at all events you will have your constituents finding fault with your proceedings in the government of ireland as they have done at some recent elections and you will continue to exhibit yourselves and your government as permanent monuments or monuments more or less permanent of stupidity and ineptitude i could not have believed it possible that the government would be so foolish and stupid and so regardless of their election pledges and every principle upon which they took their stand when they were making their appeal to the country at the last election as to deal with the irish land question as they have dealt with it since they came into office your whole platform was that you were strong enough and willing enough to do justice to ireland how have you dealt with this question in the first place you introduced the bill into the house of lords kept it there for weeks while you were chopping and changing it and now when it has come down to this house instead of announcing that you will meet the wishes of the country and bow to the inevitable you shift and shuffle and bring forward futile and insignificant excuses now the right hon gentleman has misrepresented the report of the cowper commission the cowper commission recommended that there should be a revision of rents every five years not from as represented by the right hon gentleman but judicial rent in each case was fixed the result of that would be that tenants would have gone into court to get their rents revised and the revision would have taken place without any of the difficulty or delay suggested by the right hon gentleman because as he admitted it would be a revision conducted on the basis of the difference in prices between the time at which the rents were fixed and now this provision would be a mere actuarial calculation necessitating no visiting of the farms or any of the proceedings which characterized the fixing of judicial rents the revision in respect of these or tenancies could be disposed of most rapidly it would not occupy more than a few months indeed there would have been none of the delay or difficulty anticipated by the right hon gentleman it may be necessary for us when the bill reaches committee to show you some way in which the difficulty can be met i hope the government will be in a better frame of mind by that time than they are in now and that they will reciprocate the way in which we have met them in regard to this matter by coming forward half way as we have come forward more than half way to meet them in the settlement of this great question now sir a revision of some kind of the judicial rents is absolutely necessary and it will be impossible for the government to go to the country or to go over to ireland and administer the coercion act in face of the fact that they leave the grievances of the judicial tenants unredressed they will be constituting a fresh inequality whereas the act of left the grievances of the leaseholders unredressed and whereas every year experience of the working of that act showed how more and more necessary it was that the leaseholders should be included in the act until at last the government have admitted that they ought to be included the working of this new bill will show every year how necessary it is that the judicial tenants should be admitted to the same privileges as the leaseholders that they should be allowed to apply to the court to have fair rents fixed at a time when a great fall in prices has taken place a fall which unhappily as far as all human judgment can foresee is bound to continue for many years to come sir i have dealt with the different points of the bill and i come now to consider the attitude that ought to be adopted by the opposition at this stage of the measure the government have dropped the whole of the bankruptcy clauses which constitute one half of the bill as it stands at present possibly by the time we reach the committee stage they may make up their minds to drop another quarter of the bill and substitute for that quarter a couple of pages of common sense and of justice at least i think it will be wise for us to give them the opportunity of doing so i think it will be wise for us in view of the progress that is being made upon this question to allow the government to see our amendments on the paper before we challenge a hostile decision of the house of commons the responsibility that will be thrown on the government in the interval between now and the motion to go into coumittee sic will be very great no body of men have ever faced a greater responsibility you talk of having been placed in this position by the legislation of the people who talk in this way talk like fools of that which they know not of you know not what the legislation of did it was not the coercion act of it was not the coercion act of that broke down the land league movement it was the land act of i know well the truth of what i am saying i watched from kilmainham tenants going into the land court and i say that if it had not been for the act of it would have been possible for us even from our cells in kilmainham to have pushed the land league movement to any extreme goal we chose it to reach the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the exchequer his colleagues in the government and the irish landlords may thank the right hon gentleman the member for mid lothian mr w e gladstone for the lifeboat as it was truly called at that time which he launched to their assistance he saved the irish landlords at that time and if the results of his measure have not been so fortunate as they might have been it is not for you to throw that failure in his teeth it is not for you who during nights of opposition in the house of commons obstructed the efforts of the government of the day and who subsequently in the lords cut out of the bill some of its most valuable provisions who afterwards dogged the proceedings of the commissioners by every species of intimidation at one time by motions in the house of commons and at another time by the appointment of lords commissioners to examine and heckle the land commissioners in the discharge of their duties it is not for you to taunt the government of the day with the failure of that message if it failed it failed in the first instance owing to your exertions and in the second place owing to the operation of the natural laws which brought about the fall in prices which we have since witnessed however we are now on the threshold the government have conceded something they have conceded some points they have given up as i have said a great deal of their bill will the right hon gentleman the member for the stirling burghs mr campbell bannerman who has moved this amendment consider whether under the circumstances it would not be right and fair to allow the government a little breathing time after the two very important speeches that have been delivered but especially after the very important and able speech of the noble lord the member for south paddington lord randolph churchill everybody who is concerned in this matter everybody who has any responsibility upon him should hesitate long and carefully before taking any decided step i shall be very unwilling while the mind of the government may be open for all i know it is still open i sincerely and ardently hope that it is still open while i say their minds are still open and while there is some time let us not close in hostility with them let us give them the necessary time even as long a time as is sought by the government namely till this day week for the consideration of the amendments we may place on the paper and the final making up of their minds if then the government should make up their minds against justice and in favour of sending this stone to the irish people when they have asked for bread upon them will be the sin and the shame of what may follow in ireland upon them will be the responsibility if the bill should be lost\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with loud cheers the company rising said i thank you most heartily on behalf of my colleagues and also on my own part for the honour you have done us in inviting us to the hospitalities of your beautiful club house and also for the way in which you have received the toast believe me gentlemen these kindnesses will be deeply appreciated by us and they will be deeply appreciated and long remembered by the people who have sent us over to struggle for their liberties i think that the liberal party may be well proud of the position they occupy to day it is a position which for self sacrifice and for love of principle is unequalled i believe by any position ever taken up by any political party the liberal party have always striven to do justice to ireland in the days of imperfect irish representation in the imperial parliament they tried long patiently and earnestly and it is not to their discredit it is not to the discredit of their great leader that that attempt did not succeed on the lines on which it was originally made the liberal party have acted upon principle and from deep conviction from first to last in this question they believed that it might be possible for england to govern ireland wisely and justly and well from her parliament at westminster when the franchise had been extended to ireland to the everlasting honour of your leader when it became evident owing to the extension of the franchise that the policy of the liberal party to legislate for ireland at westminster was owing to a variety of causes that were patent to all quite impossible then the mark of true greatness became visible and it was conceded to us as one of the principles of the liberal party that it was the right of the irish people to be governed by the people for the people and in accordance with the wishes of the people that is our principle and it is upon that principle we cordially shake hands with you we wish long life to the liberal party in their career of self government for ireland and of justice to the english people so far i have dealt with the past i now come to the present mr gladstone programme of self government for ireland was presented to the country under circumstances of unexampled difficulty no man with less talent with less genius with less grasp on his country could have ventured to undertake such a task it will always be associated with his memory as one of the evidences of his greatness that he was not afraid to ask first of all his party then the house of commons and then the whole country of great britain to trust the little sister country of ireland cheers no lesser man could have attempted to do it and i believe having placed his shoulder to the wheel he will carry it through and that before many years have gone by aye before many months have gone by and that the country will recognize that he is the truly great statesman to whom they have to look and that all others are pretenders imitators and tinkerers cheers when the programme of self government for ireland was rejected by the constituencies what was the course of the liberal party they asked the so called unionist party to be true to their own declarations on which they had come into power this party last session asked parliament to interfere to redress a pressing and notorious grievance at one time they said there was no time to redress it but they would consider the subject during the recess and would appoint a commission to inquire and report that commission reported in favour of the revision of judicial rents and then the government of lord salisbury turned round and said they thought the commission was wrong this unionist party had declared over and over again that they believed that if the irish land question were settled there would be no other question left they then bring forward a coercion bill on which they waste the vital part of a session their bill for settling the agrarian question they kept in the house of lords they altered it from week to week every alteration made it worse and less useful for their own purpose when it came down to the house of commons its own authors were inclined to turn against it and the changes on the part of this wonderful government commenced again the barometer had been falling all the time every week it came down three or four degrees to the disadvantage of the irish people and of the irish tenants when it got to the house of commons the barometer commenced to take jumps in the other direction those who had been able to keep pace with adverse changes to the tenantry in the bill while it was in the house of lords found themselves in a converse difficulty when it came to the commons for this wonderful unionist government not only commenced to undo much of what had been done in the house of lords but commenced to add to the bill much that had not been in it at all i ask myself as an unprejudiced outsider laughter how long the english people and the british nation who are practical commonsense people and believe in the value of time as in the value of money are going to stand the spectacle of their government and their imperial parliament marching up the hill like the king of france in olden times only to come marching down again laughter would it not have been simpler easier less expensive if they had done all this at the beginning or when their own royal commission made its recommendations why did they not adopt them then the only reason i can give is they thought they would be able to scrape through without adopted them cheers after wasting six months time the effect of five or six recent elections is that lord salisbury candidly informs his followers at the meeting at the carlton club that they could not scrape through without adopting these recommendations here is this beautiful unionist government exhibited in all its nakedness it would not do any thing it could help for the redress of irish grievances until it became evident that it could not retain office without doing something and then it says we will redress the grievances i do not think the nation will stand this kind of treatment very long every fair minded man will agree that it would be difficult to parallel the record of the last few months for its imbecility vacillations and dishonesty on the part of the rulers of this country cheers the commonsense of the people of this country will soon find out that those who attempt to rule them in this way are not fit for power and they will give them considerably less than six months notice you may depend upon it your sacrifices and exertions on behalf of ireland will not be thrown away you have already had good examples of the truth of this you have the fact that although ireland has been for the last months in the extremes of destitution and misery the record of crime instead of presenting ascending figures has been gradually diminishing cheers there has been no desire to rush into crime why because the irish people at home and abroad have recognized in the exertions of mr gladstone and of the liberal party the way in which the two nations can be brought together without dishonour to either one or the other cheers they have turned from outrage the irish people never indulged in it those who may have been inclined to turn to outrage or to turn to physical force or to methods outside of and unknown to the constitution have turned in consequence of the admission of the people to the franchise to constitutional methods cheers if nothing else had been done the liberal party might fairly claim credit for themselves and be amply rewarded in the spectacle which has been presented in ireland during the last months of the absence of crime and wrongdoing because they believe their english brothers whom they now look upon for the first time in seven centuries as brothers are about to do justice to them and are about to give them the power of doing justice for themselves if the matter were to go no further if the liberal party were to fail in its programme a failure which it would be absurd to contemplate for a moment what has been done already would be enough to reward them to bring two nations together to stop agrarian crime and outrage to banish feelings of revenge to bring a nation which though small in ireland is large and numerous in other and influential quarters to look to the law to the constitution and to parliamentary methods for the redress of their grievances is a great gain cheers no more unnecessary measure was ever brought forward than the coercion act i do not believe the government will ever use it if they really honestly and fairly proceed to carry out amendments in their present bill which have been sketched and foreshadowed by lord salisbury and if these amendments are fairly and honestly carried out in ireland and are not frustrated i do not believe they will use this coercion act and consequently it will be a standing memorial of wasted time and a proof that there was nothing in ireland to warrant such a measure there was great distress there was impossibility of paying certain rents and surely the sensible way would have been to have done what they say they are now willing to do notwithstanding the threats of the government notwithstanding their refusal of beneficial legislation notwithstanding their refusal of beneficial legislation notwithstanding numerous evictions in excess of the numbers known for many years past crime in ireland has been decreasing the fact is all to your credit and i trust it may continue to rely upon the good faith of the english liberal party that even where they are oppressed where they are trampled upon where they are evicted they will be slow to retaliate that they will remember that the conservative government will not last for ever and that from the point of view of self interest alone if not from the point of view of gratitude they will see that it would be foolish for them to throw away the splendid position which has been won for them and that they would be most ungrateful if by any words or by any act or by any programme or by any policy they were to endanger their position or to retard the progress of the great liberal party in the path of justice to ireland loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell sir the right hon gentleman the member for westminster mr w h smith in enumerating the advantages likely to arise if ireland were included in the present bill spoke of the unfortunate habit belonging to governments of being desirous to remain in office but he forgot to include also the unfortunate habit which belongs to the opposition of being desirous to come into office when i was listening to the speech of the right hon gentleman i thought i was listening to a speech delivered in opposition to a proposition for repealing the union for establishing an irish parliament or one delivered in support of a proposition for disfranchising ireland entirely i can understand the position of the right hon gentleman if he thinks that ireland ought not to be represented in this house at all and i should consider that having regard to his antecedents and the antecedents of his party and their declarations from time to time he and his party would take up a consistent position if they took advantage of the present franchise bill to ask parliament to exclude ireland entirely from parliamentary representation and to govern her as a crown colony but i cannot understand the position of the right hon gentleman opposite mr goschen who has frequently asked this house to look upon ireland as if it were just as much a part of the united kingdom as yorkshire is when he says that while not opposing or at all events not strongly opposing the extension of household suffrage to the counties of england he at the same time vehemently declines above all things to include ireland in the same measure which he is willing to give to england and scotland one would think that as the result of the inclusion of ireland in the present bill the laws to be made in future for ireland would be entirely made by the members from ireland the right hon gentleman has spoken of life and property being placed at the mercy of the majority of the people of ireland if this bill be passed but he assuredly forgets that at the outside the quota from ireland only consists of members and that there would still be more than english and scotch members a majority of whom it would be necessary to bring over to our view of the question before we could pass a single measure in reference to the franchise and after that the right hon gentleman has an additional guarantee in the existence of the house of lords to act as a still further check and safeguard against the revolutionary designs which he has been pleased on this occasion to attribute to us now what is the real extent of this terrible innovation and change which is so much deprecated in the two able speeches we have just listened to according to the most careful calculations which have been made by these best acquainted with the probabilities of the next general election it is estimated that without any extension of the present franchise and with the limited suffrage which at present exists in ireland we shall be able to return members who agree with us in opinion about strong according to the estimate which has been made by the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin mr gibson we should be able to return if the present bill passes members i am not inclined to think that we should carry as many seats as that but assuming the calculation of the right hon and learned gentleman to be correct and taking his own figures as the substantiation of his own case the addition to the strength of what the right hon gentleman the member for westminster mr w h smith promises the party of revolution in this house would be all told and i scarcely think that such a small result as that even admitting the contentions of these who oppose the bill so far as it relates to ireland will induce the liberal party or the people of england to do a deliberate act of injustice and to add another deliberate injustice to ireland by refusing these constitutional rights to the irish people of which they are at present deprived now sir the right hon gentleman the member for ripon mr goschen spoke of the question of redistribution and i think he almost entirely assumed as the basis on which he stood the rest of his case that if the course indicated by the prime minister when the question of redistribution comes to be dealt with were adopted england would be placed at a very strong disadvantage and ireland as compared with england on the basis of relationship and on the basis of the possible number of electors would have a much larger number of electors than she is entitled to i have read the letter written by the right hon gentleman the member for bradford mr forster to one of the london newspapers in which he calculates and i do not doubt that upon this calculation the right hon gentleman the member for ripon mr goschen bases his argument that ireland according to the number she would have as an electorate under this bill is only entitled to members now i do not think that that would be found to be the case and i will take the figures of course any statement with regard to the probable number of constituents under the action of this bill either in ireland or england can only be approximate the prime minister put it at the right hon and learned gentleman the member for the university of dublin mr gibson put it at mr gibson no to be strictly accurate i think the right hon and learned gentleman said and by a simple rule of three sum taking the figures of the right hon and learned gentleman as these which are most likely to be correct and i am inclined to think they are more correct than these of the prime minister if you will calculate the proportion of members who ought to belong to an electorate of and the proportion which ought to belong to the electorate which this bill proposes to give in england you will find that as regards ireland a very small reduction probably no more than six or seven would have to be made and if you calculate on the basis of the present population you can only claim a similar reduction of about six or seven a reduction which even the most ardent supporters of the right hon gentleman who spoke last mr goschen would consider to be altogether inadequate for the house to trouble their heads about i doubt very much when the time comes for estimating the number of members to be given to the three countries respectively whether it will be found either on the basis of population or on the numbers to be added to the constituencies of the three countries that you will be entitled to deprive ireland of more than six or seven of her members i would put it to the house whether it would be worth while to violate the act of union which was a treaty entered into by the representatives of the english and irish nations as far as the two countries can be said at that time to have had any representatives at all for the mere purpose of showing your spite against ireland by taking away from her the paltry number of six or seven members now sir it is admitted on all hands that the irish system of registration and the irish franchise is an utter sham and that it cannot be said to represent at all the great mass of the people in fact the members for ireland returned here are returned by an exceedingly select constituency such a constituency as the right hon gentleman the member for ripon mr goschen might be supposed from the nature of his speech to consider a sort of ideal constituency for england to show the difference between the number of persons entitled to exercise the franchise in england and ireland respectively of course there is a very great discrepancy in the borough franchise which is the lowest franchise in england the county franchise being much higher let me take the case of five english towns approaching in population five of the irish towns sheffield has a population of and there are over electors while dublin with a population of or within of sheffield has only electors or less than one third that of sheffield blackburn with a population of over has electors cork with a population of has only electors chatham with a population of has electors limerick with a population of has only electors newcastle on tyne with a population of has electors belfast with a population of has only and while aylesbury with a population of has over electors londonderry with a population of has only electors the same disproportion is evident all through and if hon members will for themselves occupy their time by going a little into the question they will find that the general result of the proportion of parliamentary electors to the population in all the english boroughs is one in 7½ or 13¼ per cent whereas in the irish boroughs it is one in 15½ or less than 6½ per cent if you take the whole of the population of the two countries including boroughs and counties into the calculation it will be found that in england the proportion of electors to population is per cent whereas in ireland it is only 4⅓ percent in fact with your present franchise in england if you were to stand still and if you were to bring in a separate bill for the purpose of enlarging the franchise in ireland so as to make it equal to that which at present exists in england you would only be doing the merest act of justice to ireland an act which the liberal party has frequently pledged itself to do in this and the last parliament but in the course of this debate it seems that parliament has been asked to pursue its road of injustice towards ireland still further by enlarging the franchise in england beyond what it is at present and thus increasing the inequality which exists between england and ireland but perhaps unforeseen results might flow from the passing of this franchise bill i have said that the irish members are not really the representatives of the people of ireland but that they are the representatives of a very select constituency indeed being practically speaking the representatives of the middle classes may it not happen by the creation of fresh political interests in that country and by the bringing in of the masses of the people within the pale of the constitution that you may create differences of opinions and divisions in the party lines which do not at present exist in any case it is admitted that one of the great evils regarding the political state of ireland is that there are only two interests the interest of a very small minority of the people who live here as opposed to the agricultural interests of the majority of the middle classes of that country it may happen as it has happened in england by the creation of fresh interests and by the admission of new classes that you may create a counterpoise to the very excessive as some people consider it tension which the irish farmers have been demanding of late years from the legislature i do not say what my own opinion is but if you are to govern ireland constitutionally if you are to govern her under a representative system if you are going still to permit her members to come here and represent the irish constituencies in this house you cannot with the slightest show of consistency and with the slightest scrap of self respect deny her the same franchise as that which you claim for this country for my own part i believe that the interests with which we who sit upon these benches have been prominently identified within the last few years will survive even such injustice as that i have shown and that our forces will be very slightly increased by this very important measure i believe that the real reason why hon gentlemen on this side of the house are opposing this measure is not because they fear that it will lead to a disproportion and to too great an increase of political power among the irish nationalists but because they fear it will strengthen the radical and the liberal party to such an extent as to render their own exclusion from political power permanent and they therefore make such appeals to passion and to prejudice in this country as they think may be effectual for their purpose they are in reality fighting under the irish problem the extension of political privileges to the mass of the english people of this country it is really their power in the counties which they believe to be threatened and not the disintegration of the empire or the dissolution of all things in ireland into their original elements i believe we shall find as the discussion of this bill proceeds that that design will become more and more evident and that the great attack will after a time be developed the feint of the present proceeding having been abandoned as useless and absurd in support of my contention while i say that we do not own that this measure as regards our own position and prospects will lead to such an increase in our forces as may be necessary for our purposes in the next general election even under the present most imperfect system of registration i wish to point out that in every contest which has taken place since the general election for any seats which we won at the general election we have been uniformly victorious by considerable and increased majorities we have carried four seats in addition from the liberal party fourteen contests have resulted in the return of professed home rule members four contests for four seats carried by followers of the right hon gentleman the prime minister at the general election have resulted also in the return of members of our party and we have only been beaten in four constituencies where we never had at any time a footing and in each case we have been beaten by the conservative party in reality it is not so much the irish conservatives who have to fear the loss of their power or the loss of their seats by this bill as the followers of the right hon gentleman the prime minister himself the proposer of this bill because i believe it would leave the power of the conservatives in the north and other portions of ireland where they hold seats very much as it is but it would enable the seats held by the followers of the right hon gentleman the prime minister to be successfully attacked i think this fortifies my contention that the opposition now being made against this bill is really a feint and is intended to conceal the real objects of these who oppose the measure and who hope by trading on ignorant prejudices and passions to prevent the enfranchisement of the mass of the english people for ourselves we are confident of the result we accept our inclusion in the bill as a measure of equity to which we are entitled we should have been very much surprised if the prime minister with his record and if his party had tolerated any other course than that which has been adopted but whether we are to be included in this bill or whether we are not to be included in it we feel confident in the justice of our cause and in the devotion of our people who will unable sic us to carry to a triumphant conclusion the principles which we stand here to maintain as regards the rest i have every confidence that this house will refuse to be made a party to the perpetration of what would be neither more nor less than an outrage on the unenfranchised people of ireland if they are to go back upon the declaration of the prime minister and to shut the door of the constitution in the face of the people of our country\n",

      "mr parnell replying to the toast of his health proposed by mr john redmond said in his opinion the success of the party and of the irish movement was due not to himself but to a combination of forces the irish people at home the irish abroad and the efforts of the irish parliamentary party as to the success of the party and its unity he attributed it in a great degree to the fact that every member of it from the highest to the youngest was entitled to freely express his opinion at its consultations and to bring to bear upon the consideration of every question such influences and arguments as he could command every member of the party could express his opinion on all the questions that came before them and so could influence the votes of each of his colleagues this was a very important factor in the present position of the irish party and so long as they acted together so long should they deserve that confidence from the irish nation to which mr redmond had alluded they would be willing to wait and find themselves justified by results the irish party at present was a small party but it was an unbroken party and it was a growing party greater confidence was bring felt in it not only by the irish people but by sections and bodies who hitherto have not been identified with its views it was to him a source of great gratification when he found that leaders of particular sections were looking to them for counsel and advice that they are disposed even those who have been considered less inclined to regard them with favour to look upon the irish party as the only intelligent representative of national opinion and the only efficient means for securing beneficial reforms in ireland with the added numbers that the general election will bring with the increased weight said mr parnell that the union of ireland has added to our forces and with the determined energy which i anticipate all the provinces will bring to bear at the general election i anticipate that the result will be of the utmost importance in the triumphal solution of the irish question and we shall find when we shall be able to speak with the voice of a united ireland and with the majority of its representatives from every province as members of our party that not many days will elapse before we shall be able to obtain the fullest measure of self government that has entered into the ideas of reasonable irishmen\n",

      "mr parnell i think sir it would be proper for me in the commencement of what i have to say upon the amendment of my hon friend the member for westmeath mr harrington to draw the attention of the house to what that amendment really asks one would suppose from the line of defence which has been taken by the two government speakers that we were asking the house here with all the difficulties attending a parliamentary investigation into judicial proceedings for a particular inquiry in order to do away with and annul the verdict under which three men were executed and under which five men are now suffering penal servitude for life neither we nor the amendment ask for that we simply ask for an inquiry and in making out our case for that inquiry we have brought forward evidence which is evidently too strong for the government defenders since they say or practically admit or lead us to suppose that if this inquiry be granted the reversal of that verdict will necessarily follow apart from the strength of our case or the nature of the evidence that we should be prepared to bring before the tribunal or body which we ask this house to appoint for the investigation of this important matter we claim that if any reliance is to be placed for the future upon the pledged credit of a responsible minister of the crown if in our debates we can take the words of a minister of the crown to mean what they were evidently intended to moan when uttered that the government are bound by all the considerations of honour and of regard for their word to give that inquiry or some inquiry of the kind which we now ask from this house it is true that the noble marquess the secretary of state for war the marquess of hartington upon the two separate occasions when his promises were made in the late hours of almost the last day of last session did guard himself by an if he protected himself from pledging himself definitely to any particular inquiry but he did promise us most definitely some inquiry into this matter if the allegations which were made by my hon friends in the debate which produced his two speeches turned out to be correct on the first occasion when the subject was raised on the motion for going into committee on the appropriation bill the noble marquess wound up his statement to the house by this declaration if the statements appear to be vouched for in the manner i have described inquiry will be made hansard the only condition was that the statements should be vouched for in the manner the noble marquess had described and the manner in which those statements were to be vouched for was that his grace the archbishop of tuam should vouch for the statement of facts as detailed on that evening by my hon friends in debate on the second occasion when my hon friends desirous of having some clearer statement or pledge from the noble marquess recurred to the matter on the same evening when the house had gone into committee the noble marquess said he refrained from absolutely promising that an inquiry should be instituted for it was premature to say what would be the statement vouched for by the archbishop of tuam or any other person who might make representations to the government all he had ventured to say on the case as presented to him all he could say was he would promise that the irish government should take any representation made to them into consideration and if the facts appeared to be as they had been alleged to be that night then an inquiry should be made ibid the only condition attached to granting some inquiry was that the facts should be found on inquiry to be as stated by my hon friend mr harrington these facts had reference to statements made before the archbishop by one of the informers and of the confession by this informer that all he swore on the trial was false perjured and dictated by a desire to save his life and it is impossible for us to believe that the noble marquess when making that statement did not absolutely intend that if it was found that the facts as stated by my hon friend were correct a full fair and impartial inquiry would have been granted into this most grave and important question i believe the issues involved in the matter are more important than any matter ever brought by my hon friends before the house and i feel convinced that the conviction is gaining in strength day by day that some of the irish government officials have very good reasons why they consider that this inquiry should not be granted they know that if the dying depositions of the two guilty men who were executed in galway goal two years ago depositions which admitted their own guilt and bore the strongest testimony to the innocence of myles joyce and of four out of the five who were convicted and who are now suffering penal servitude they know that if these depositions were produced that the house would be unable to resist the granting of this motion why have these depositions been withheld the right hon gentleman the late chief secretary to the lord lieutenant is very anxious that these depositions should not be produced and in fact he is so anxious that he absolutely stooped to misrepresent the statement of the prime minister to this house he sought in his speech to pin the prime minister to a statement which that right hon gentleman never made he said that the prime minister had refused to grant the depositions the prime minister never did so he was appealed to in an offhand manner by one of my hon friends mr callan and he said in reply that it was not usual in such cases to grant them but he never absolutely refused to grant them he never did what he was represented to have done by the late chief secretary for ireland refused to grant them and until he does absolutely refuse i will refuse to believe that he will do so we have a very strong case that is admitted and i believe that if it had not been for the apprehension that so great and so good a man as earl spencer if it were not for the apprehension that so great and good a man as earl spencer had made a mistake and a fatal mistake as regarded the life of one of his fellow creatures we should have had the production of these depositions failing in that we have had an inquiry into the case of kilmartin an inquiry first of all refused to us by the late chief secretary for ireland and which was afterwards granted to us in the absence of the right hon gentleman by the noble marquess the secretary of state for war with the result that kilmartin who had been sentenced to penal servitude was released and restored to his family now sir i believe we should have had this inquiry and i must protest against the tone of the right hon gentleman the late chief secretary for ireland he almost let the cat out of the bag in an eloquent and powerful passage in his speech when he gave the house to understand for no other inference could be derived from that passage that if the lord lieutenant had made a mistake and the mistakes in question involved the life of one person and the liberties of others that if the lord lieutenant had made such grave mistakes he mr trevelyan would feel consolation that was his expression for these mistakes by the fact that crime and outrage in ireland had been put an end to and that the majesty of the law had teen sic vindicated that is our whole contention that there are officials in ireland who consider it is their highest duty to use every means and all means legitimate and otherwise to put down crime and outrage uphold the majesty of the law and restore law and order i say that if that is the position of the chief secretary for ireland no more fatal mistake was ever made by any predecessor of his than to suppose that they can ever obtain the respect of the irish people for law and order until they thoroughly purify and purge their tribunals from the suspicion of partiality and injustice which cases like this must throw upon them until then it is impossible to suppose that the irish people can have that confidence in law and order and can have that desire to uphold law and order in ireland without which you will never be able to govern certainly never even with such a coercion act as now stains the statute book now i wish to say that our case rests not as represented by the late chief secretary for ireland solely on the testimony of an informer and a murderer who admitted formerly on the trial that he was a murderer and now admits again that he is a murderer and who desires to unsay what he has said our case rests not upon this but upon a vast variety of other facts it is pure irony of the right hon gentleman to say and it is misleading the house for him to say that our case rests on the evidence of casey the informer i say throw away the informer casey put his evidence out of the case altogether disregard it as the lord lieutenant now wishes to do put him on one side and i say we have as strong and unanswerable a case as if we had no casey at all we have the evidence of the three independent witnesses themselves its improbable character its inconsistency with itself and with the evidence of the other informers the impossibility of the alleged case of identification on the dark night of the murder the physical impossibility of the story being true these were amongst the grounds on which they based their cases the fact is that in several instances in which those independent witnesses swore that they were in a certain position from which they could identify persons at a considerable distance on a dark night it was physically impossible for them to do so even in broad daylight any more than it would be possible for anyone sitting on that side of the house to see a member in the division lobby through the wall if i say standing here that i could see through the wall opposite no person here would believe me this trial was held a distance from the locale of the murder some days were given for counsel for the accused to prepare the defence the journey to the place involved a whole day railway travelling and portions of the night by horse conveyance and the same time back only guineas were allowed to the counsel described by the hon and learned gentleman the solicitor general for ireland as one of the most celebrated in ireland only guineas were allowed to enable him to travel all that journey and make his investigations in an irish speaking district where the only interpreters were the police who could not be used for the purpose twenty guineas would have been little enough to give a surveyor for making the plans and drawings that were necessary and one of my charges against the irish officials is that they deliberately neglected to have the proper plans prepared no detailed plans were made of the house and the positions which the witnesses swore that they occupied on the night in question it was therefore impossible for the counsel to test the accuracy of the witnesses on those important points the defence in fact was so crippled that it was impossible for the counsel representing the accused to do their duty by their clients it was made impossible for the defence to obtain by cross examination the necessary information with which to rebut the testimony of the informers therefore although four of the men happened to be guilty the whole trial was a farce and a prostitution of justice and the conviction was obtained upon perjury of a most infamous character committed by the witnesses one of whom the approver swore that he was standing in the same place where the throe independent witnesses swore they were at the time the alleged identification took place an adjournment for reexamination of the district after the approvers evidence which was absolutely new was refused nor was leave given to go into a rebutting case now i think i had better explain to the house as there is considerable confusion as to names by giving an outline of it what the crown case was against the persons charged and what our case now is by the light of subsequent revelations the government case was that the murder was committed by men three of these men have been hanged and the guilt of two out of these three we admit five of the were sentenced to penal servitude for life and two of the turned approvers we also admit the guilt of one of the five who were sent to penal servitude but we strenuously assert and can prove on inquiry the absolute innocence of the remaining four we also admit the guilt of one of the two approvers but say that the second in our opinion is innocent and that he was compelled by fear of death to swear to that which was absolutely false no adequate motive for the commission of the crime was assigned at the trial by the crown against any of these men it was partly suggested that the murder was the outcome of a general conspiracy in ireland and the result of an order issued from some secret tribunal at a distance and for the purpose the names of two men kelly and nee were brought into the case by one of the witnesses who turned approver but as this addition would have made the supposed number of those who committed the deed instead of and as the other witnesses had sworn that the number was the attempt to impute the motive suggested by the evidence of the approver was not persisted in by the crown therefore afterwards all the witnesses independent and otherwise swore to now on the other hand we have it in our power to present the strongest motives for the commission of the crime by the persons we can prove guilty our case is that seven and not committed this murder that of these seven two have been rightly executed and are undoubtedly guilty and that one is in penal servitude who is also guilty and who admits his guilt and strange to say protests the innocence of the other men we however protest that the other men whom the jury have found guilty are innocent the irish members also hold that one of the two approvers is among the guilty that two of the guilty men are at large at this moment in the locality where the murder was committed one of them being the ringleader and paymaster of the local ribbon society to which they belonged and that another of the miscreants is now in england according to our case a motive can easily be assigned for the crime we can prove that the murdered mail was the treasurer of a ribbon society that he had been accused of making away with some of the funds an accusation which is alway sic sufficient to insure the murder of the person accused and that on more than one occasion he had attempted to shoot the leader and paymaster of the gang who murdered him we can also prove that the murdered man was a notoriously bad character a ribbon man and a sheep stealer and that he was murdered in accordance with the decree of a local ribbon society as a punishment for offences against the society and against his neighbours it must also be borne in mind that the independent witnesses who have given testimony against the men who were tried had lived on the worst of terms with the majority of the men whom they accused and had been involved in litigation with them in consequence of boundary disputes on one occasion anthony joyce the chief of the independent witnesses had a fight with myles joyce in which he was worsted he then had recourse to law and myles joyce was sentenced to be imprisoned for two or three months in fact the independent witnesses at the trial formed one faction and the accused persons another and the result was that when the murder was announced the three independent witnesses held a family council and agreed among themselves as to who were likely to have desired the death of the murdered man by guess work they were able to indicate three or four of the assassins and by implicating the remainder of the prisoners they not only obtained a large reward but avenged themselves against such of their neighbours as were obnoxious to them it is a terrible thing to think that murder so atrocious could be deliberately planned for such an object but unfortunately it is but too true that in these wild districts of the country the smallest pretexts are sometimes sufficient for the commission of such crime i invite the house to put out of consideration altogether for the moment the evidence of the two informers the hon and learned gentleman the solicitor general for ireland said in his defence of the government the other night that the depositions that were made in the case were all produced now it is a part of the case of the irish members that the depositions of the two young joyces the survivors of the massacre and which would have discredited the evidence of the independent witnesses were deliberately withheld by the crown by mr bolton who was the solicitor in charge of the crown proceedings from the cognizance of the counsel for the defence that we contend was a disadvantage additional to all the other disadvantages with which counsel had to contend the hon and learned solicitor general for ireland first of all denied point blank that any depositions had been withheld then he mended that a little and said there were no depositions withheld and that all that had been withheld had been declarations and informations he said all the depositions were given however having a little more time owing to some interruptions on the part of my hon friends interruptions which i very much deprecate because i think it would have been much better if they had allowed the hon and learned gentleman to flounder on i will not say with his untruthful but at any rate his unfounded statements he was allowed to collect his thoughts and after having done so he said that all the depositions given at the inquest were supplied to the defenders of the prisoners but sir these learned gentlemen did not want the depositions given at the inquest because they had them already they were matters of notoriety and had been published in the newspapers but what these gentlemen had not received and what should have been given to them were the two dying depositions that it was impossible for them to get these were withheld and that we have on the admission of the hon and learned gentleman the solicitor general for ireland the hon and learned gentleman was compelled to renounce his miserable quibbling about the difference between depositions and declarations he was compelled to admit that the depositions had been withheld and to enter into his ridiculous explanation of the reasons why they were withheld sir the depositions which i refer to the depositions of the two boys who were both supposed to be dying although one afterwards recovered were duly taken by the stipendiary magistrate having charge of the case they were duly attested by the magistrate and they from the circumstances in which he took them and the internal evidence in them show that they were drafted and taken to be used as evidence for the crown and that no idea had presented itself to the mind of the magistrate that the two boys were not in a fit position to make depositions as a matter of fact one of them was because he recovered and having recovered and having received a good education from the good christian brothers at artane industrial schools contrasting somewhat with the education he had received whilst in the custody of george bolton he is able and willing now he is recovered to corroborate the testimony he then gave these depositions had reference to the blackened faces of the assassins the independent witnesses had sworn as the result of their constant observation of the alleged assassins that constant observation extending throughout three miles during which the witnesses stated they were close to the assassins positively to the features of the men and also that they wore dark clothes well in the suppressed depositions of the two boys who were themselves amongst the victims of the attack and it must be remembered that these boys had an opportunity of seeing closely by the light of torches the features of the murderers it was set forth that the men had blackened faces and that they wore white jackets the boys stated this repeatedly and first of all informed the policeman of it the constable who came to ask about the murder the morning it was discovered they said the men had their faces blackened and wore white jackets well such a remarkable discrepancy as that which existed between the evidence of the principal witnesses would if it had been known to the counsel for the defence at the time of the trial have been taken hold of and strongly represented to the jury but he was absolutely ignorant of these facts the two depositions were suppressed this was not evidence given by informers a long time after the massacre but evidence given by two of the persons attacked a day or two after the occurrence the depositions were studiously kept from the jury but not from the judge because if he had chosen to look through the brief of the learned counsel for the prosecution the brief which has fallen into our hands he might have found these two depositions and he might also have noticed the remark patrick joyce has recovered but his evidence is worthless well these vital documents were withheld from the prisoners counsel why i really think we should have a more satisfactory attempt at an explanation for the withholding of such documents than we have yet received the right hon gentleman the late chief secretary for ireland left the point to be dealt with by his hon and learned friend the solicitor general for ireland but i venture to say that no one who heard the hon and learned gentleman defence can feel satisfied in his conscience that that defence was satisfactory but the irish members charge other suppressions against the crown they charge the crown with the suppression of the declarations made by philbin the first statements made to mr bolton were not furnished to the counsel for the prisoners the government in their defence rely upon the technical point that these statements were not depositions but declarations if the evidence had been the evidence of an approver who was in prison counsel for the defence would have obtained knowledge of it in the ordinary way because he would have been present and would have made application for it in that case the depositions could not have been withheld but owing to the fact that some of the proceedings took place in the secrecy of the gaol the crown thought they might venture upon their suppression i ask every fair minded englishman whether trying those ignorant peasants with all the disadvantages that necessarily attend their defence should evidence of this kind be withheld from the ordinary investigations which the counsel for the defence would under other circumstances have made sir i venture to say that the answer will be no the answer will be that the crown officials charged with the prosecution acted unfairly in this matter and in such a way as to defeat the ends of justice by withholding these depositions and that according to the dictates of honour honesty and of a desire to secure a fair trial which must even be present occasionally in the bosom of a crown solicitor in ireland they must stand condemned in this matter i do not wish to trouble the house by going into the details again my hon friends have done that for me very fully but no attempt has been really made by the government to meet our case i could go on for another hour if the house would derive any satisfaction from my doing so but in default of a reply from the government i do not think it is necessary to do so if the house is satisfied with the trial and punishment of these men nothing that i could say would be of any use but if on the other hand the house is not satisfied and thinks there has been a defect in these proceedings that these men were tried under circumstances of great public excitement when a large section of the public were clamouring for blood and when the irish executive were thirsting eagerly for convictions and if the house considers that an investigation of the case is desirable and there has been ample means placed in its hand for making up its mind in the pamphlet which has been circulated by the hon member for westmeath mr harrington if the house thinks this and that there is a considerable discrepancy in the evidence of the witnesses and that the statements of the approvers in the light of the evidence of independent witnesses is unreliable on many important points if on reflection it is thought that the suppression of the two depositions made by the dying lad and his brother were vitally important to the defence and that the crown prosecutors were culpable in not producing them then i say the house will vote for the amendment of my hon friend it may be said by the late chief secretary for ireland it has been said that the foundations of law and justice in ireland would be shaken if this inquiry were granted well sir i deny it i believe that if the irish executive could show that it was strong enough to grant this inquiry the result whatever it might be would from the point of view of the executive itself be beneficial because you cannot smother this matter it is there it is of such a nature that it will receive attention when it is brought up again and again and if an unwilling executive in ireland fearful for the stability of its own position knowing well that there has been injustice done refuses inquiry to day and if the government supports it in that refusal under a threat of resignation from lord spencer at any rate the day must come when such an inquiry will be instituted and when the whole truth and nothing but the truth will be known in reference to the maamtrasna massacre mr parnell asked the right hon gentleman whether the fact that these depositions had been made was really brought to the knowledge of the counsel for the defence\n",

      "mr parnell said he fully agreed with what had been said by several speakers as to the experimental character of this measure so far as the probabilities were concerned that the boards of guardians as the sanitary authorities in rural districts would make sufficient use of it still at the same time in considering the local authority they should name in the bill as the authority to put the provisions of the act in force they were bound to take advantage of the only materials which existed it might or might not be that the sanitary authorities were not the best authorities which could be constituted for the purpose of the bill but at the same time they were practically speaking the only authorities which existed in the irish counties at the present moment within the rural sanitary districts and he and his friends therefore felt compelled to make the best use of them they could he himself thought that in a great many cases the sanitary authorities would take suitable action for the benefit of the labourers while of course there could be no doubt that in other cases they would be remiss in their duties as public bodies very often were he did not attach very much importance to the analogy drawn by the hon and gallant member for the county cork colonel colthurst in directing attention to the subject of the neglect of the sanitary authorities hitherto to take adequate advantage of the powers intrusted to them because he thought that probably boards of guardians composed as they largely were of farmers and others who did not attach very much value to drains of any kind so far as their own houses were concerned were the last persons who would institute the works of sanitary importance in the towns under their charge which they were hitherto empowered to make but as regarded the question of the erection of labourers dwellings he anticipated to a great extent an entirely different result he thought the farmers would be anxious to see the best use made of available sites for the purpose of housing their labourers he knew that many farmers objected to have labourers living on their farms in separate dwellings the reasons they gave were various but as a matter of fact he knew that the objection very largely prevailed it might not however take place where sites might be found obtainable in fields and towns within the area of the sanitary authorities or where it might be possible to purchase waste nooks of land the loss of which would not inconvenience anybody for the purpose of forming clusters of little houses for the benefit of the labourers he himself had always felt it would be of great importance to give the labourer a house to live in and a small garden plot apart from the immediate influence of his employer he thought that every person who sold his labour was entitled to have a house to dwell in and that he should not be compelled to look for shelter for himself and his family to the success of his exertions in coming to an agreement with the man who employed him in other words he thought the employer of labour was given an unfair advantage over the labourer in this respect that when a dispute as to wages or any other subject arose it should result in the loss of shelter to the labourer and his family so far as a roof tree and a small plot of ground went the government ought to place the labourer in an independent position that was the principle taken up in the artizans dwellings act as regarded the artizans in towns they now simply asked that the principle which had been worked out successfully by corporations in towns of inhabitants and upwards should be extended to rural authorities in ireland who governed much larger numbers of people they excepted from the operation of the bill urban authorities who did not come within the operation of the artizans dwellings act he thought they ought not to be entitled to the permissive powers given by this bill should it be passed he hoped the bill would be read a second time and speaking for them he said that himself and his friends who were responsible for the bill would do their best to make it workable in committee indeed he thought it was workable already because its provisions were all adapted to suit the special circumstances of the case from the artizans dwellings act and he did not think so far as any alterations in committee went that it would be possible to add very much to make it workable the chief doubt in his mind was the doubt expressed by many speakers as to whether it would be possible to get boards of guardians to carry out the provisions of the act satisfactorily he thought some would do so and more would make no effort to do so but in two cases the land acts of and the house had legislated in a different direction for the benefit of the labourers and both these attempts had been failures they therefore asked the house now to go in the direction indicated by this bill the principle of which had already proved most successful in the operation of the artizans dwellings act in the large towns of england and ireland and they believed it would go to a very considerable extent to redress the sufferings and evils under which a patient and long suffering class in ireland had laboured for so long he felt sure that the law abiding qualities which had been exhibited by the irish labourers as a class would commend their case to the attention of parliament and that the house would not think the time occupied in committee in shaping this non contentious and non political bill had been lost and that something might be done to benefit this meritorious class of her majesty subjects\n",

      "mr parnell m p who was received with loud and prolonged cheers said fellow countrymen it always gives me the greatest pleasure to find myself addressing a northern audience i think it does us southern representatives good to come amongst the keen and quick witted people of the north and certainly the magnificent meetings which i have seen yesterday and to day afford me the greatest possible encouragement to renew those visits to these parts of ireland that have always given me such great pleasure in the past cheers as father o'connor reminded me just now it was in a neighbouring northern county the county cavan where i first ventured in to lay down that land platform which has since been partly carried into law by the land act of cheers and which i trust will be fully and completely carried into law and practical effect before many years if you return my friend mr healy at the head of the poll a voice we will do that cheers mr parnell and if you follow up that victory by other victories equally signal and equally great in other northern constituencies the land platform which was adopted at the cavan meeting to which i have just referred and which provided for the abolition of rackrents and the creation of an occupying proprietary will be an accomplished fact the land act of profess to carry out both these objects but it has carried them out both as regards abolition of rackrents and more especially as regards the creation of a peasant proprietary in so imperfect a fashion that it is already in need of amendment and extension cheers a voice you will make it all right mr parnell during the passage of that act through parliament my friend mr healy and others of my colleagues in parliament were instrumental in inserting valuable provisions into the measure cheers amongst others must be mentioned the celebrated healy clause of which you have heard cheers the healy clause was only one of the many important provisions inserted in the act owing to the abilities of mr healy but notwithstanding all that we could do it still remains the imperfect measure which i shall shortly describe to you it is necessary that you the people of monaghan just as the people of every other part of ireland should continue to struggle and convert the promises of that enactment into a reality a voice so we will mr parnell up to the present time the lawyers have gotten far too much of the benefits of the act and the people far too little in fact the working of the act reminds me very much of a dispute which happened in olden times between two country farmers who fell out with each other just in the same way as farmers are in the habit of falling out in these days only instead of falling out with each other they are more likely to fall out the landlord at present cheers they called in a lawyer to arbitrate between them the dispute being about an oyster which one or both of them claimed to have found his judgment was as follows a shell for thee and a shell for thee and the oyster is the lawyers fee cheers and laughter and so it has happened under the land act up to the present time it has been computed by the best and most well informed authorities that the lawyers and the solicitors have got far more money in costs and in one way or the other out of the land act than the tenants got in reductions of rents cheers i should describe to you and shall as shortly as possible the imperfections in the land act which we believe if we are assisted by you and by other constituencies we will be able to amend within a short time in the first place there is the date of the fixing of the judicial rent at present the rent dates from the date of the decision of the court we endeavoured to effect that that rent should date from the date of the application of the tenant to the court but we were overruled by the majority of the house of commons and found it impossible to carry it into effects by the act of there are some tenancies in ireland of which about are subject to the operation of the land act up to the present after nearly two years of working the land commissioners have only adjudicated upon about cases out of these and it is a poor look out for the tenant farmer that he will have to wait perhaps five or six years if he lodged his claim in court to pay the old rack rent during all these years before the land commission will be able to reach his case and lower his rent by the defect in the land act the landlord is offered an inducement to refuse to settle with his tenantry out of court because he sees that owing to the block of cases in court it will be impossible for the land commissioners to reach his case for several years and that meanwhile he will be able to exact the old rack rent from his tenants now one of the provisions and a very important provision it is in its way which we intend to strive for and i have reasonable expectation of obtaining it if we succeed in reopening the land question again will be that when the land commission has decided the entire case that the rent shall date back from the date of the application cheers and that until the land commission court is able to decide that case the tenants shall not be compelled in the provinces outside ulster to pay a greater rent than the poor law or griffith valuation and inside ulster not be compelled to pay more than per cent or per cent under the valuation cheers we consider that that is a rough and ready way of settling the question of what the rent shall be pending the decision of the court and one which will recommend itself to the senses of right of every impartial person and is a provision which we ought to be able to carry within a short time cheers i come next to the question of the improvements of the tenants cheers a voice that the grievance mr parnell at present it is practically speaking the practice of the sub commissioners in fixing the fair commercial or letting value of the holding to throw overbard sic the healy clause altogether it is just as if it had never been put into the bill because the land commissioners in fixing the rent simply estimate a fair letting value as between landlord and tenant sic and have no regard whatever to the improvements of the tenants i have been very much struck in passing through monaghan as well as in other counties to see the large proportion of letting the value of the land let to the tenants has evidently been derived from the improvements effected on the land by the tenants or their predecessors in title mr healy hear hear mr parnell looking at this question from a practical point of view and with some knowledge of agriculture i am convinced that if the healy clause were properly carried into effect and fairly worked and if the tenants were allowed for the improvements which they have effected upon their holdings within even a very recent period say within thirty or forty years not to go any further the result would be that instead of a reduction of only twenty per cent the rents of this county certainly and of most of the northern ones would be and ought to be reduced by fully one half cheers you thus see the great importance of the healy clause cheers it is not so much what the particular effect of the healy clause has been up to the present time for as i have said it has been of very little practical effect in reducing the rents because the land commissioners owing to the decision in adams and dunseath have disregarded it altogether but it is as regards its importance when it has been amended and when its principles are properly and fairly administered that i would speak to you about and mind you the landlords know this very well hear hear they know that if the healy clause were restored to its original position that it occupied before the land act went to the house of lords and was cut down and before the judgment in adams and dunseath was delivered the result would be in many of the irish counties that the rents would be reduced by one half at least and the landlords know well too that if this land question is allowed to remain unsettled and the question fought out on behalf of the tenants the healy clause will be amended and the rents so reduced cheers and what have they done they put up lord george hamilton in the house of commons the other night to bring forward a motion that the tenants should be allowed to purchase their holdings on the basis of judicial rents as at present fixed they foresee that what i said to you will happen and they are anxious to get out of their position as landlords and put the state in the position they now occupy cheers so that you are in this position you can either offer the irish landlords the healy clause restored to its original form and shape before it left the house of commons for the house of lords or you can say to them we are willing to purchase our holdings from you at such a price and on such terms and conditions as will enable us to pay the annual instalments of the purchase money and live and thrive in our homes cheers you have the double string to your bow cheers and your position is consequently a very powerful one cheers as i said before the lords know this better than you recognise it yourselves and our purpose in coming to monaghan for this election contest is to enable us to bring back a message to the house of commons that the north of ireland any more than the south or west of ireland is not satisfied with the irish land act of cheers they are determined and will insist on the amendment of that act in the direction i have mentioned cheers another deficiency in the act is the question of leaseholders i do not know whether this is a matter that very much concerns this county or not but it is certainly a pressing grievance in other parts of ireland and whether it concerns you or not in this county it is your duty to help your brethren in other parts of ireland who happen to be leaseholders in obtaining the benefits of the act of cheers a voice we want it here too mr parnell fully one third of some of the best land in ireland is in the occupation of leaseholders and it comes to this that the landlords in excluding the leaseholders from the act of saved one third of the goods which they had stolen in former times from the people of ireland cheers a voice the landlords are thieves mr parnell i trust that a question of considerable practical importance to many farmers in the north and the judgment given on the question in the court of common pleas the other day will be satisfactorily settled and that the court of appeal in dublin will reverse the decision of the court of common pleas with regard to the date of the fixing of the judicial rents in the case of some tenants who applied on the first occasion upon which the court of land commission sat hear hear the matter is of some considerable practical importance and i trust the judgment of the court of appeal in dublin will render it unnecessary for us to include in our list of reforms the subject in question i don't wish to delay you any longer i have already spoken to you at considerable length and in conclusion i would impress on you that on the result of this election will depend whether the government will adhere to their position that the irish land act of settles the land question or whether they will reopen that question and complete the reforms which are so urgently needed for the purpose of developing the agricultural resources of ireland and of securing the peace and happiness of her inhabitants loud and prolonged cheers mr parnell said i have great pleasure in proposing a vote of thanks to the rev mr o'connor for his kindness in presiding at our meeting to day and for giving to the people the sanction which the presence and support of a clergyman of father o'connor position always gives to the popular cause cheers in speaking of father o'connor i may also allude to and express acknowledgements to the catholic clergymen of the country generally i have been one of those who have strenuously resisted the attempts of the government to prevent the catholic clergy from taking their due part in political affairs cheers i say we have strenuously and successfully resisted that effort and we have been able to preserve to every clergyman in every denomination the right to take a part which every free citizen is entitled to take in political matters when they come forward i am pleased to say that the catholic clergy of the county monaghan have been by the side of their parishioners in this struggle and that while using no undue influence and not attempting in any way unduly to bias the particular opinions of their flocks they have given them that temperate and wise and dignified advice which always so much becomes a clergyman of any church to bestow cheers i feel sure the people of this county will see it is their duty and their interest to support mr healy cheers and so to obtain for themselves the service of one who is unequalled by his ability and devotion amongst those who have struggled for the rights of the irish people cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with loud and prolonged cheering said i have felt very much obliged to the executive of the league for asking me to attend this convention and i have looked forward with the greatest interest to the proceedings to be taken to day because i attach the greatest possible importance to the work and action of this organisation during the next twelve months i think in all likelihood that during the next year the issue will be taken upon the approaching general election and there can be no doubt whatever that upon the action taken by the irish electors of great britain will depend the fate of this approaching political struggle as to whether this country is to be governed in a new parliament by a conservative or by a liberal ministry in view of this probability almost certainly it becomes of the greatest importance that our organisation in england should be ruled by a body possessing the confidence of the branches and dominated by the same policy and i think also that it should consist of a small number of men hear hear you have tried the system of gigantic executives consisting of and more members you have tried to form an executive upon which the great centres in england and scotland should be represented on which liverpool manchester glasgow newcastle upon tyne and the other important irish centres should have members and the result has been that it has been found almost impossible for the members of the executive living and having their occupations in cities and localities far off from the place of session of the executive to have any voice whatever in the deliberations of the executive or any control or influence in its proceedings hear hear and it has always happened that the executive thus constituted has simply become the local executive of the place in which its sessions are held hear hear for instance since the executive has been moved to london we have found that it has been almost entirely a local london executive an executive consisting of members of the london branches and that on hardly any occasion have the members of the executive elected by the other great towns of england and scotland taken the trouble or been able to attend the deliberations of the central body therefore it must be admitted that the principle of election by the branches to the executive has broken down as a practical scheme hear hear and we are thrown back upon the consideration of devising some substitute in the shape of a body which shall possess the confidence of the branches and at the same time always be in a position to attend to the important duties which in this year above all other years will most likely have to be performed by the executive i have attended this convention and listened with the utmost attention to what has been said by the various gentlemen who have addressed it and it appears to me that there is a very strong feeling that the resolution which has been proposed by mr lydon should be the resolution to meet with the final acceptance of this convention namely that you should entrust your fortunes at all events for this year and as a trial to a small executive chosen mainly if not entirely from members of the irish parliamentary party hear hear and applause i think that without any doubt the branches in the important resolutions which will have to be taken by them during the coming months will look with confidence for advice and direction to such a body hear hear and that there would be more probability of carrying out a united action and policy at the next general election if you were governed by such an executive rather than by an executive which if chosen by the branches locally must consist for all practical purposes of members of the london branches and i do think looking at the whole question from a desire to see the enormous forces which are in the possession of irishmen in great britain utilised for the good and advantage of ireland i do think that you would make no mistake and that you would probably be satisfied if you adopted a resolution upon the lines proposed by mr lydon listening therefore to this discussion i have thought it better to put into shape what seems to me to be the almost unanimous wish of the convention and to suggest that if mr lydon and the other gentlemen who have proposed resolutions would withdraw them this resolution might be accepted that article of the constitution be repealed and that the following be adopted in its stead the affairs of the league shall be managed by a central executive consisting of a president vice president treasurer secretary and three other members to be elected at the annual convention if you decide upon adopting this resolution you will have decided that your executive shall consist of seven members the constitution or personality of that executive would of course have to come for consideration under a subsequent resolution when you can settle whether it should consist members of the irish parliamentary party or a mixed executive as at present applause mr lydon expressed his readiness to adopt this resolution the proposers of the various amendments then in turn withdrew their amendments and amid loud applause mr parnell resolution was carried mr parnell then moved that the following gentlemen shall form the executive for the coming year president mr thomas power o'connor mp vice president mr j g biggar mp secretary mr j e redmond mp treasurer mr j j o'kelly mp messrs justin mccarthy mp thomas sexton mp and t m healy mp members of the executive

      "mr parnell m p rose at twenty minutes to he was received with great cheering the whole assembly rising and greeting him with the strongest enthusiasm again and again the cheers were renewed and it was almost four minutes before mr parnell could commence his speech he said my lord mayor ladies and gentlemen i do not know how adequately to express my feelings with regard not only to your lordship address not only to the address of the parnell national tribute but also regarding this magnificent demonstration for i can call it nothing else but my lord i prefer to leave to the historian the description of to night and the expression of an opinion as regards the results which to night must produce hear hear you my lord have recalled to our memories the historical occasion of the assemblage years ago in this hall i trust that those who come after us i not only trust but i feel sure that those who come after us at the centennial anniversary of to day will occupy a brighter a higher and a greater position and will see their country occupy a greater and a higher position than we are fated to see to day cheers i shall not attempt to reply in any way to your lordship eulogy speaking as an irishman to an assembly of irishmen and irishwomen applause i shall only say that i believe and i think that the result of the great movement of the last few years shows that i am right in that belief cheers that there must have been many irishmen who thought and felt as i did many undoubtedly more able and more willing than i was no no to give effect to my thoughts and my wishes as an irishman i have no doubt in common with many thousands of my countrymen i looked around me i saw the artizan sic in the towns struggling for a precarious existence with a torpid trade with everything against him i saw the irish tenant farmer trembling before the eye of his landlord hear hear with the knowledge that in that landlord power rested the whole of the future of himself and of his family that his position was literally no better physically not so good as the lot of the south african negro hear hear that he was endeavouring to make both ends meet that his life was a constant struggle to keep the roof over his head and over the head of his family by the most grinding and pinching self denial i saw as you have all seen the irish labourer whose lot even to this day has been but very little improved hear hear but for whom there is now also i trust a ray of light and hope dawning cheers and cries of t p o'connor i saw the irish labourer the lowest of the low the slave of the slave with not even a dry roof over his head with the rain from heaven dripping upon the couch on which he was forced to lie dressed in rags subsisting upon the meanest food and whether i looked upon one side of the social system or upon the other side irresistible conviction was borne back upon me that here was a nation carrying on its life striving for existence striving for nationhood under such difficulties as had never beset any other people on the face of europe hear hear many of us saw these things to many of us these same thoughts occurred and some three years ago we resolved and i am proud and happy to say that at this board to night there are many present who joined in that resolve that these things should no longer be if we could help it and the historian of the future will say for the land league movement if he be unprejudiced and faithful that never was there a movement formed to contend against such an infamous and horrible system a system which even the british parliament and the influence and laws of england have already partially admitted to be a gigantic system of robbery and fraud cheers that never was there a movement formed to contend against such a system with so much odds against it in the carrying out of which i will not even say in connection with which but in association with which there was so much moderation and discretion and such an utter absence of crime and of the strong passions which agitate men cheers in which the closing words of the sentence were lost ireland is not in a normal condition if she had been we never should have had the system of landlordism that my friend mr davitt has devoted his life and vowed his future to the extermination of cheers we never should have had it and we certainly should not have it now were it not that this system is upheld by a stronger nation and a stronger power than our own we always have to take into account that no matter how we may strive to keep within the limits of the constitution this strong people outside of us and practically opposed to us will always meet us with the rule of force and in striving for and obtaining the partial justice that we have yet obtained we have been met with this rule of force look about you on every side you see over soldiers of the regular army retained in ireland you see another and more efficient army of policemen for same purpose you have seen the law the ancient law of habeas corpus italics repeatedly thrown away in regard to ireland and the most signal example of this particular breach of the constitution our of many breaches which are being constantly made in the british constitution in ireland laughter was when one thousand irishmen were thrown into prison by the late lamented buckshot forster groans and laughter we are now living under a coercion which is the combined result of the irish question and statesmen of england groans well gentlemen in face of all this in face of the fact that no man life much less his liberty is at the present moment safe lord hartington has the coolness to tell us that the liberal party will co operate with the irish party laughter a voice if he gets a chance mr parnell when we abandon our unconstitutional ways and use only constitutional methods laughter i would rather have preferred to say that until the liberal party abandon their unconstitutional methods and betake themselves to the observance of even the british constitution there can be no co operation between english liberals and irishmen cheers in respect to those matters connected with the advancement of popular liberties and the progress of general reform to which such co operation would be fairly permissible under normal conditions loud cheers to enable such a co operation and i don't know whether such co operation will ever take place it does not look likely at the present moment i must confess to enable such co operation as would be consistent and permissible with our present position as an independent irish party there must be no more coercion and there must be no more emigration loud and continued cheers we regard any system of emigration which has yet been tried in this country as a murderous blow loud cheers against the life of our nation renewed cheers accompanied by untold sufferings to the unhappy individuals on whom the experiment is made cheers it is useless for the tuke committee to present us with their carefully selected cases of certain individuals who have been prosperous in their new home beyond the atlantic we know enough from better experience what must be the fate of the unfortunate man who has emigrated with his family at the rate of per head including the passage money hear hear and we have irresistible proof to show that three fourths of the emigrants who have been sent out from ireland during the last year or two have been compelled to find their homes in the miserable garrets of new york boston and montreal cheers whatever mr tuke individual motives may be and he may be a philanthropist of the purest water for all i know the proceedings of his committee stand exposed as an indecent attempt to assist the government to get rid of the irish difficulty by getting rid of the irish people and to shield them from the responsibility which rightly belonged to them of providing for the welfare of the irish people so long as they insist upon the right of governing us we can hold no parley with emigrationists sic or coercionists applause if we are to be emigrated and coerced we prefer to have the dose administered by our natural enemies the tories hear hear rather than by those wolves in sheep clothing the whigs hisses if emigration must be tried if it is such a wonderfully good thing for the poor people why should they not try it upon some of those congested districts in london applause if i mistake not any attempt to bring into practical operation the theories of lord spencer and lord derby hisses with regard to emigration would lead and by the way we never heard of lord spencer hisses carrying any child out of the slums of st giles on board an emigrant ship in the thames any such attempt i say upon their part would lead to the opening up of questions and the suggestion of principles by no means palatable to the landed proprietors of england hear hear now gentlemen we have not arrived at our present position without having to submit to and to suffer a very great deal it is the history of every measure of reform of every advance for public liberties in ireland that it has to be accompanied by great suffering for the people by great sacrifices on the part of individuals and by relatively very small gain in proportion to the exertions which have been made who can doubt what would have happened to landlordism in ireland if any other european country was face to face with the movement of the last few years it would no longer have troubled us but we have in our country hard facts to meet with and to grapple with we have such individuals as lord spencer and mr trevelyan groans and i do not think i exaggerate when i say that although these two individuals have been vastly helped by the coercion act of which they have made such liberal use i do not think i exaggerate when i say that the present irish executive is probably characterised by greater meanness and by greater incapacity hear hear than any other of its predecessors that it is certain just as certain as that our poor friend mr forster groans and laughter was obliged to retire precipitately from this country or rather was not allowed to come back to erin laughter that it is just as certain that this present government of ireland will prove sooner or later and probably much sooner than later as great and as conspicuous a failure as any of its predecessors applause for lord spencer there is of course some excuse he does not owe his position to the fact that he has distinguished himself in the walks of literature laughter or to the fact that he is even a representative of the people renewed laughter he has been distinguished by none of those qualities which go to make a statesman laughter he simply came over to ireland as the assistant of mr forster groans and it is most desirable since it is so often dinned into our ears about the mingled gentleness and firmness i think that is the expression laughter of lord spencer it is most desirable that we should always remember that we should never forget that the present lord lieutenant of ireland simply came over as a very inferior bottle holder to mr forster loud and prolonged applause it was therefore to be expected that lord spencer should distinguish himself by the administration of the new coercion act by his refusal to spare that pillar of english rule in ireland mr marwood from any of the duties of his office hisses by his imprisonment and his tortures by his fines and police quartered upon an unoffending and guiltless people we are not surprised i say that lord spencer should do his little best to imitate the biggest of the big coercionists who ever came to ireland and that he should desire to give full play to the unbridled insolence and passion of the foreign garrison in ireland applause but what can we say of mr trevelyan groans a distinguished radical the good nephew of his great grand uncle laughter mr forster used to have a trick of overwhelming us all by saying that his great ambition was to enable everybody in ireland to do what they had a legal right to do laughter but mr trevelyan great ambition seemed to be to prevent anybody in ireland from doing what they had a legal right to do laughter and prolonged cheers take for instance three salient examples of mr trevelyan in ireland his imprisonment of my honourable friend mr harrington hear hear his seizure of the kerry sentinel italics and his imprisonment of the editor and lastly his suppression by proclamation of the national meeting in the north of ireland because recollect he has endorsed you might think that the lord lieutenant has done these things but mr trevelyan has endorsed them all in the first example mr harrington a simple young creature laughter thought that he might tell some of his tenant farmer constituents that if they did not do something for the labourers the irish members in the house of commons would stop exerting themselves for the purpose of amending the act by the admission of leaseholders within the land act the amendment of the healy clause and soforth sic mr harrington of course has a perfectly legal right to do this over in westminster but he had not a legal right to tell his constituents in ireland that he was going to do it in westminster and accordingly he was put into prison and he was taught on the plank bed that although he might have a legal right in westminster he had no legal right at all in ireland hear hear take the second example the proceedings in reference to the suppression of the kerry sentinel italics mr harrington brother was engaged in the perfectly legal occupation of bringing out a country newspaper a country weekly newspaper it was not a newspaper that had set any large portion of the west of ireland on fire i am not aware that he had set even a large portion of the county kerry on fire at all events mr harrington brother had been engaged in bringing out this weekly newspaper for twenty months during the existence of mr forster coercion act without ever having been reasonably suspected of a single thing laughter ah yes but mr trevelyan was going to change all that he knew better he knew that the brothers harrington were very dangerous men applause and one day when the printer devil who had by some misfortune got into mr harrington employment took it into his head to beguile an idle hour by snatching a proof purporting to be invincible notices from mr harrington type the great excuse was framed and the printing press of the kerry sentinel italics was seized the type was destroyed the newspaper was suppressed they were all sent off to dublin castle the boy admitted that he had done this thing and without the knowledge of the editor or of any responsible person about the place the notice in question presented all the internal and external evidence of want of genuineness and want of authenticity no child even would have said for a moment that it really was what it purported to be as well might you flog the schoolmaster because an idle schoolboy drew a picture upon his slate but mr harrington was made to suffer in person and in property for the fault of the boy in his employment and as we are sitting around this banquet board i think no greater example in a small way can be found of the utter unscrupulousness of our rulers of their utter want of common interest applause than the fact that mr harrington is still detained as a common felon within a prison walls lying on a prison bed and eating prison fare shame for an offence of which it must be perfectly well known to these men in dublin castle that he is as absolutely innocent as i am applause a voice we will have revenge mr parnell my friend says we will have revenge all i can say is that he will have to have lots of patience before he has his revenge i now come to the last example of this most pernicious and extraordinary government the suppression of the northern meetings mr trevelyan may be able to cross the water and hoodwink the simple people of galashiels but he is not going to throw dust on any section of the irish people either irish nationalists or irish orangemen cheers and i can hardly believe that what he told them hear hear all through his speech it is easy to detect the self satisfied chuckle of the man who exaggerates for his own purpose the danger likely to arise from the action of a few poor wretched orangemen and who deliberately exaggerates for the same purpose the resources for mischief of the landlords who hire them cheers he admits the illegality of these proceedings from the top to the bottom he describes them in the most forcible language while he enormously magnifies the results likely to arise to them cheers and what is his excuse for the action of the government an action you must remember exactly in accord with the wishes and demands of the law breakers his excuse was that it would take infantry and cavalry to protect the constitutional right of public meeting and enable those seeking an alteration in the law to do what they had a legal right to do if nationalists meet together to obtain an alteration of the land act if my lord mayor goes to derry to deliver a lecture cheers on the extension of the franchise to ireland the excuse for proclaiming the meeting in the one case and for at best winking at the designs of the assassins who fired at him was that it would take infantry and cavalry to do anything else did the government hesitate to protect the lough mask expedition in because it took infantry and cavalry to protect them did they ever refuse protection to any landlord engaged in the eviction of his tenants or to any sheriff engaged in forestalling the land act by selling out the interest of the tenant did the english government was it ever known to refuse all the arms and all the men that might be necessary for such a purpose no did the government in prison for twelve long months in and lest any impediment would be offered to the legal rights of the landlord class no all our experience of english force in ireland results in this that they are always willing to employ that force to the fullest extent while it is a question of protecting the so called rights of the minority against the majority cheers the proceedings in the north teach us this lesson that the law in ireland is only powerful when the minority applies for protection it is then quick to strike is very vengeful and unmerciful but when after great struggling it may happen that a statue of beneficial import to the people of ireland survives in a mutilated condition the two houses of parliament we find that statute is slow halting and ineffectual and until the english liberals and radicals learn the first lesson of their political creed that ever nation every country has a right to be governed according to the will of the majority of that country they will fail as they have always failed in their self imposed task of governing the irish people cheers gentlemen we are told about the franchise the liberal party is going we hear to extend the franchise to ireland i am very much inclined to believe that were it not that there exists in the house of commons a solid band of solid men cheers who would vote steadily against any extension of the suffrage in england if ireland were left out we would see very little of the inclusion of ireland in the forthcoming bill we can survey these contests between the english parties with perfect equanimity our position is a strong and a winning one whether they extend the franchise to ireland or not we will return i believe between seventy or eighty members cheers our cause is undoubtedly a winning cause and though the progress we may be making at present in the face of coercion must be slow yet still we are progressing we are keeping up and even adding to the impetus that was given to the national cause in the days of the irish national land league movement and although it is hard although ones blood often boils at witnessing the indignities and suffering and persecutions which the people of this country are obliged to submit to every day and night we must be patient we shall win if we are patient cheers the miserable character of the shifts and evasions which the irish executive have daily resorted to show that we must win cheers coercion cannot last for ever cheers and there is one thing to be said as this coercion act is running out and as we are living it down there is one thing we must remember and remind the english people of namely that if there is one fact more certain than another it is that if we are to be coerced even if the present coercion act or any part of it is to be renewed if the constitution is not to be restored to us these things shall carry with them in the shape of increased taxation the fruits and penalties inflicted upon us beyond a shadow of a doubt it will be for the irish people in england poorly as they are supported and isolated as they are and for your independent members to determine at the next general election whether the tory or liberal ministries shall rule england this is a great force and a great power if we may not rule ourselves we can at least cause them to be ruled as we choose cheers this force has already gained for ireland inclusion in the coming franchise bill and we have reason to be proud hopeful and energetic determined that this generation shall not pass away until it has bequeathed to those who come after us the great birthright of national independence and prosperity loud cheers mr parnell rising again proposed the health of the lord mayor he said i have had the honour and pleasure of the acquaintance of the lord mayor for many years i have watched his progress in public life and i have never ceased to felicitate ireland and myself that we were fortunate enough to have in the chair of the chief magistrate of ireland such a man as the present lord mayor cheers a gentleman of moderate politics the lord mayor can bind a firm and unyielding devotion to principle hear hear of unequal courage he withstood all the fascinations and influences of the viceregal court cheers he was neither ashamed nor afraid but he was proud to take his stand by his country when she was in trouble and by his countrymen when they were in prison i cannot express to you the magnitude of the services of the right hon the lord mayor it would be utterly impossible for me with my feeble powers of speech to tell you that i think regarding the importance of the fact that we have had him to fill the chair of the dublin mayoralty he has encouraged the irish municipalities to enter upon a new future he has shown them the importance and the weight and the power which they undoubtedly possess he has stimulated the corporations and the town commissioners in every part of ireland to claim for the majority of the people their due share in the management of their local affairs and i cannot doubt that to the dignity which he has added to the mayor chair in dublin to the lustre which he has shed over the great office which he holds will be due very much of the success which we hope to obtain in the near future of local self government and municipal privileges in ireland cheers contrast the position of the dublin corporation to day with what it was even in the memory of many of us no such change could have been expected in so short a time undoubtedly the power of national self government and the capacity of a nation to govern itself springs from the perfection of local and municipal institutions the lord mayor has always shown himself alive to the means of securing the suffrage for the people in order that the franchise which in cork is only exercise by persons rated at and in other cities is equally restricted may be extended to what it is in england i trust though i fear that we never can have another lord mayor like the present occupant of the chair i trust and believe and feel certain that his successor will happily and gallantly carry the banner which he hands to him and that he will not allow those traditions and those principles to deteriorate or to be tarnished i have great pleasure in asking you to drink the health of our gallant lord mayor cheers\n",

and mr trevelyan groans and i do not think i exaggerate when i say that although these individuals have been vastly helped by the coercion act of which they have made such ample use i do not think i exaggerate when i say that the irish executive is probably characterized by greater meanness by greater incapacity than any other of its predecessors and that it is certain just as certain as when our poor friend mr forster was obliged to retire groans precipitately from this country or rather was not allowed to come back to erin that this present government in ireland will prove sooner or later and probably rather sooner than later as great and as conspicuous a failure as any of its predecessors for spencer there is of course some excuse he does not owe his position to the fact that he has distinguished himself in the walks of literature laughter to the fact that he is even a representative of the people or to the fact that he has been distinguished by any of those qualities which go to make a statesman hear hear he simply came over to ireland as an assistant to mr forster and it is most desirable since we hear so much about his mingled gentleness and firmness i think that is the usual phrase about lord spencer it is most desirable that we should always remember that the present lord lieutenant came over here as a sort of inferior bottle holder to mr forster hear hear it was therefore to be expected that lord spencer would distinguish himself by the administration of the new coercion act by a stern refusal to spare that pillar of english rule in ireland mr marwood any of the duties of his office by his imprisonment and his tortures and by his police quarterings upon an unoffending and guiltless peasantry we are not surprised i say that lord spencer should do his little best to imitate the biggest of the big coercionists who have ever come to ireland and that he should desire to give full play to the unbridled insults and passions of the foreign garrison in ireland but what cane we say of mr trevelyan the distinguished and good nephew of his great grand uncle mr forster used to have trick of overwhelming us by saying that his great ambition was to enable everybody in ireland to do what they had a legal right to do ironical cheers but mr trevelyan great ambition seems to be to prevent anybody in ireland from doing what he has a legal right to do take for instance as an example the salient features of mr trevelyan rule in ireland his imprisonment of my honourable friend mr harrington his seizure of the kerry sentinel italics his imprisonment of the editor and lastly his suppression by proclamation of the national meetings in the north of ireland mr harrington thought he might tell some of his tenant farmer constituents that if they did not do something for the labourers the irish members in the house of commons would cease to exert themselves for the admission of leaseholders within the land act the amendment of the healy clause and so forth mr harrington of course had a perfect legal right to tell his constituents in ireland that he was going to do this in westminster and accordingly he was put into prison and he was taught on a plank bed that although he might have a legal right in westminster he had no legal right at all in ireland cheers take the second example the proceedings in reference to the suppression of the kerry sentinel italics mr harrington brother was engaged in the perfectly legal occupation of bringing out a country newspaper a country weekly newspaper it was not even suggested that this paper had set any large portion of the west on fire and i am not aware that it had even set any large portion of the county of kerry on fire at all events mr harrington brother was engaged in bringing out this weekly newspaper for months during the existence of forster coercion act without ever having been reasonably suspected of a single thing but mr trevelyan was going to change all that he knew that the brothers harrington were very dangerous men laughter and one day when a printer devil laughter who had by some misfortune got into mr harrington employment took it into his head to beguile an idle hour by snatching what purported to be an invincible notice from mr harrington type the great excuse was found the printing press of the kerry sentinel italics was seized the type was seized the newspaper was seized and they were all sent up to dublin castle the boy admitted he had done this thing without the knowledge of the editor or of any responsible person about the place the notice in question presented all the internal and external evidence of want of authority no child even would have said for a moment that it really was what it purported to be as well might you flog a schoolmaster because an idle schoolboy drew an idle picture on his slate hear hear but mr harrington was made to suffer in person and in property for the fault of that boy and as we stand round this banquet board i think no greater example in a small way could be given as to the utter unscrupulousness of our rulers and their want of common honesty loud cries of hear hear than the fact that mr harrington is still retained as a common felon wearing prison clothes lying in a prison bed and eating prison fare for an offence of which as it must be perfectly well known to those men in dublin castle he is as absolutely innocent as i am loud cheers and a voice we will have our revenge a gentleman says we will have our revenge i just wish to tell him that he will have to show much patience before he gets his revenge i come now to my last example of this most pernicious and extraordinary government the suppression of the northern meetings mr trevelyan may be able across the water to hoodwink the simple people of galashiels but he is not going to throw dust into the eyes of any section of the irish people neither irish orangemen nor irish nationalists will believe that mr trevelyan does himself the honour of believing what he has told the people of galashiels all through his speech there it is easy to detect the self satisfied chuckle of the man who exaggerates for his own purpose the danger likely to arise from the action of a few wretched orangemen hear hear and who deliberately apply for the same purposes the resources for mischief at the disposal of the landlords who hire them he admits the illegality of their proceedings from top to bottom he describes them in most forcible language while he enormously magnifies the results likely to arise from it and what is his excuse for the action of the government an action you must remember exactly in accord with the wishes and demands of the transgressors and law breakers his excuse was that it would take infantry and cavalry to protect the right of public meeting and to enable those seeking an alteration in the laws to do what they had a legal right to do cheers nationalists meet together for the purpose of obtaining an amendment of the land act or an alteration in any act of parliament if the lord mayor goes up to derry to deliver a lecture on the extension of the franchise to ireland the excuse for proclaiming the meeting in the one case and for winking at the proceedings of the assassins who fired at him cheers is that it would take a thousand infantry and cavalry to do anything else did the government hesitate to protect the lough mask expedition in because it took infantry and cavalry to protect them cheers did they every refuse protection to any landlord engaged in the extermination of his tenants to any engaged in forestalling the land act by selling out the interest of the tenants cheers was the english government ever known to refuse all the men all the arms and all the money that might be necessary for such protection never did the government shrink from holding untried men in prison for months in and lest any impediment should be offered to the legal rights of the landlord class cheers no all our experience of english force in ireland results in this conclusion that they are always willing to employ the force to the fullest extent and at every risk to the masses of the people where it is a question of protecting the so called rights of the minority against the majority cheers but when it comes to extending the protection of the law the forces at the disposal of the law to the majority against the minority in the assertion of their legal rights then we find abundant excuses and abundant reasons in the minds of our english rulers for evading their legal and their just obligations loud cheers the proceedings in the north teach once more the oft taught lesson that the law in ireland is only powerful where the minority appeals to its protection it is then quick to strike vengefully and unmercifully loud cheers but where it may happen that a statute survives a statute of beneficial import to the people of ireland survives even in a mutilated condition the two houses of parliament find that the operation of the law in putting in force that statute is slow and ineffectual hear hear and until english statesmen learn english liberals and english radicals learn the first lesson of their political creed that every nation that every country has a right to be governed according to the law of the majority of that country cheers they will fail as they have always failed in their task of governing the irish people gentlemen we are told about the franchise that the liberal party is going to be great and generous and going to extend the franchise to ireland i am very much inclined to think that were it not for the fact that there exists in the house of commons a solid band of men who would vote steadily against any extension of the suffrage in england if ireland were left out we should see very little of the inclusion of ireland in the bill cheers we can survey these questions and contests of english parties with perfect equanimity our position is a strong and a winning one in any case whether they extend the franchise or whether they do not we shall return between and members in the next election loud cheers our cause is undoubtedly a winning cause hear hear and though the progress we may be making at present and in the face of coercion must be slow yet still we are making progress we are making up the force and adding to the impetus which was given to the irish national cause in the days of the great land league movement cheers and although it is hard although our blood often boils in witnessing the indignities the sufferings and the persecutions which many of the people of this country are obliged to submit to by day and by night hear hear we must be patient we have every reason to be patient we shall win if we are patient the miserable character of the shifts and evasions which the irish executive has daily resorted to show that we are winning coercion cannot last for ever cries of no this coercion act is running out and we are living it down there is one thing that it is very well for us to remember and to remind english people of that if there be one fact more certain than another it is that if we are to be coerced again if the present coercion act or any part of it is to be renewed if the constitution is to be restored to us these things shall be done by a tory government and not by a liberal government cheers and shall carry with them in the shape of increased taxes and foreign wars penalties in excess of those inflicted upon us beyond a shadow of doubt it will be for the irish people in england separated isolated as they are and for your independent irish members to determine at the next general election whether a tory or a liberal ministry shall rule england cheers this is a great force and a great power if we cannot rule ourselves we can at least cause them to be ruled as we choose great laughter and cheering this force has already gained for ireland inclusion in the coming franchise bill we have reason to be proud hopeful and energetic determined that this generation shall not pass away until it has bequeathed to those who come after us the great birthright of national independence and prosperity great cheering amid which the hon gentlemen sat down\n",

      "before proceeding to move the amendment of which i have given notice i may be permitted to say that it would have been exceedingly convenient for us to have had more detailed information as to the measures of coercion which the government propose to introduce for ireland we are speaking to a certain extent in the dark and i could have wished that the prime minister had extended the scope of his observations and have given us the same information in regard to coercion as he did with respect to the proposed land bill in the absence of such information we must do the best we can but i trust the chief secretary will be able to inform us this evening of the general nature of the measures of coercion which he proposes i want to assume at the outset that there are many members of this house and i hope the result may prove that it is the majority who are desirous of being informed on the question of alleged agrarian crime and outrage and are desirous of giving fair play to ireland in looking at it in this point of view i think it is our duty to do all we can to remove the prejudices the misconceptions which have arisen with regard to the state of affairs in ireland i have occasionally come over to this country since parliament last met and i have been myself alarmed by reading the english newspapers and i have almost at times been tempted to think that some sudden change had arisen in ireland during the few days of my stay here and that instead of a state of disturbance and outrage below the normal condition of the last or years as i shall prove by statistics some extraordinary epidemic of crime had arisen there i am not at all surprised that englishmen and foreigners should have been led away by the deliberate conspiracy which the press of this metropolis has set on foot against the good name of ireland i do not mean to say that many things have not occurred in ireland which we must deplore but unhappily things have always occurred which we must deplore this conspiracy on the part of the guides of public opinion in england is a very hard thing for us to meet we have not usually the opportunity of appearing on your platforms and of speaking to large english audiences and when we find ourselves face to face with a persistent and repeated attempt to mislead public opinion with regard to ireland it almost makes one despair of demonstrating the real truth the difference between public opinion in england and ireland is really the clue to this our people understood thoroughly their own wants and wishes when we set on foot an agitation to carry certain reforms if that agitation was proceeding in england the english people would be well acquainted with it but because it takes place in ireland an opportunity was afforded for the grossest misrepresentation and it becomes almost impossible to set public opinion right i was glad that the prime minister said that there had been considerable exaggeration of the actual amount of crime in ireland and that he did not base his claim for exceptional legislation entirely on the existence of outrages but rather on the difficulty of obtaining convictions against persons of getting evidence perhaps i might before going further quote the object and explain the purposes of the irish national land league in doing so i shall not in any way prejudice the trials which are now proceeding adverting to these trials i may say in passing that this is the first jury which has ever been empanelled to try a political cause in ireland which the crown has not succeeded in packing the objects of the league are very simple 1st to prevent rack renting 2nd to enable tenants to become owners of their own farms by paying a fair rent for a limited number of years 3rd to facilitate the working of the bright clauses of the land act those are the objects which we have been working to bring to a successful issue hon members will admit that there is nothing so very dreadful in those objects but they may say we have sought to carry out those objects by improper means that we have incited to outrage or if we have refrained from outrage we have not sufficiently reprobated it i can only say that for my part i think at every meeting at which i spoke in ireland up to the time when the chief secretary sent extra constabulary into the starving localities of galway and mayo that i took care to reprobate outrage and to point out that we did not wish outrage but we wished to act in a peaceful and constitutional manner the other prominent members of the league acted in the same manner and even exceeded me in the vehemence with which they denounced it my friend mr davitt immediately on his return from america pointed out that nothing would so much go against our cause as the commission of outrages and although some members belonging to the league may have said incautions foolish and hasty expressions calculated to mislead the people to whom they were addressed yet i believe such occurrences were very exceptional and wherever they did occur the speakers were always reproved for their incautiousness and took care to remedy it the course the land league recommended was agitation by means of public meetings throughout the country that the people should be recommended to organize themselves to unite together and to refuse to pay more than a fair rent and to refuse also to take farms from which another tenant had been evicted in consequence of inability or refusal to pay more than a fair rent some of the apparent accompaniments of that agitation are very much to be deplored but the agitation has consisted up to the present time of something like land meetings attended by crowds unprecedented in number since the time of o'connell undoubtedly the heart of the irish people has been stirred in a way that has not occurred before in our generation and the fact that although excited and just emerged from a state of famine during which the landlords took the opportunity to carry out evictions in an unprecedented manner the facts as seen in a return laid on the table last night show that the number of outrages is below the averages during the years comprised in the return is a striking testimony to general peace and tranquillity of the country during the first six months of the year the landlords took advantage of the opportunity which distress and famine afforded them in many parts of ireland to execute ejectments against heads of families involving probably persons of these were re admitted as tenants and as care takers are we not entitled to assume that very much of the sudden increase of the crime during the four months which elapsed since the summer assizes arose from an attempt on the part of the landlords to turn out the people who had been admitted as care takers and whom they could eject by a summary process which required neither notice to quit or to bring persons before a court of quarter sessions the amount and character of the crime has also been enormously exaggerated the chief secretary stated to night that the number of agrarian outrages in was and of these nearly half were threatening letters letters of that kind are very common i believe the people often write them to themselves and a country should not get a bad name because of such letters if a country in which such letters are prevalent deservers a bad character england is certainly worthy of blame for numberless letters containing threats are sent to me and other members of the land league from this country i received a number of them to day but of course nobody in his senses takes any notice of them the man who writes a threatening letter is not the man to act up to his words in cases out of he is too great a coward the other day i was travelling to london and a man who sat beside me but did not know me said i tell you what ought to be done to that parnell he ought to be shot for the way in which he shoots the landlords in ireland i am sure the prime minister would have been surprised if i had applied for protection when travelling on the north western threatening letters no doubt are foolish and wrong but i do not think they should be taken much notice of well i find by the returns just issued that the average number of outrages reported by the constabulary since the year including the year amount to per annum in the number of outrages reported to the constabulary only amounted to compare this with the year when the number was or the year when the number was or with the year when the number was or with when it was or with when the number was and you will see i can fairly claim that the year with outrages only is at all events among years of peace and order in ireland the year is a favourable one to compare with we had not then the distress and therefore there was the less cause i will not say reason for outrage than to day was one of the years chosen by the english minister of the day for bringing forward coercion we find in that year there were agrarian outrages of which were threatening letters or about half in there were only ejectments in the year there were ejectments if that ratio had been kept up it would have given us ejectments instead of in but owning to the action of the irish national land league they only amounted to for the first half of the year thus leaving only for the six months during which the league had got into operation after the failure of the chief secretary and the house of commons to deal with the question we find in those two years that the ratio of agrarian crime of ejectments was 2½ to while in a year of unprecedented agitation following a year of famine the ratio was something like of agrarian crime to 1½ of ejectments in other words there was 2½ times as much as agrarian crime in in proportion to the ejectments as there was in but if i compare the year with and other years i find a still more remarkable difference and i will ask hon members to mark well those figures we find there is an enormous improvement in these days as compared with those old times in and following years when the tithe agitation was in full swing the tithe agitation was an agitation of a very similar character to the present anti rent war agitation it was an agitation directed by o'connell for the purpose of preventing the people from the necessity of paying about towards the income of the late english establishment in ireland that was a smaller sum of money the people were agitated in very much the same way but they were not organized the anti rent movement of the present day is directed to prevent the people from the necessity of paying about or in the year so that you will see that there is about five times the amount of money in question in these days that sic there was in question in now what do we find with regard to we find that petitions were sent in to the house of lords complaining that there existed in ireland a systematic opposition to the payment of tithe just as they complain to day that there exists a systematic opposition to the payment of rent which i deny i admit there is a systematic opposition to the payment of rent which i deny i admit there is a systematic opposition to the payment of more than a fair rent and the people have taken the poor law valuation as the most convenient standard of what a fair rent ought to be but i deny that there is a systematic opposition to the payment of all rents and that it was impossible to collect them without having recourse to the aid of constabulary this systematic opposition took the form of organized intimidation just as they complain to day and we are told that the government found it necessary to introduce a bill to prevent and punish this rising by what they called the whiteboy act but we have got the whiteboy act in full force to day and the act which was put in force to repress the tithe rent agitation is in full swing in ireland at the present moment the act though it repeals the punishment of death in certain cases was nevertheless a penal statute you ask for exceptional powers and i dare say a great many in this house hardly know the extreme stringency of the exceptional measures that already exist in ireland in the shape of the whiteboy act but in spite of this whiteboy act the agitation against tithes increased in violence and extent as every agitation in ireland will increase in spite of any coercive measures this house may think proper to pass until the cause of the agitation has been removed in kilkenny during that period there were as stated by mr stanley in the debate on the address in murders and attempts at murder burnings of houses assaults of a dangerous character contrast the condition of kilkenny as depicted by mr stanley with the condition of the kilkenny of the present day or rather i will say contrast one of the worst provinces in ireland so far as the commission of outrages the province of munster contrast the whole province of munster with the condition of that day i have not given the contrast from judge fitzgerald charge with regard to the condition of munster i regret exceedingly that judge fitzgerald charge has been relied upon as a reason for coercion yet this is the state of munster consisting of four counties clare limerick kerry and cork cork being as the house is aware the largest county in ireland threatening letters shooting into houses and malicious injuries maiming cattle arson therefore taking the whole province of munster the worst province in the point of outrages in ireland is not so bad to day as the county of kilkenny in in ireland which has unfortunately an unhappy history the people have been driven to rely too much upon murder and outrage for the redress of their grievances and to feel there is nothing to keep them in their homes but the fear that may be inspired by threatening letters or the shooting of landlords or agents or the burning of some of their outhouses or haystacks and the politician who attempts to originate a movement in ireland might do so with the knowledge that there will be crime and outrage wherever there is disturbance and eviction and that he will be accused and made responsible for the result of the unhappy history of the country in which he has organized this movement as i have been in the present instance i have not been able to do away with the usual condition i wish it had been otherwise but there is an enormous improvement i have shown you that as compared with the number of evictions the statistics of crim show that there had been in two and a half times as much agrarian outrages and crime as we have now in and recollect that this was a time when there was no distress or famine when the people had not come through a terrible year of misfortune and oppression and when there was no agitation or organization i claim for the organization that it has been most effectual in preventing crime in ireland i feel convinced that if it had not been for our exertions the ratio of evictions which commenced in the first half of at and odd would have gone increasing and that you should have murder and outrage on the scale of some of those unhappy years about which i have just quoted and i warn the government that if they attempt to put down constitutional rights in ireland if they take away from the people the right of meeting publicly and discussing their grievances if they prevent them from organizing if they prevent them bringing to bear the strong force of public opinion on individuals who defy the public opinion on individuals who defy the public opinion of their neighbours the will see murder and outrage walking abroad through the land notwithstanding all their constabulary and all their police and all their coercion acts they may strike down the leaders who are using their influence and i am thankful to say they have effectually used their influence to prevent crime and outrage up to the present moment if they do these things they will have murder and crime the landlords will be encouraged to evict and they will grind them down as they ground them down before the spirit that has been aroused in ireland will not be willing to submit to this tyranny and what i have stated will be the result i think it right to state what i know must happen even from the prospect of coercion as encouraging the landlords to evict we had yesterday as the ill omened accompaniments of the queen speech the news that the police had fatally injured two men in attempting to carry out an eviction or process serving and that several persons were seriously hurt this is the beginning of what we are going to have you may take away the arms from the people but never yet was an agrarian murder prevented in ireland for want of a blunderbuss to shoot the landlord now the choice that we have before us is this whether you will have open organization which undoubtedly has committed some mistakes whose action in some respects is open to blame and criticism i do not wish to deny for a moment this action is being very fast modified by experience and by advice in such a way as to make it exceptional whether you will have such an open organization or whether you will have a secret conspiracy secret conspiracies do not now exist in ireland i used to hear of the secret conspiracy of ribbonism a most powerful organization an organization which i have been informed had its head quarters in manchester but if you crush down the people with coercion the result must be that you will have ribbonism and kindred societies for the purpose of doing that by secret conspiracy which you prevent them from doing by open organization the majority of the inhabitants of ireland the agricultural labourers and farmers of ireland who constitute practically speaking with their wives and families out of the population or five sixths of the populace this class has been stirred in an unprecedented way they have been taught to rely upon open agitation and organization to rely upon combination amongst themselves and upon the force of public opinion to prevent persons from offending against the unwritten law of the majority of the people of ireland and when i say the unwritten law i wish to point out to you that the majority of the people of ireland do not make their laws themselves that they are made for them by a nation outside themselves entirely unacquainted with the wants and wishes of the people of that country the result is that if there are unjust laws of ireland are admitted to be the only way the people can protect themselves from them is by their own unwritten laws which they have striven to enforce and have successfully enforced so far up to the present occasion by the strong force of public opinion i agree that in a well ordered community existing under normal conditions responsible for its own prosperity with its representatives entirely responsible to those who elected them and no others and with power to do everything for themselves the invocation of public opinion against the law of the land would be a most criminal proceeding but i deny it is the case in ireland it has been at times recognized in every country which has not had the privilege of self government that resistance to unjust laws is sometimes legitimate and i can conceive no higher duty of patriotism on the part of the irish tenant than the willingness to go to gaol and suffer hard labour rather than surrender his right to feed his family and support them by the produce of the soil he tills we have undoubtedly called upon them to resist by organization and without violence and by passive resistance by refusing to take a farm from which another had been evicted by refusing to deal with the person who supplies him with provisions we have undoubtedly organized the people to resist in this way those unjust laws which are the result of the legislation of this house but the emergency was such that there was no other resource open to us we had been left defenceless after the close of last session by the rejection of the compensation for disturbance bill during the passing of the act i voted with the government on the second reading it was not until they had spoiled their bill by striking out a vital portion of it by the introduction of a limitation that i felt it to be my duty to walk out of the house and when it came to the third reading i also abstained from voting but so long as the bill remained in its original shape so long as it embraced the first intentions of the government i supported it and was willing to do that which would have undoubtedly very materially injured the agitation in ireland by facilitating the passing of the compensation for disturbance bill of last session mr speaker let me in conclusion give a very brief history of coercion for ireland from to nine different coercion measures were passed including three suspensions of the habeas corpus one martial law and five insurrection acts from to the present date different coercion measures including seven suspensions of the habeas corpus were passed by this house the government tell us that they cannot get evidence and that they want measures for the purpose of getting evidence this reminds me of the saying that one man can take a horse to the water and cannot make him drink it is not intimidation prevents witnesses coming forward and giving evidence it is not intimidation prevents the tenants from paying rent but it is the public opinion of the majority of the people i regret that some ground has been given for that charge of intimidation with regard to the payment of rent i regret that tenants have not yet sufficient moral courage to go to the landlord and say we won't pay you more than the government valuation because by doing so we believe we shall injure the settlement of the land question i regret that on the contrary many of the tenant farmers go and say if we paid more than the government valuation we should have our houses burned down our cattle houghed or ourselves injured but where is the intimidation the intimidation is on the part of the landlords to whom the tenant is afraid to speak the truth the intimidation is not on the part of the irish national land league it is simply because the poor wretched creatures many of them recollecting so much of their own unhappy history have not the moral courage to go to the landlord and tell him we won't pay you what we believe to be an unjust rent this question mr speaker is a question of saving or a year for the landlords of ireland and if the government succeed in passing a coercion bill it will be because they were driven to it by the landlords who desire to obtain this sum of money and not because there is any danger to life and the immediate sum in dispute amounts to or and the question on the part of the landlords is one of cupidity and a desire to reap that which they have not sown to get more than they are entitled to for their land the tenants think and rightly think in my opinion that it is enough for them to pay the poor law valuation that after they have made the lands what they are after they have reclaimed them from a state of nature they are justly entitled to some of the profits and they have fixed upon this griffith valuation as being that on the average which they can afford to pay it would amount to something like on the agricultural holdings in ireland the landlords claim something like and the government have been asked to introduce coercion for the purpose of putting into the pockets of the irish landlords instead of i ask is that a worthy use to make of a liberal party of unexampled strength and liberality that they should allow themselves immediately on coming into office to be made the catspaw of a minority over in ireland not even of a minority in your own country for a minority in your own country could not so hoodwink and blind you as to speak of force i entreat the house to pause before it plunges into the abyss before it and enacts coercion for ireland the right hon gentlemen at the head of the government had a chance of propitiating ireland he was nearer it than he thought he had perhaps the best chance of persuading the irish people that this house was desirous of making good and just laws for them but if he brandishes the weapon of coercion at these people the result will be that will make it still more impossible for him to do that he will never do it by coercion or terror he might have had a chance of relieving ireland by goodwill a generous a true and a noble policy but you have never been able to rule the irish people by terror and coercion and you never will be able to so rule them the hon member concluded by moving the amendment of which he had given notice amendment proposed at the end of paragraph to add the words but we humbly assure her majesty that we are convinced that the peace and tranquillity of ireland cannot be promoted by suspending any of the constitutional rights of the irish people mr parnell italics question proposed that those words be

law my police are five sixths of the irish people at home and abroad and if he is going to put them all into prison he will have to find a very big prison cheers he will have to find a prison big enough to hold twenty millions of people cheers and the unwritten law that he has to put down is the public opinion of the irish nation which is very fast becoming the public opinion of the whole

ireland cheers already we have three fourths of the french press on our side while only about a month ago much of it was against us a voice thanks to you cheers mr parnell already we have many of the state legislatures in america passing resolutions of sympathy with the irish nation and from every part all eyes are directed to you to see how you will bear the trial with which you are now face to face now the tenant farmers are the men to whom we look to day to display courage and if they do they can show their devotion by refusing to pay unjust rents that is not a very hard thing to ask you to do laughter and that is all we want you to do a voice we will do it cheers mr parnell and if you promise to do this we are willing to go to prison or anywhere else for your sake cheers a voice they tried to put you in but they could not cheers mr parnell the tenant farmers need not be afraid that they will be sent to prison themselves in the first place there are too many of them coercion does not mean coercion really it only means intimidation they will take up a man here or there through the country they will put him into prison in order to strike terror into the rest a voice it no use cheers mr parnell an organised people as the irish are to day cannot be intimidated cries of never and cheers i believe the tenant farmers will be equal to the occasion i am sure if it was only from a feeling of shame that they won't flinch to day cries of never and cheers the struggle will not be a long one you have already beaten landlordism to its knees cheers and although mr gladstone and mr forster groans may strive to resuscitate and revive for a little while this defeated foe of ireland you may depend upon it that the struggle will be a very short one and that if you stand firm before many months are gone by you will have landlordism down again cheers never to rise loud cheers a voice we were long waiting for you cheers mr parnell we may anticipate some evictions we may suppose that the landlords encouraged by by sic coercion will attempt to evict some of their tenants i don't myself think that the evictions will be very numerous but a practical piece of advice that i must give you would be this that where the landlord persists in evicting any tenant the tenant should call his neighbours in a few days before the eviction and plough up all the ground cheer and laughter and leave it with him in that condition they will then not be able to turn that condition they will then not be able to turn in catsle sic upon the lands to graze your fields cheers now as regards the land bill i have always expressed my belief that the present parliament and government would fail to settle the irish land question and the fact that they have placed coercion before their land bill shows that they do not entend sic to settle it and that they know they cannot settle it but whatever measure they may bring forward even although it may be very inadequate provided it passes it will put the tenant in a better position to continue the struggle against landlordism hear hear although it may not be a permanent settlement of the land question yet if it gives the tenant a legal defence against an ejectment i shall look upon it as something not to be refused or rejected while at the same time i shall take care to point out in what respect it must fail to be accepted as a final solution of this question hear hear and i believe that even an imperfect land measure might perhaps put the tenant farmers in a more confident position as regards their ability to maintain a firm grip on their holdings cheers and that they would not fight this battle with less courage and with less perseverance than they have shown in the past however we cannot say anything for certain with regard to the land bill until we see it i only thought it advisable to tell you to day what i have said on many other platforms that i believe that the land bill will fail to provide a permanent settlement of the irish land question a voice we will make them settle it and no thanks to them laughter mr parnell no land measure which does not reduce the rental of ireland will be acceptable to the irish tenant farmer never and the landlords will fight to the death before they will accept that as a solution so you see that it it sic necessary for you to continue your organisation to accept the land bill only as far as it may enable you to fight the battle against landlordism hear hear i go back to london where we have been fighting for you during the last six or seven weeks loud cheers we have been opposing the suspension of the habeas corpus act the last time the habeas corpus act was suspended in ireland was just fifteen years ago before you had an independent irish party hear hear and it only took them hours to carry that bill through the commons and the lords and to obtain the royal assent for it but we have changed all that and to day it takes them seven weeks to do that which fifteen years ago they were able to do in hours that is my answer to the men who say that we have not done our duty in opposing this bill cries of you have i say that in all my political life i shall look back with no greater satisfaction to any portion of it than to our opposition to the suspension of the habeas corpus act in ireland hear hear and to those who say that they would have done this or that we ought not to have done that i point to what happened years ago when their methods and their policy were followed and when the liberties of the irish people were stolen away in hours cheers they charge us with obstructing the business of the house of commons i say that that charge is a lie a voice a cheer for parnell cheers mr parnell no irish member attempted this session to obstruct the business of parliament we did attempt to prevent coercion for ireland and it was our duty to do so but mr gladstone and his government have entered into a deliberate conspiracy a voice to h with them and groans to prevent your representative from expressing their constitutional right in parliament hear hear i have not myself been permitted to speak yet upon this coercion bill i have only spoken once against the principle of coercion for about twenty minutes when i was moving an amendment to the address at the commencement of the session i have only been permitted by mr gladstone to plead the cause of my country for about twenty minutes of the time of parliament and yet i am to be told indeed that i am obstructing the business of parliament and that i am attempting by talking against time to prevent measures of importance for the country from being passed and now fellow countrymen i leave you with the utmost confidence that you will do your duty during the coming crisis cheers i am sure you will i ask you not to be afraid of coercion no no that weapon has already been broken even before it has been raised to strike i believe that the result of this last attempt at coercion will be the destruction of british misrule in ireland cheers i am confident that of all the mistakes and blunders which have been perpetrated by an english government in ireland no greater mistake has ever been made than the attempt to put down irish public opinion by coercion cheers the attempt could not have been made in england because the english people are a self governing people and they would have risen as one man against any attempt on the part of their rulers to coerce them but this ministry knows well that they have the power over us that they can keep us down in this country by the strong force at their disposal from outside and therefore they have been encouraged in this attempt at intimidation now if you meet this policy by a policy of passive resistance if you patiently suffer and endure anything that they put upon you if you avoid retaliation or the attempt to meet force by force if you stand by and encourage each other in your sufferings if you refuse to take farms from which your neighbours have been evicted if you refuse to pay unjust rents this measure of coercion will fall harmlessly upon you and will recoil on the heads of its authors with crushing effect cheers i entreat you then finally to be worthy of the occasion the eyes of the world are fixed upon you do not let it be said that this perhaps the last and the greatest struggle that ireland has ever made will fall short the sacrifices that you are asked for are not much your forefathers spilled their blood on many a field of battle hear hear step by step and inch by inch they contested the possession of this fair land of ireland with the myrmidons of henry and elizabeth and the troopers of cromwell cheers they then fought gallantly and were willing to make far more bitter sacrifices than you are called upon for to day will you be worse than they never will you show yourselves unworthy and degenerate sons of noble ancestors never to day the struggle which commenced so many centuries ago is continued and carried on by different means and with other weapons victory is almost shining on your banners cheers will you for want of a little courage a little determination to suffer and bear a little in silence will you fail when it is almost within your grasp never i am sure you will not renewed cries of never i am confident that you will be equal to the occasion and that in a very short time at the end of our battle we shall have the satisfaction of looking around us and of seeing the fair plains of green erin once more made free loud and prolonged cheering\n",

      "speaking to a large audience at the railway station he said that he had never seen such spirit exhibited anywhere as in the king county it seemed to be undoubted fact that as coercion was coming nearer the spirit of the people was mounting higher and higher cheers this was just as it should be and he did not think this beautiful government of ours knew exactly what it was about in fact he had never read in history of any english government which in its government of ireland knew exactly what it was about hear hear we had had a variety of chief secretaries with excellent intentions and a variety of promises but we always found that when they came over here and had been in this country a few years the atmosphere of dublin castle proved too much for their good intentions and made them forget their multitudinous promises and so it had been on the present occasion and the irish chief secretary had played into the hands of men like him mr parnell who believed in the right of the irish people to legislative independence and he had succeeded in thoroughly discrediting himself and the government to which he belonged cheers no english government could recover the blow they had themselves dealt english government in ireland during the last twelve months cries of down with buckshot forster those whom the gods wish to destroy they first deprive of their senses said an ancient proverb and it appeared to him that our unfortunate rulers and masters had been deprived of their senses and so placed themselves in a position to be destroyed politically speaking by the combined action of the irish people now he was as convinced as he was of his own existence that if the people did not flinch they would win this battle cheers beyond a doubt he believed the land of ireland would pass into their possession at a much less price than the landlords might have obtained for it if it were not for buckshot forster groans the settlement of the irish land question seemed to be so near at hand they would have very little else to do than stretch forth their hands and be saved the eternal verities of truth and justice were fighting on their side natural laws were in their favour cheers they had suffered in this country in a way that was only possible in a country held down by foreign rule force and bayonets but in these days of public opinion when their cause was watched by all the nations of the earth it was no longer possible for brute force to obtain the mastery hear hear failing the strength of brute force they are going to attempt intimidation prove superior to intimidation fear them not and trust me loud cheers that you will see as the result that we shall have gained the great cause of the freedom of irish land and taken the first step towards our national independence loud cheers\n",

      "i have to thank my friends for attending this meeting in such large numbers and i have also to apologise to you for giving you such very short notice i think it was only the day before yesterday that i was able to issue the circulars asking you to attend here this evening and i need not say that i feel additionally indebted to you that you did not allow the shortness of the notice to weigh against your attendance this is the first representative meeting of irishmen since the passing of the coercion act for ireland and i am glad to see my fellow countrymen in london have not lost heart i have attended a great many meetings in london and i think i never had the pleasure of attending a meeting of anything like the dimensions of the present one hear hear i have some letters of apology which i don't think it will be necessary for me to read as i shall hand them to the press now the object for which i have asked you to come together is the desirability of forming an organisation in england a sister organisation to that in ireland for the purpose of forwarding the objects of the irish national land league we don't intend in any respect to compete with the home rule confederation we do not propose to interfere in the slightest degree with the operations of the home rule confederation that organisation will still remain in existence and will still carry on its own proper work but a great many of my friends have pointed out to me from time to time that a field is open in england and in scotland for the purpose of disseminating the principles of the irish national land league a very important field and one which if properly worked would be of enormous assistance to our people in ireland in combating the misrepresentations to which they have been necessarily subjected in this great struggle for the land of ireland i probably may be asked whether the proposed organisation will take up the question of english land of course that we be a matter for discussion and anything that the meeting decides upon doing i shall be very happy to co operate in carrying out but my own opinion is that the english land question is not at present ripe for settlement and that it would be better to push on with the irish land question and to gain as many successes and ameliorations in the condition of the irish tenant farmers as we can and invite the co operation of the english working classes the english labour classes in this movement we feel sure that anything that will be done in ireland will also react upon the english question when it comes up for its settlement hear hear and now i should recommend that our organisation should be simply a sister organisation to the irish national land league acting independently self governed with its own code of rules and regulations for the purpose of assisting the operations of the league in ireland the struggle in which our people at home are engaged in an exceedingly severe one as must have been rendered evident to everybody who has watched the course of events during the last one or two years it is the first earnest attempt the first real attempt that has been made to settle the irish land question and in consequence the forces that are arrayed against us are very serious and very extensive i think that i perhaps may be able to bring the magnitude of the struggle home to your minds best by quoting the figures which are probably involved the annual rental payable by the tenants of ireland to the landlords amounts so far as we have been able to gather to about sixteen or seventeen millions of pounds sterling this very large sum is paid annually by the tenant farmers and by far the larger proportion of it goes out of the country either in the shape of rents to absentee landlords or in the shape of interest on mortgages on estates in ireland mortgages which are held by english capitalists and the interest of which necessarily comes to this country in fact i should suppose to this sum of seventeen millions of pounds sterling annually paid by the irish tenant farmers not more than two or three or four millions at the very outside remains in the country or comes back into the pockets of the people of ireland hear hear these figures will give you a notion of the magnitude of the interests that are involved and we leave you to appreciate the exertions which have been made on the other side for the purpose of blocking our cause and misrepresenting our cases to the people of england exertions which i am free to admit have been up to the present moment to a certain extent successful but exertions which i venture to hope with the assistance of the organisation which we propose to form in england will not be successful in the future hear hear the way of showing you the magnitude of the interests involved will be by capitalising this amount you are aware that under the bright clauses of the land act a tenant was allowed to become the purchaser of his holding by paying to the government five per cent for thirty five years upon the amount of the purchase money received by his landlord upon selling this sum of seventeen million pounds sterling which is annually paid by the tenants in the event of the purchase system proposed by mr bright being adopted would mean a total payment of millions of money for the purpose of enabling the tenant farmers of ireland to become the owners of their holdings i cannot give you a calculation of the amount which has been paid by the irish tenants in ireland since the first conquest of ireland rent which bear in mind has been paid for confiscated land for land the title to which depends upon force fraud and conquest cheers i should not like to name a sum but it would probably amount to something like four or five hundred million pounds sterling which has been drained out of the country during a number of years and which has not returned to ireland in any shape the rents of ireland have been going on increasing from year to year the value of irish land depends entirely upon the exertions of the irish tenants all the improvements have been made by the irish tenants none of them or scarcely any of them have been made by the landlords hear hear about twenty years ago an act was passed authorising the treasury to advance money at per cent to landlords to enable them to improve their estates during all the twenty years or so which have elapsed since the passing of this act the landlords have only borrowed about one or two million pounds sterling certainly it did not exceed two millions this sum will show you the very small amount of money which has been spent by irish landlords upon improving their own property in fact all the improvements in ireland have been done by the tenants hear hear and if we were to go back to the time when the land of ireland first passed into the possession of the present holders and to value the land at its then condition we should probably find that instead of the rental of the land being worth a rental of seventeen million a year it would probably be worth a rental of about one or two millions if we went upon mere principles of justice that is to say of giving only to the landlord that which he has put into the land by his own exertions the landlords would find that instead of being in receipt of a rental of seventeen millions a year they would be entitled to one or two million a year however we are only to accept things as they stand and we have to look to the most practical method of solving the land question and our object in the first place in ireland has been to reduce the rents in order to enable the tenants to purchase on a fair basis and after we have reduced the rents to arrange such a method of purchase that the difficulties which now present themselves in the shape of the value of entail and settlements may not prevent the rapid transfer of the land into the possession of the tenant farmers i should like to say one or two words about the irish land bill of course we don't know what it is going to be but so far as i have been able to think about the matter my notion has always been that we ought not to reject absolutely any proposals of an ameliorative character that may be made to us by the present government cheers i don't think it is possible for the present ministry to settle the irish land question even if they desired to do so hear hear and i do think that there are several men in the present ministry who are desirous of settling the question hear hear i would name amongst others perhaps it may be invidious to name them mr bright and mr chamberlain hear hear and there must be a great many of the english radicals in the house of commons who have no interest in maintaining the abominable system of oppression which exists in our country but when i look to the surroundings of the situation and when i see that the one or two or three men whom i have mentioned are swamped by a majority of the cabinet who are very much interested in the land from a territorial point of view when i see that the cabinet is composed mainly of men like the marquis of hartington of men like forster who has proved himself such a willing slave of the temporary and reactionary party in ireland i cannot as a sensible and reasonable number of whigs in the party with a following behind it in the house of commons sitting behind it can possible have any hope of settling the irish land question upon a permanent basis hear hear and when i say this i don't wish to keep that land question open hear hear i should rejoice if it was settled to morrow hear hear this question has always been a source of weakness to ireland and if it is not settled now it will continue i have no hesitation in saying to be a source of weakness to our country hear hear i think if we could settle the land question so as to put a stop once and for all to the struggle between the aristocracy in ireland and the labouring classes which has been going on for so long that the solution of the national question would be arrived at by natural means cheers i think we should have an arrangement in that case entered into between england and ireland by which ireland would be granted complete self government and management over her own international affairs cheers and i feel convinced that such an arrangement entered into in that way after the land question had been settled would not be the slightest injury to the english empire hear hear nay more that it would absolutely strengthen the power of england both at home and abroad in everything that is just and right nothing more hear hear but this land question i fear is not destined to be settled to day hear hear i should be very sorry to oppose the slightest concession to the tenant farmers of ireland hear hear history has taught us that masses of people are always anxious for some amelioration in their condition no matter how small the amelioration may be and that is the spirit i think in which we ought to approach the proposals of the government while taking care that it may not be said at any future time that we accepted such an incomplete measure as a final settlement of this very difficult irish land question hear hear now how can this organisation which we propose to set on foot help us in ireland i think you can do quite as much as your countrymen are doing in america to help in the solution of this question hear hear you can educate the english people and public opinion and in speaking of english public opinion i wish to recant some expressions which i formerly used in reference to english public opinion one or two years ago i said before the commencement of this land movement that irish politicians ought not to take into any account english public opinion because it was so difficult to reach i feared that it would be impossible for us ever to reach it in an effectual way i was apprehensive that we should not entertain any hope of cultivating english public opinion and instructing english public opinion in such a way as to enable us to counteract the exertions of the interested classes in ireland and england who use such strenuous exertions to spread false ideas with regard to our movement but what i meant then by english public opinion was the sort of public opinion you see in social circles in london hear hear the club public opinion the opinion which is reflected by metropolitan newspapers and by a great many of the provincial newspapers hear hear and i confess that my views have changed very much during the year or two which have gone by at that time we were endeavouring to cut our coat according to our cloth we had not then the very large resources which we are in possession of now for the purpose of originating a campaign in england hear hear we could not go then into the resources as we did lately during the passage of the coercion bill and hold a half dozen or a dozen public meetings in manufacturing centres throughout great britain and we were not able to do this then hear hear in the first place our party was very small in the house of commons it consisted of the mystic number of seven laughter we have now something like cheers we had then no valuable resources we have now our friends in america who are pouring in money at the rate of three or four thousand pounds a week cheers all these figures point to a very great difference in the prospects of irish agitation in england and the successful prosecution of our cause hear hear the great mass of the english people i feel convinced do not desire to do any injustice to ireland hear hear then again i was very much influenced by the advice and very strong recommendations which were given to me by my friend mr michael davitt hear hear i can recollect the day before he was arrested and sent back to penal servitude a conversation which he held with me he said to me i think we have made a great mistake in not cultivating the public opinion of the english working classes and i hope you will take steps in england he was then returning to ireland to hold meetings in the large english towns and to instruct the working classes with regard to the merits of this irish question he was arrested the next day and i have recollected that he told me that then and kept it in my mind and i think it was very important and very valuable advice hear hear now the english land question we can show them that they are being made the tools of the territorial party in this country and also in ireland for the purpose of collecting these seventeen millions a year in the shape of rents from ireland if we can show them that these operations and the collecting of unjust rents necessitates an annual payment from them of four millions of money at least for the purpose of maintaining forty thousand soldiers in ireland if we can show them that this is keeping the two countries permanently estranged that it makes the irishmen hate the englishmen and that it makes the englishmen almost hate the irishmen no matter in what part of the world they meet hear and if we can show them that the maintenance of such a system is a permanent disadvantage to the interests of the whole country i believe that the present irish land system will be swept away before four or five years have gone by cheers gentlemen i have invited your attendance here to night in order that we might strike out a practical scheme of organisation which will be forwarded in the first case by the help of our own people in this country but in which after a time we hope to embrace the english working classes and i feel sure that when we are able to put our case in its verity before them they will flock to our assistance in very large numbers hear hear i should be glad to have any practical questions that any gentleman present may be desirous of offering and i will conclude by regretting that i have detained you at such very inordinate length but i hope that the very great importance of the subject the importance of securing a permanent settlement of this wretched question which has kept classes in these country sic severed from each other for so many centuries and which has rendered miserable and destitute so many millions of our countrymen and countrywomen may plead my excuse and that you will be good enough to forgive me for the very extravagent sic of the observations i have made to you cheers mr parnell in replying said that the irish people had now learned to lead themselves and that there was no fear of a retrogade sic course on their part the people at home were going splendidly by themselves and the movement had not been in the least affected by coercion cheers the irish tenants had developed a spirit that he did not look for in his most sanguine moments and they saw as a result that the government really did not know what to do cheers in an unfortunate moment they had committed themselves to the support of this landlord institution in ireland and mr forster was applying his shoulder very vigorously to try and keep it up but he thought the result would be that both landlordism and mr forster would come down with a run together and that he would find himself very much the worse for the load he would discover upon his shoulders and his conscience laughter and cheers a vote of thanks was also passed to mr parnell and his colleagues for their manly conduct in parliament during the passing of the coercion act\n",

      "mr chairman and gentlemen in rising to return thanks for the way in which you have drunk the toast of prosperity to ireland coupled with my health i may perhaps be permitted before proceeding to discuss the question very intimately connected with the prosperity of ireland the land bill which was introduced a few days since by mr gladstone i may be permitted to refer however briefly to the course of action and pluck of the irish party since the commencement of this parliament as chairman of that party i think it would be proper for me on the present occasion addressing as i do many of my most influential constituents to touch upon this matter when the year before last i had the opportunity of addressing my former constituents in the county of meath at navan the conservative government was in power and upon that occasion i ventured to lay before them the definition of what i would conceive to be the true parliamentary policy for the irish party to adopt in opposition under the then circumstances i said after defining that policy that that parliamentary policy and action was one that was rendered necessary by the determined obstinacy and neglect of our claims of the worst government that had ever ruled ireland that was on the 12th of october that government when it entered office announced by their responsible representatives in this country the chief secretary of the lord lieutenant of ireland hisses the former chief secretary a voice they are all the same hear hear mr parnell that chief secretary told us that ireland was suffering from a surfeit of legislation the church act and land act and that we must rest a while and be thankful i then went on to say in passing from the question of parliamentary policy that the parliamentary policy of the party should be one sufficient and adequate to compel the attention of any english government to the wants of this country now sir i think that both in and out of parliament we have fulfilled our pledges and compelled the attention of the government applause to the wants of this country i never pretended for one moment that the methods of procedure which we were compelled to adopt against the conservative government would be necessary against the present whig or liberal government on the contrary on many occasions i have done before the liberal government came into office expressly pointed out that we should have to adopt in the face of a tory government applause and when this government came into office i recommended the irish party to adopt a certain line of policy differing materially from that which we found necessary to use for the purpose of compelling concessions from the conservatives at the conference of the irish land league held in when a plan of parliamentary land reform was submitted by a committee of which i had the honour of being a member it was decided that the irish members should press in the session of for a provisional measure of the suspension of the power of ejectment for two years these are the terms of the resolution which was adopted by the conference we therefore recommend as an ad interim measure in view of the desperate condition of the country until a comprehensive reform can be perfected one which shall suspend for two years ejectment for nonpayment of rent and overholding in the case of all holdings valued at a year and suspend for a similar period of two years in the case of any holding whatsoever the right of recovering a higher rent than the poor law valuation in pursuance of this resolution at the commencement of session of parliament we drafted a bill which was introduced by mr o'connor power which would have had the effect of suspending ejectments practically for two years a few days after the bill had been introduced we were enabled to bring it to second reading partly by accident and partly by good management and during the debate upon the second reading we obtained a half promise from the government that they would themselves move in the direction of suspending ejectments for two years and shortly afterwards the government introduced a bill very similar to mr o'connor power bill called the compensation for disturbance bill you all know the history of that measure the government brought it to a second reading and the irish members supported it at the second reading but at the committee stage they were induced by the tories so to alter its original shape as deprived it of much of its value and the members of the irish party numbering some forty felt it their duty on that occasion to leave the house in a body without voting the consequences of that step was that the government modified their bill again so as to destroy some of the bad effects of the previous modification they had assented to but as you all know the bill was finally thrown out by the house of lords hisses the programme of the land league recommending the suspension of ejectments for two years was not adopted but instead of that suspension of ejectments for two years we found that at the commencement of the present session the government suspended the constitution in ireland groans now it was left to the organization of the land league to do that which the government had failed to do and during the last quarter of the year by the organisation which we were able to effect by the courage and determination of our people we practically carried out the programme of our conference in april cheers we practically suspended ejectments in ireland cheers and we practically obtained for the tenants a reduction of their rents to griffith valuation loud cheers i say we practically suspended ejectments during the first three quarters of there were nearly ejectments giving to each quarter or souls rendered houseless and homeless during each of the three first quarters of the year making altogether a total of nearly persons rendered houseless and homeless up to the time when the land league commenced to perfect their organisation in the last quarter of the year after our organisation had been perfected we were able as i have said to suspend ejectments so far as to reduce them from in the previous quarter to about in that quarter cheers our success continued during the month of january notwithstanding that a coercion bill had been introduced by the government it was not until the bill had been very nearly passed that ejectments again commenced to rise in the month of january there were ejectments in february when it was apparent the bill was nearly through and would be certainly carried the landlords commenced to take courage groans and they raised the number of ejectments from to groans in march after the coercion bill was passed into law ejectments rose from in february to in other words the effect of coercion on the spirits of the landlords was such as to increase ejectments per cent in two months groans but i hope now that the effect of the coercion act is commencing to die away that the landlords will see it is useless for them to continue the struggle against a determined and a united people cheers but before i pass from this question of coercion i wish to refer for a moment to our opposition of that coercion hear hear it has been said that i promised to the country that it would be impossible for the government to carry a coercion bill i never promised anything of the kind applause several voices you did not mr parnell i promised to do this i promised at tipperary that we would oppose coercion as long as we could stand on the floor of the house of commons a voice so you did mr parnell i think we fulfilled our promise cheers but we never intended to prevent a liberal government from carrying coercion we could have successfully opposed coercion if the tories were in power because we should have been helped as mr butt was helped in by the very same whigs who now proposed coercion but with the whigs in power and with the tories helping them it became for us practically impossible to resist coercion hear hear but we could have successfully resisted coercion were it not for the desertion of of the irish members groans for them and cries of traitors renegades and scoundrels who broke all the pledges which they had made to their constituents to preserve the union of the irish party and who afterwards crossed the floor of the house and joined the government on the eve of the battle groans and then turned their weapons against their own countrymen hisses the defection of those members weakened us so much that it became possible for the government after a struggle which i venture to think will make it impossible for any government ever again to venture to propose coercion for this country it became possible for the government to tell us that we were a minority that we were only a section of the representatives of the irish people hisses and to pursue for this reason a course of action which they could not possible have undertaken against the majority of the irish people the irish constituencies should remember this they should remember that at a vital moment their independent party was crippled and coercion made possible by seventeen men who had been returned solemnly pledged to stand by our party and the constituencies should remember that it was in their power in the future to prevent such desertion cheers and we'll remember by executing prompt judgment on those men when they return for re election cheers we were charged during the long fight a fight which was not at all a pleasant one which was exceedingly unpleasant which was continued night and day for something like a week during which the small irish party were constantly fatigued in body and mind cheers with indeed obstructing the land bill we were told that we were delaying the remedial legislation of the government but you are aware that the government had not at this time shaped remedial legislation they had not made up their minds what remedial legislation they were to propose if the land bill had been proposed a fortnight or a month after the commencement of the session if would be a very weak land bill indeed cheers and cries of indeed it would so that the courage of the irish members in resisting coercion to the last and the courage of the county in upholding them in that course has been rewarded by having a much stronger bill brought after twenty two alterations than could have been possible or even thought of at the beginning of this month cheers now mr chairman and gentlemen this brings me to the land bill the land bill may be roughly divided into two main divisions as a matter of fact it is divided into a great many parts but for my purpose i would divide it into two divisions or parts the first division which deals with the question of rents and tenures and the second division which deals with the question of ownership of the reclamation of lands and with emigration and migration now sir the first part provides that the tenants subject to the operations of the act may apply to the court to fix what is called in the bill a fair rent a judicial or fair rent and this provision undoubtedly opens a fascinating prospect to the irish tenantry i believe that it is exceedingly probable that the great majority of the tenants in ireland will imagine that they are entering into an elysium when they are entering this court for the purpose of having a fair rent fixed for themselves but when we come to examine the construction of the court we find that it is one which has already and very justly forfeited the confidence of the irish tenants it is the same court which has been tried and found wanting in carrying out the land act of the county court or the quarter sessions as it used to be called is to fix the rent these courts are invariably manned by judges who are either landlord nominees or landlords themselves or relatives of landlords or members of whig or tory clubs hear hear in fact the great difficulty in obtaining justice is simply this that the court is invariably filled by the maintenance of landlord institutions and rackrents on the tenantry hear hear and cheers now one of the chief reasons of the failure of the act of was the courts hear hear and cheers now one of the chief reasons of the failure of the act of was the want of confidence in the constitution of these very courts hear hear and cheers when the people went into these courts they found that the decisions in a great many cases were given against them and they found that even when they obtained a favourable decision the amount gained was eaten up in costs not at all proportionate to the amount of the loss suffered by the tenant by being deprived of his holding hear hear and cheers the tenant was hampered upon every side in his resort to these courts hear hear it was exceedingly difficult for him to obtain a solicitor and in saying what i am now going to say i will not annoy any of my solicitor friends as i don't intend offence i say it was exceedingly difficult for the tenants to obtain a solicitor to plead their case because country attorneys dreaded appearing for the tenants fearing that they would be boycotted by the bench if they did so hear hear i do not refer to the judges presiding in county courts but those sitting on the bench at petty sessions whose good will it was of vital importance the local solicitors should cultivate hear hear that point suggests a matter of vital interest which is the getting rid of the present entire class of unpaid magistrates and of substituting for the present grand jury system elective county board cheering hundreds of evicted tenants who have been evicted since the passing of the land act of owing to the circumstances which i have related have been prevented from applying for compensation for improvements that they were entitled to under that act hear hear and cheers as it was hopeless for them to obtain justice of any kind owing to the heaviness of legal costs the consequence was that no tenants in ireland applied in this way except a few cases in mayo quite lately cheers only three cases of the kind occurred since the passing of the act of in which tenants evicted for non payment were compensated for disturbance under the 9th section although i am informed on good authority that thousands of tenants were evicted whose rights to compensation were quite as valid as those who obtained it cries of hear hear a voice you are right mr parnell i may state that under the 9th section of the land act tenants evicted for non payment of rent if that rent is found to be exorbitant may claim compensation for disturbance and that claim has never been allowed except in three cases cheers indeed i may say that i have been informed by a legal friend that the chairman of a western county did not seem to know of the existence of the 9th section and he seemed quite incapable of interpreting the provisions of that section laughter county court judges and the constitution of county courts are exceedingly defective and i consider that to make these courts the tribunal in which the fixing of a fair rent is settled is one of the vital defects of this bill hear hear and great cheering now there are many defects in the bill besides those of defective machinery and before i proceed to examine them i will say that if we judge by what mr gladstone stated the other night as the result of a working of that portion of the bill it is not likely to be satisfactory to the irish tenants i think you would agree with me that any bill which does not largely reduce the rents of the majority of the irish tenants will and ought to fail to give satisfaction to them cheering a voice there is no doubt of that mr parnell we have testimony to that effect from the reports of both the royal commissions which have recently inquired into the question both of these reports agree in stating that a large number of the tenants are in bankruptcy and that many thousands are unable to pay any rent at all hear hear what was the language that i find mr gladstone used in introducing this bill the other night he says that the present legislation was not due to misconduct on the part of the landlords and that on the contrary as a rule they have stood their trials and have as a rule been acquitted no no i may mention he goes on the third and conclusive reason for this legislation is i may say that a limited number of the class have been distinguished by conduct different from the predominant number there have been both arbitrary raisings of rent and harsh and cruel evictions it may seem hard where there are so many landlords to say that a class must be liable to interference on account of the acts or omissions of the few but so it is and so it must be under the iron necessity of public affairs so here some landlords have contrived to inflict on their brethren and on their own class much dishonour and much inconvenience we see therefore that the bill is only intended to interfere with the few landlords and not with the prominent number of them now sir i venture to think that any bill that does not interfere with the large majority of irish landlords will not have the slightest chance of successfully closing this question now to go into some of the palpable and patent defects of the first part of the measure i am not going into any exhaustive criticism of it it has only been printed a few days and it is of an exceedingly intricate character one which requires careful investigation by gentlemen learned in the law i simply propose to refer to the defects which are patent to everybody on a casual examination we have first of all the fact that tenants forced to take leases since the passing of the land act of at exorbitant rents of which there are a vast number are debarred from the benefit of this bill before their leases expire we have certainly the fact that all arrears of rent must be paid up before the tenant can apply to the court to fix a fair rent we know from the report of the bessborough commission that an enormous number of tenants are in arrears of their rents and that they are helplessly unable to pay them and hence it will follow that the tenants will have to borrow money to pay these arrears shall have to submit to eviction and be only permitted to sell their tenant right by submitting to pay all of the arrears of rent now that is a very unsatisfactory provision and it is one which applies to tenants who are liable to be evicted before the passing into law of this measure it was pointed out in the house of commons that tenants liable to be evicted before the passing of the measure will if the period of six months redemption does not expire before the passing of the bill be able to apply to the court to fix the rent and to sell the interest of their holdings at the rent fixed but the persons to whom they will sell their interests will be persons entitled to very little benefit under the bill they will be tenants of the status of future tenants and not of the present tenants the difference between the present tenants and future tenants is this that future tenants are not permitted to apply to the court to fix their rents and are given very little protection whatever they in fact are tenants who might go to the landlord after the passing of the bill and undertake as ordinary contracting tenants to pay a certain rent for the holding so that it is manifest that the tenant selling his interest under such circumstances would sell it at a very great disadvantage subject to all arrears of rent and subject to the fact that the tenancy he was selling would be a future tenancy and not a present tenancy there is another defect in the bill in addition to the fact that all arrears of rent must be paid the tenant who may have been paying a rack rent for a number of years two or three years or perhaps twenty or thirty years and who may have got into debt to money lenders or shopkeepers to pay his rent is not entitled to take into account the fact that this exorbitant rent has been paid for a number of years i think that in valuing the interest of the tenant in his holding the court ought surely be entitled to take into account such a matter if the tenant has been paying a rack rent to the landlord for a great number of years he should be entittled sic to restitution in the future payment of his rent applause i do not think i can do better before quiting this portion of the bill than to read to you criticisms which were passed on the principle of fixing rents by the committee of the land league in to which i have previously referred that committee was at the time engaged with criticism of the bill of the late mr butt a bill i may say which the first part of the government bill very much resembles in fact the criticism of the bill may be applied word for word with very slight changes to the first portion of the bill of the government fixity of tenure at fair rents is no doubt an attractive phrase but its only merit is that it is attractive let us examine it as a proposed solution of the land question and first as to fair rents how is the fairness or unfairness of rents to be determined for an answer we must appeal to part of mr butt bill wherein provisions are set forth purporting to enable the occupiers of land to obtain certain rights and secure tenure clause of the bill provides that the chairman shall give to the tenant a declaration of tenancy and shall specify the rent to be paid by him in respect of such promises now if you substitute the fixing of fair rents for declaration you have criticism which applies to the present bill how was he to obtain the benefit of mr butt measure mr parnell then recited the expensive legal process which would have to be restored to for the purpose and read the programme which was adopted for the consideration of the conference named they feeling convinced that it was inexpedient to maintain and impossible to amend the present relations between landlord and tenant the question presented itself what measure of land reform did the exigencies of the situation demand and then the said finally that they were of opinion that the establishment of peasant proprietary was the only solution of the question mr parnell continued we propose to establish it firstly by forcible expropriation of the bad landlords and secondly by the state advancing money to the tenants to buy their holdings from the landlord willing to sell them these holdings it is impossible to adopt any alternative of the solution presented by the first portion of the government bill except the compulsory expropriation of bad landlords cheers i think that such solution would be far easier much less expensive much quieter and would lead to far more satisfactory results to both landlords and tenants cheers there would be some certainty about such a scheme there will be none as to the proceedings of the courts i defy anybody to predict with certainty as to what will be the result of the application to the court provided by the bill by the numerous tenants through ireland which will undoubtedly apply the moment the bill becomes law hear hear in leaving the first portion of the measure i will shortly describe the position when i think the irish members and the irish people ought to take up with regard to this portion of the bill it is as i have said a matter of great doubt and difficulty to anticipate what it is likely to be we are bound to free ourselves from responsibility for its possible failure and probable friction or difficulty of working and the government having their own accord proposed such a solution we might i think devote our attention to pointing out and attempting to remedy its defects during the passage of the measure through parliament hear hear and after its enactment into law we should use the resources of the land league and the permanent organisation we have established for the purpose of enabling the tenant farmers to make the best of its provisions hear hear the complete organisation of the tenantry and the power of the land league will undoubtedly enable us to overcome many of its defects and make the most of any advantages which it offers cheers the first part of the bill will certainly render it more difficulty for a landlord to evict or rackrent tenants in the future though i fear as i said at the commencement of my remarks upon this subject that at best it will prove disappointing to the bulk of the tenantry who trust to its provisions hear hear i now turn to the provisions of the measure to the working of which i look forward with much more hope and from which i anticipate much better results i refer to the provisions establishing a peasant proprietary and enabling public companies to buy land in this country for the purpose of emigrating thereto the tenants from the crowded districts cheers i may shortly state that the provisions of the second portion of the bill are taken almost line for line from the recommendations of the committee of the land league of last april i would remind you of some of the names of the gentlemen composing that committee michael davitt of portland prison was one of its prominent members patrick egan now an exile in paris cheers was another and i myself had the honour of being one of its members i cannot i think do better than quote to you the main provisions of this portion of the bill comparing them with the corresponding passages in the report of our committee of this portion of the bill provides for the appointment of a commission to be termed the land commission with power to acquire and hold land for the purposes of the act the report of our committee recommended the creation of a commission of land administration for ireland with power to deal with all questions relating to land in ireland the bill provides that the commission may advance sums to the tenants for the purpose of enabling them to purchase their holdings to an extent not exceeding three fourths of the purchase money and to secure to the tenant the title of such holding and that the advances thus made by the commissioners to the tenants should be repaid by the tenants by an annuity in favour of the land commission for years of for every of such advance the report of our committee recommended that where the landlord and tenant of any holding had agreed for the sale to the tenant of the said holding the commission should execute the necessary conveyance to the tenant and advance him the whole or part of the purchase money and upon such advance being made by the commission such holding shall be deemed to be charged with an annuity of for every of such advance such annuity to be limited in favour of the commission and to be repayable in years cheers another provision in the bill provides that the commission may purchase any estate for the purpose of re selling to the tenants their holdings comprised in such estates the money being advanced to the tenants instead of re selling their holdings to the tenants the commission are also empowered to adopt the alternative course of letting to outlying tenants their holdings in fee farm as a perpetual tenancy at a fixed rent i may add in passing that i look upon this power of letting holdings to tenants in fee farm as the most valuable provision of the whole measure cheers as it secures to the tenants of such estates as are allowed to take advantage of this part of the measure the right of becoming permanent tenants at a reduction of fully per cent on their present rents cheers in fact i don't see how rackrenting landlords can receive any money at all for their estates or any rents in future except under the provisions of this portion of the bill cheers our committee made a similar recommendation to acquire the ownership of an estate and to resell as it stood to the tenant or to let the holdings to them at a fixed rent equal to 3½ per cent on the purchase money the bill adopted many of our recommendations as to the simplification of title registration and so forth which it is not necessary for me to refer to here the only objectionable feature of this part of the measure is the emigration scheme cheers i look upon this emigration scheme as deliberately intended to clear off a very large number of small tenants throughout ireland cheers these small tenants are the very tenants who have been paying rack rents amounting in very many cases to three times the government valuation for years cheers and they are the tenants whom this bill designs to emigrate to some british colonial possession groans and cries of no emigration now i think we ought to set our faces determinedly against anything of the sort cheers and they are the tenants whom this bill designs to emigrate to some british colonial possession groans and cries of no emigration we should claim for the small tenants of ireland the men who by their sufferings have ripened this question for solution cheers who by their endurance and courage have compelled the attention of this powerful government to this land question cheers we should claim for them the full protection that is provided for the richest tenant under this measure cheers we must not neglect or forget our weaker brethren we must see that as far as we can effect it before the bill leaves the house of commons these small tenants are secured as far as the measure can secure them in the rights and interests which the bill intended for the irish farmers cheers i think in conclusion with regard to the last portion of this measure that it will probably lead to very remarkable results if our people maintain their attitude of determination cheers but if you should imagine that you have gained the day merely because the government bring forward a long bill containing many clauses you will be bitterly disappointed in the result cheers i said a year or so ago that the measure of the land bill to be introduced by the government would be the measure of your own determination and energy and i wish to say to day that the measure of protection which will be conferred to any tenant by the action of this bill if it passes into law will be the measure of your determination and energy into the future if you neglect to rely upon yourselves you will find that the courts will give you very scant mercy but if you should as you have done in the past that you have the power to settle this question by your own exertions then you may depend upon it the courts will be anxious to give you as good a settlement as you can obtain of yourselves without them cheers as a permanent result i should hope for the whole measure that after a few years it will lead to the fulfilment of davitt programme the abolition of landlordism and the prosperity of ireland cheers i do not wish you to trust too much in legislation which is likely to be passed by the present parliament if i have criticised the first portion of the bill at length i have done so because i have felt it my duty to warn you because it is full of pitfalls doubts and dangers it is a treacherous policy this which provides recourse to courts but as i said at the commencement it has been offered to us by the government let us then regarding it as we do as a very small amelioration of the condition of the tenant farmers let us do our best to amend it in parliament and let us do our best after it is passed to secure its working as far as we possibly can the condition of the people of ireland is a problem at the present moment i do not think that ever in the course of history have we had more reason to congratulate ourselves upon our position than at the present moment you have withstood manfully the threats and intimidation of the present government a voice and so have you mr parnell and if the land bristles with soldiery though you have been tempted to the commission of acts violence and retaliation you have stood you ground within the limits of the constitution you have shown this government that though they can be unlawful and overbearing though they may have recourse to violent acts against the rights and liberties of our country that you know how to preserve your calm and steadfast attitude and that you will continue to preserve that attitude to the end loud and prolonged cheering\n",

      "i have great pleasure in receiving the address coming as it does from the successors of men who did not hesitate to surrender their life in what under other circumstances would have been considered a shameful death but which all irishmen and i trust in future all the world will recognise as as sic having been a glorious death hear hear i can assure you that i value your address at no small worth the land question is undoubtedly not a national question we do not desire to mix up one with the other i have repeatedly pointed out that the irish land league has certain specific objects and that it believes that in carrying out those objects it does not interfere with or encounter any other programme or objects at the same time it is proper for me to say that whilst there is nothing lying behind or concealed in the programme of the irish national land league there are many men who belong to that body who believed and who would take every reasonable opportunity of contesting their belief in the right of irish nationality hear hear speaking for myself i don't consider that if the irish people were comfortable and prosperous they would the less desire to resume their place amongst the nations of the earth hear hear i do not believe in starving any people into a spirit of nationality that i shall leave to the future none of us can tell what may be the solution of the question i may have my opinion about it and i know that the gentlemen who have presented this address to me have their opinion how far these views are divergent must be left for time to solve how far the programme which the gentlemen of the united irish national association have placed before them is a possible one must be left for the future to decide but i say that the programme of the land league interferes with no other school of thought it does not interfere with those who think that england and ireland may form a partnership in future upon the basis of right and justice to both parties it does not interfere with those who think that ireland is entitled to independence hear hear i thank you again gentlemen for the honour you have done me mr parnell m p who was received with prolonged and enthusiastic cheering said he had first to apologise for the very great inconvenience which he had caused by the postponement of the meeting from the previous day but the meeting of the land league in dublin was of enormous national importance and he knew that his fellow countrymen in manchester would waive their own personal feelings for the good of the national cause cheers one of the great difficulties which had to be contended with in the present movement a movement which he might shortly describe as one of the purpose of enlightening the english working classes with regard to the merits of the irish question was the difficulty of disseminating information with regard to the real state of affairs in ireland hear hear he did not know whether they could hope to succeed in their movement of trying to tell the english people what was the truth of the irish question but they thought they ought to try and he hoped in the end they would succeed cheers they had however enormous odds against them it was considered an axiom founded on experience that no nation was sufficiently strong or wise to govern another nation and hence it was no discredit to the english people that they had failed in their task of governing ireland and in his opinion they would continue to fail until they allowed the irish people to govern themselves cheers one of the reasons why that was so was that it was impossible to spread information in england with regard to ireland first of all they had the english daily newspapers against them universally and those papers regulated their news by laws of supply and demand and they had a constant supply of untruths sent over by their irish correspondents those papers were generally read by the middle classes who formed the balancing power in english politics and practically had the government of the country in their own hands and it was not at all surprising that the opinion of these people would be decidedly adverse to ireland sometimes when he himself was out of ireland and had not an opportunity of seeing any but english papers he almost began to believe that ireland was going from bad to worse and was in fact in a state of anarchy and he was therefore not astonished that englishmen should believe that the irish people were the most consummate race of blackguards that ever existed cheers the task they had before them was to tell the english people the truth about ireland so that they might be able to shame the newspapers into giving correct information and he believed that by doing so they were doing good to the english working classes there were now something like forty thousand soldiers in ireland including the royal irish constabulary and their presence there cost the english working classes an annual payment of four millions sterling and their principal duty was collecting the rents levied on the improvements of the irish tenants in the face of famine the irish tenants in the last couple of years asked for a reduction of rents in order to save them from starvation the landlords at first refused but the land league had since compelled the reduction cheers what he specially wished to point out in making these statements was this that though owing to the mineral and manufacturing resources of england she had not suffered as they had in ireland from the feudal system this land question was keeping the two peoples separate and it was driving the labouring classes of ireland over to england in order to compete with the artisan populations in this country and lower their rate of wages hear hear every man and woman driven out of ireland during the past years by the rapacity of the landlords might have remained there if there had only been an ordinarily decent land system in ireland they had been told that ireland was over populated but it had a less population in the square mile than any other country in europe ireland wanted the work of every man and woman driven out since the famine to develop her resources which were less developed than even recently discovered districts in america and australia they wanted their people for rescuing the waste lands from the state of barrenness into which they had fallen if there was a decent system of land tenure in ireland they could produce double or treble the amount of food in the shape of beef mutton and butter and the english labouring classes would obtain that produce at a cheaper rate but in fact their whole case was misrepresented and the irish people were denounced as midnight assassins and marauders in order that english sympathy might not be enlisted in their favour and that the most odious tyranny that ever disgraced civilisation might be maintained hear he now came to the question of the bill introduced by mr gladstone in the house of commons the other night before proceeding to criticise it he would say that he believed that in introducing it he had considered that it was not possible for him to carry a more extended measure than that which he had now laid before parliament applause and that if he had considered that he had had the means to do so he would have made it a bill which would have satisfied the reasonable expectations of the irish people cheers which this bill did not but of course every english statesmen sic must cut his coat according to his cloth mr gladstone could not be expected to wreck his party even for the sake of settling the irish question and had considered the forces he had to contend with on the one side and the forces he had to support him on the other side and of what material was his party in the house of commons composed it was composed in the main of men who were entirely ignorant of the land question and the general situation of affairs in ireland and who were ready to swallow any fable that was paraded before them applause he had been very much struck with the description in a liverpool paper of the recommendations by which a liberal candidate was supported for the vacancy at liskeard they were that the candidate was a landed proprietor a captain in the yeomanry a member of a hunting club and was also a banker he had no object to the last qualification because bankers were out of the field applause but he did object to the landed proprietor they were engaged in ireland in the attempt to overthrow the feudal system of land tenure which was introduced by england when ireland was conquered that system existed in england but it had not done so much harm in england because it had grown there with the growth of the country but it was imported into ireland as an exotic and had never thrived there the materials which mr gladstone had to rely upon to carry his land bill were composed for their living on the fact that they were the owners of land under this land tenure and from them they were to expect the present house of commons would pass an act which would be satisfactory to the irish people hear hear independent of the difficulties with which mr gladstone had to contend the question itself was a very difficult one it was a tangled heritage of generations the national land league in considering the best solution of this question came to the conclusion that it was impossible to reconcile and inexpedient to maintain the restricted interests of landlord and tenant in the soil in other words they recommended the expropriation of the bad landlords and the extending of advantages to the tenants to enable them to purchase their voluntary holdings from the landlords instead of the compulsory expropriation of the bad landlords which the land league recommended mr gladstone brought in a measure designed to compel the landlords to reduce their rents he did not think this measure would be successful because the condition of land tenure was such as to make it almost impossible for a partnership to exist between the landlord and the tenant it was not like a partnership in business where both had every inducement to pull together and to agree with each other as to the distribution of the profits but it was a partnership in the case of the land between men who did everything to make the land valuable and men who did nothing to make it valuable but still it was a recognition of the great principle of the right of the tenants to property in the land as well as the landlords cheers when that principle had been recognised by the legislature as mr gladstone measure admitted and when the impossibility of the task had been discovered they would then have mr gladstone or some other english minister going to parliament and saying they must do as the king of prussia did they must expropriate the landlords and appropriate the land to those who cultivated it cheers thus they would see that the bill was an advance because it recognised for the first time the principle of joint proprietorship between the landlord and tenant in the soil but it did not supply practical machinery or adequate means for the purpose of enabling the tenant to obtain a practical recognition of his proprietorship they feared it was impossible to supply any such practical means but during the progress of the bill through committee they would do all in their power to amend it and make its working more feasible they would thus see the enormous difficulties which met the tenant at the very first outset in establishing the claim which this bill of mr gladstone acknowledged to him cheers even the small tenants and many of the larger tenants had to contend against a load of arrears of rent and of debt to the shopkeepers and he wished to express his belief that the tenant farmer who owed rent to his landlord and who owed nothing to the shopkeeper stood in a more honourable position than the tenant farmer who owed no rent but owed money to the shopkeeper applause because the latter would be borrowing in food or in money from the shopkeeper for the purpose of paying an impossible rent to the landlord hear hear these small tenants before they could even take the initial step to enter into this complicated legal proceeding of applying to the court for the purpose of ascertaining what a fair rent should he must pay off their arrears of rent those arrears had accumulated in two ways firstly on account of the rack rents that many of the landlords had been charging over a series of years and secondly on account of the bad seasons commencing in and finishing in which brought the majority of the small owners to the verge of starvation cheers before they could obtain any assistance or recognition from the court they were practically speaking obliged to pay off all arrears of rent for if they did not do so the only option left was that they should sell their interest to the best bidder ireland at the present time had been drained of capital and therefore that would simply mean that if a tenant had to sell at a time when there were no buyers it would not be a free sale but a forced sale cheers those were some of the difficulties in connection with the working of that part of the land bill of mr gladstone which purported to establish a system of joint proprietorship between landlord and tenant the position the irish national land league took was this that it was impossible to establish a joint proprietorship between laziness and industry applause he had stumbled through a very dry recital of facts but facts were very hard things to get over before he sat down he would say finally as regarded this land bill that they did not wish to adopt any unreasonable attitude towards it hear hear they feared in fact they felt almost certain that in its present shape it could not bring about a final shape it could not bring about a final settlement of the irish land question hear hear on the contrary they feared that under its operations many hundreds of thousands of their people would be driven into exile cries of shame and no they thought it was their duty to raise a warning voice in time cheers they thought that they ought to point out the defects which underlay the principle of the bill the impossibility of reconciling the respective interests of the landlord and the tenant in the land and if they failed as he feared they must fail in obtaining from the present parliament the adoption of their views with regard to that portion of the question they would further endeavour to so amend the bill in committee as to render the departure from this vital principle of as little injury to their people as possible cheers they did not desire to obstruct mr gladstone in any attempt that he might make to govern ireland according to his lights but they thought that he must fail cheers and he trusted that the experience that he and other english statesmen were gaining from their repeated failures as regarded ireland would ultimately induce them to acknowledge their right to self government cheers they had never at any time desired to obstruct the present ministry or to waste the time of parliament they were charged with the offence and they would obstruct and oppose coercion to the last cheers and it was their duty to do so but they had never opposed any measure for the benefit of the people of this country cheers during the existence of the present parliament they had never opposed any measure brought forward by the government of any kind whatever because they had admitted that the tendency of the legislation of the present ministry was for the general benefit of the people of england cheers and it would be sinful for them to obstruct and oppose such legislation they did oppose very sternly and with very successful results some of the legislation of the last ministry they opposed but not successfully the annexation of the transvaal cheers he recollected that seven irish members opposed the house of commons for twenty six hours to prevent the passing of a measure involving the annexation and they opposed successfully the flogging clause of the army discipline dill sic they obstructed those clauses of the prisons bill inflicting inhuman and degrading treatment upon political and untried prisoners he remembered coming down to the free trade hall about that time and he was supported by the enthusiastic help of the people of manchester he thanked them for their help that day the irish cause was advancing with giant strides applause their people were united shoulder to shoulder cheers wherever the irish race existed in all countries and in every clime men spoke of the condition of ireland of the fate of the irish tenants the things that were done to their people in times gone by were no longer possible he believed there was a brilliant future before their race and that before many years were gone by the exiles of erin who in england and america had contributed so much to press this question home would be in the position of congratulating themselves upon the complete righting of the people at home and upon the restoration to ireland of the right to rule and govern herself as england governed herself\n",

that which now met him he had come there to talk about the irish land question for it was of considerable importance that it should be thoroughly discussed in england and scotland at present as well as across the channel the situation in ireland was an exceedingly grave one by dint of exertions of which they could have no conception whatever and by means of the sufferings of the people for the past two or three years which he could not attempt to describe and by the assistance of the men and women of the irish race in america they had brought the land question to a point at which he believed it was possible if not to settle it at least to go a very long way in the direction of settlement cheers it was therefore of the most vital importance that there should be a proper understanding and appreciation held in this country with regard to the true bearings of that question having given as an example of the manner in which the people in england were misled as to irish affairs by citing the speech of mr plunket in reference to colonel king harman property and the subsequent contradiction of his statements by the freeman commissioner he said that a great many persons asked if by settling the irish land question they meant robbing the landlords they did not want to rob the landlords but give them a very good price for their land a very much better price for their land a very much better price than if they waited a few years longer cheers they pointed to the fact that in old days in ireland the ancestors of the present tenants had a joint proprietorship in the land with their chieftains the land was formerly held under the tribal system and the chief exercised a suzerainty but he was not entitled to rack rent them or exercise any arbitrary powers over them during the many confiscations of the land as the result of english conquest the tenant right of the tillers of the soil was taken away from them and now what mr gladstone proposed to do was to restore a portion of their right cheers he did not know whether he would succeed the question of a joint proprietary was a very difficult one all great authorities on the subject held that it was almost impossible to bring about a joint proprietorship and the best system of cultivating the soil was that by which the tiller of the land owned it cheers there was also the fact that they had no precedent for the successful working of a joint proprietorship a great many other countries had tried it in prussia before they abolished the landlords by compulsory expropriation they had to a certain extent a system of the kind but in prussia they found it unworkable and they adopted the easier method of making the occupier of the land the owner however mr gladstone was going to make the attempt and supposing it was a bona fide attempt and would not bring any additional ills on the country they ought to give it a trial he himself believed the only way in which the land question could be settled was to make the tiller of the soil the owner c heers sic it was impossible for any one to predict whether the result of this bill would be to make the interest of the landlord more secure or whether it would lead to the establishment of a peasant proprietary but if he thought it would strengthen the present system or obstruct the establishment of a peasant proprietary he would rather cut off his right hand than accept it if mr gladstone attempt were a bona fide one and not likely to inflict sufferings and injury on the country he though sic they ought to tolerate it and give it a fair trial hear hear in mr gladstone opening statement he congratulated himself on the fact that a large number of small owners had disappeared since they had disappeared through the action of famine and emigration and their disappearance was not at all a subject for congratulation hear hear he also said that the land question could not receive a complete solution without free help for emigration these were ominous words and the fact that the bill included emigration clauses made them feel that as regards the small holders in ireland the intentions of the government really were tending towards a settlement of the tenants in the land and securing them in their tenant right there were in ireland small farmers of less than annual valuation many of them were very poor and a large number in arrears of rent a rent impossible to pay in view of its highness and the recent bad seasons they were not to be allowed the benefit of the bill so far as it fixed a fair and judicial rent until they paid off the arrears otherwise the landlords could evict them it was no matter if the rent from which the arrears were due was double that which might be decided as a fair rent in future and no matter how unjust the old rent might have been no matter how distressed the condition of the country at the time the tenant had no rights unless he could sell his interest in his holding he objected to that provision a tenant in arrear should be allowed like other tenants to apply to the land court to fix a fair rent and when it was fixed he should be allowed to pay up his arrears on the basis of that rent cheers as regarded the other tenants of whom there were a great number in ireland who had borrowed either directly or indirectly from the shop keeper in order to enable them to keep out of debt with the landlord in other words paying the landlords impossible rents out of the pockets of the shop keepers he thought that if the court decided that the future fair rent was less than what they had been paying during the past three or four years since the distress in ireland commenced that circumstances should be taken into consideration in bringing about a further reduction of rent so as to enable them to pay off their debts to the shopkeepers and start afresh hear hear these were both exceedingly reasonable propositions and he would be surprised if when put to the house of commons and the people of england mr gladstone would not be able to agree to them they thought that if the bill passed at all it should be equally beneficial to the small as well as the large holders and they should recollect that it was the small tenants by their sufferings who had ripened the question for solution there was a case in the history of ireland of the forty shilling freeholders obtaining one of the most remarkable reforms but immediately that reform was obtained the were swept away out of the country now they ought not to allow the people who obtained the present reform to be swept away they should first insist on the emigration clauses being swept out of the bill and secondly they should demand amendments so that those in arrears of rent should obtain due recognition there was plenty of land in ireland capable of great improvement he did not refer to waste land because there was a great deal of land in ireland which in face of american compensation and the wonderfully rich territories coming into cultivation in minnesota and illinois would not pay the expense of reclaiming and tilling but he meant what he would designate as semi waste land capable of improvement and which might be purchased at a reasonable price and allocated to some of those small tenants living on the hillsides and bogs and who would be only too happy to break it up and bring it into a high state of cultivation and pay for it to the very last farthing hear hear the land laid down in permanent pasture and which ought not to be laid down was estimated at two million acres and that extent was in use for grazing purposes by the landlords themselves who had not capital to break up and till the land the consequences was that it was deteriorating after year and in another nine or ten years would be absolutely useless if it could be purchased and parcelled out amount the smaller tenants of ireland there would be an amount of increased food supply which would be of immense importance to the labouring classes in england if the people of ireland really recognised that their labour was to be for themselves and that they were to reap what they sowed if there could be established schools of agriculture to show them what could be made out of the land he believed double the amount of beef mutton and butter could be sent to england hear hear he would ask the people of newcastle to stand by them on this coming land bill they could not allow the people to be emigrated for ireland wanted all her people to develop her industrial resources if she got the right of self government cheers they could borrow money on their own property and could build harbours drain their fields make railways and tramways and do many things now impossible because they were not allowed to put the hands in their own pockets he believed the time was coming when they would obtain the boon of self government for ireland cheers when the english people would abandon the insane jealousy which led them to try and keep all power regarding ireland in their own hands and cease to arrogate to the statesmen of this country a knowledge and governing capacity which no statesman of any other country had ever shown themselves to possess if they got that right they could give remunerative employment to every man woman and child in ireland and the people would not be driven to england to pull down the rate of wages cheers the two nations would learn to live together in harmony and he believed that after a time a better conscience among english people with regard to ireland would lead them to believe that after all it was not necessary to continue to inflict injustice on ireland hear with the spread of true democratic principles in england with the better instruction of the english masses on the irish question would come the day when it would be impossible for any english minister to apply to the people for coercion cheers as an irishman he believed in the right of ireland to self government she contained within herself all the elements of nationhood at the same time the two nations were very close together and he did not see why they should not arrange to live side by side in unity and harmony ireland had no interest in perpetuating this struggle she had got the worst of it all along the line and at present anyone in ireland was liable to be put in prison on suspicion england certainly had no reason to maintain the present state of things there the english working classes were taxed heavily for the maintenance of armed forces in ireland and as long as they were face to face with the irish question they would have to keep up their forty thousand men in ireland if it was not for them england hold on this country at the present moment would not be worth five minutes purchase cheers he would ask them were they content that this state of affairs should last in order that two or three thousand irish landlords should draw rack rents from the people no no he thought the day was coming when the english people would feel as indignant as the irish at this question and would turn to their rulers and demand a severe reckoning for their stewardship he felt a deep interest in everything which concerned the welfare of the masses of the people and he had been always anxious to do away with harsh treatment whether in prisons or in the army he was glad to think the irish members were mainly instrumental in the abolition of the cat cheers and the prisoners arrested under the coercion act were not being brutally treated it was all due to the irish members cheers there was no reason why irish members should not work with english members for the purpose of ameliorating the condition of the masses and he had always endeavoured to do that so far as lay in his power and encouraged irishmen with whom he had any influence to do so hear hear the english people when they understood the irish better would not find them so bad as a people of as individuals he would ask them to support irishmen in their attempt to get real measures for the amelioration of their condition\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with the greatest warmth the whole audience rising said that he thought it would do the hearts and spirits of struggling tenants in many parts of ireland good if they could see that magnificent meeting of irishmen and scotchmen assembled to express sympathy for them cheers he had during the past ten days attended several meetings in the great cities of england and he had everywhere found in the hearts of englishmen a most intense anxiety to be informed with regard to this irish land question they had always had the practical sympathy and help of irishmen living in england and scotland in their struggles at home but they had not until recently met with the desire on the part of englishmen to thoroughly study the subject and it was exceedingly difficult for englishmen and scotchmen to understand a question which was outside their own country in the first place they had a powerful and educated class in ireland the irish landlords hisses and all their dependents who were interested in misinforming public opinion in this country on the irish question and hence it happened when there was an irish movement they had to struggle against a force of misrepresentation and calumny the irish land league had had to struggle against these influences and one of the reasons he appeared there was to explain to scotchmen the position the land league had had taken up on the point the land act of admitted for the first time that the irish tenant had some kind of a property in land it was not allowed that that measure had proved a total failure for the protection of the tenant and the rents had been increased far more in the ten years since than in the decade preceding the passing of the act and as they said mr gladstone came forward with this bill of for the purpose of attempting further to protect this tenant right the land league thought that as regarded a very large number of the irish tenants certainly a great number of the small tenants this attempt would be a failure hear hear they pointed out that no successful example existed of the working out of that system of joint proprietorship in the land proposed in the bill and that nothing would answer but compulsory expropriation of the landlords mr parnell entered at some length into a description of the working of the provisions of the land bill and condemned the composition of the proposed new courts which had proved so defective in carrying out the clauses of the act of as far as the machinery of this bill was concerned they were confronted with the fear that the courts would not deal out equal justice to the irish tenants for they would be composed of the classes of men who were friends of the landlords the tenants could not enter on an expensive litigation in order to defend the tenant right in their little holdings most of them were sunk in debt either to their landlords or to the shopkeepers and under the bill of mr gladstone the smaller tenants had the mockery of going through an expensive course of law and were obliged to pay their rackrents before they could claim the benefits to be derived under its provisions hear hear the larger class of tenants who had money to depend on by litigation would be probably able to obtain reductions under the provisions of the bill but he was afraid they would not obtain a suitable reduction and the result would be disappointing to the small tenants the act would prove no protection nay more it would prove their destruction for it was evidently the notion of the government to inaugurate a gigantic scheme for their emigration they had proof of that in the speech introducing the bill made by the premier as well as in the reports of the two commissions which had recently reported to the house of commons they said that the government desired to rid ireland of these small holders and that was really a blinking of the whole question hear hear he had recommended migration instead of emigration migration from the west to the east instead of from connaught to america but they did not require even that professor baldwin had stated in his evidence that if fifty or sixty thousand families desired to migrate they would meet with no difficulty that there were semi waste lands now under grass which if given to the labourers at a fair rent would allow the migration of a hundred thousand families there was no one more inured than an irishman to labour when the result of that labour went to himself and no one had more unwillingness to work like a slave for another the government had refused to adopt the scheme of professor baldwin and their adoption of the idea of emigration had earned for them the hostility of the irish people and their representatives cheers they could not allow those small holders to be banished from ireland cheers they had had enough of emigration in the past and he did not think irish emigration had done the english working classes any good if he mr parnell had his own way with regard to irish land and he spoke as a practical man he should work it in such a way as to bring back and find employment for every irish man woman and child who had left ireland to come to england cheers referring to the increase of rents in ireland he instanced the case of the estates of sir richard wallace in the north which were rented at in the year and were now paying no less than a score times over that amount he could quote hundreds of instances given in evidence before the two land commissions where the rents of tenants had been raised on them for improvements since the passing of the act of three and four times over if mr gladstone wished the support of the irish people for this bill let them really show they intended to protect these small holders in their little properties and they could do it very easily if they thought fit cheers if they failed it would be the last chance any english statesman ever would have prolonged applause the conscience of the civilised world would no longer permit these successive famines and these successive depopulations the irish race at home and abroad was too united and too determined to put up with any further trifling with this question hear hear they did not what the chicanery of the courts for the purpose of protecting the interests of their tenant farmers their rights were founded on justice and it should not require a lawsuit to ascertain and fix them cheers they could point out the way in which this feudal land tenure had been determined and ended in every other country and they could surely ask that liberal england that preached liberality to all the other nations that annexed islands in the mediterranean because they were misgoverned and engaged in a crusade for the autonomy of bulgaria and for the preservation of the integrity of greece they asked that liberal england should at last turn her eyes to suffering ireland and extend to her those principles she had been preaching for the edification of other nations cheers and that the right might be given to labourers in ireland to benefit by the result of their labour for after all the irish land question was a labourers question if the english people did this they promised them that they would make their food a great deal better because for every pound of beef and mutton and butter now sent from ireland they would be able to send two hear hear they would keep the irish people at home so that they might no longer lower the wages of the industrial classes in england cheers and perchance the national struggle and animosity which so long lasted between the two nations might also find some mode of settlement and england and ireland might come to learn that there was some course which might be adopted to the mutual and equal advantage of both and by which the strife of centuries might be terminated cheers if that could be done the english liberal party would have something to boast of up to the present they had simply used this irish question for their own political purposes they had made great professions when they were out of office and when they had been in office they had been the worst in their measures of oppression hear hear he felt exceedingly gratified for the opportunity he had of addressing such an audience of glasgow men and he hoped some of his words had thrown light upon a most difficult question and perhaps some of the scotchmen present would bear away with them the impression that the irish national land league was not composed of assassins and midnight marauders as they had been accused prolonged cheering\n",

      "he said he thought it would do the hearts and spirits of the struggling tenantry in many parts of ireland good if they could see the magnificent meeting before him of irishmen and scotchmen assembled to express sympathy for them he had during the last ten days attended several meetings in the great cities of england and he had everywhere found on the part of englishmen a most intense anxiety to be informed with reference to this irish land question they had always had the practical sympathy and help of irishmen living in england and scotland to support them in their struggle at home but they had not until recently met with a desire on the part of englishmen to thoroughly study this land question it was exceedingly difficult for englishmen and scotchmen to understand a question which was outside of their own country and it had always appeared that it was more difficult for englishmen to do justice to ireland than perhaps to any other nation in the world laughter and cheers in the first place they had a powerful educated class in ireland the irish landlords and all their dependents hisses who were interested in misinforming public opinion in this country upon irish questions and hence it happened that whenever there was an irish movement they had to struggle against every form of misrepresentation the irish land league had had to struggle against those influence and one of the reasons he was present that night was to explain the position that the irish land league had taken up on this question and to explain the difference between that position and the position taken up by mr gladstone the other night now in order to explain this difference and also the land bill he should have to go back a little he should have to go back to the land act of this act for the first time admitted that the irish tenant had some kind of property in the land some kind of property derived partly from the old history of the land question which in the old days before the english conquest of ireland gave the tenant a joint ownership in the land with his chieftain that joint ownership was also derived from the fact that the irish tenant had made the land of ireland worth what it was and if they took the natural and original value of the land before it had been made by the tenant and his predecessor in title it would amount to very little indeed he regretted that he had mislaid his figures and he should therefore be obliged to speak from memory sir william petty estimated years ago that the land of ireland was worth an annual rental of about the annual rental that the landlords now exacted from it amounted to nearly sterling hisses and cries of shame so that during these two centuries the value of the land in ireland if they laid aside the increased value which resulted in the diminished purchasing power of money the value of the land in ireland had been increased by the exertion of the tenants to the extent of nearly sterling annually that of course was an exaggerated estimate because as he had said it was necessary to take into consideration the fact that the purchasing power of money was vastly diminished and that consequently also the value of the land was increased it was however sufficient for his purpose to have shown that the progress of the value of the land in ireland had enormously increased during these two centuries by the exertions of the tenants this was the chief claim and foundation for the tenant right or interest in his holding of the irish tenant and it was this tenant right which the land act of sought to protect by legalising what was called the ulster custom in the north of ireland and by providing that if the landlord ejected his tenant in other parts of ireland he should pay him compensation for doing so it was admitted on all hands that the land act of had proved a total failure in protecting this tenant right and that the rents had increased in the ten years succeeding far more than they did in the ten years preceding and now mr gladstone came forward with his bill of for the purpose of attempting further to protect this tenant right or interest of the irish tenant well the national land league believed that as regarded the very large number of the irish tenants certainly the greater number of the smaller tenants this attempt of mr gladstone would be a failure hear hear they pointed out that no successful examples existed of the working out of a system of joint proprietorship in the land that if they looked to the examples followed by other countries where feudal tenure formerly existed and where as a substitute for that they attempted to establish a system of joint proprietorship they would find that that system failed and they were obliged to purchase out the landlords and make the tenants the owners of the soil applause the believed it would be better and quicker for mr gladstone to go to the root of the question and adopt the principle of compulsory expropriation however the prime minister preferred to try and establish this joint proprietorship to try and protect the interest of the tenant and the way in which he proposed to do this was by establishing courts for the purpose of fixing what a fair rent should be as it had been proved by the working of the land act of that the intention of that act was defeated owing to the landlords arbitrarily raising their rents well these courts unfortunately for mr gladstone plan were the courts which had the working of that act of and it was mainly owing to their defective composition and the unfair way in which they dealt with all the claims brought before them by the irish tenants that this land act of proved a failure they saw therefore that as regarded the machinery provided by this bill of they were confronted at the very outset with the fear that the courts to which would be intrusted the working of the act would not deal out equal justice to the irish tenant hear hear they were composed of the class from whom the landlords were taken well it was found also that a very large number of the tenants in ireland one half of them were very small tenants out of the which this bill proposed to protect in their tenant rights there were valued under the yearly rental of sterling and of these there were valued under the yearly rental of sterling it would therefore be seen that more than half of these tenant farmers were very humble men very poor men to whom the legal proceedings necessitated by this bill would be exceedingly expensive they had first of all to apply to the county court asking that court to fix a fair rent they had to prove all the improvements in the land made by themselves or their predecessors in title during a long course of years many of these improvements were hidden there were in the shape of drains or unexhausted villages or manures and these small tenants had kept no account and it would be exceedingly difficult for them to prove any of these improvements before the court then they would have to employ solicitors and counsel for the purpose of arguing their case properly before those courts for of course the landlords who were rich and powerful would employ counsel to beat down the case of the tenant and whittle away his tenant right as far as they could they would also have to call skilled witnesses to state any of their improvements and to value them and after all the expense and uncertainty inherent in this one sided court they had the prospect of a further appeal to two other bodies a sub commission the main commission he supposed sitting in dublin they would thus see that these small tenants rented many of them at a year and the majority of them at were still to have to go through this expensive legal proceeding for the purpose of trying to defend their poor tenant right in their little holding cheers now what was the condition of these small tenants they were sunk in debt they were in debt both to the landlords and many of them to the shopkeepers these people were in debt either to the landlords or to the shopkeepers in the case of those who were indebted to the shopkeeper they had borrowed money from him either in the shape of food or in the shape of direct cash advances for the purpose of paying the landlord impossible rents and in the case of those who were indebted to the landlord they had been unable to pay those impossible rack rents since the commencement of the distressed seasons they had had in ireland since but these small tenants to entitle them to have the protection afforded by the bill must pay up the arrears of rent to the landlords and their debts to the shopkeepers after doing that they would only be entitled to sell their interest in their holdings a mocking offer because there was nobody to buy their interest in their little holdings at present ireland had just passed through a season of famine and great depression capital had disappeared from the country and the class of persons who at other times would have bought their little tenant right had either emigrated with what money they had or had no longer any money to invest in the purchase so they found that these small tenants under this bill of mr gladstone were offered a mockery for it was nothing more they must apply to a court and go through an expensive course of litigation and be compelled to pay the arrears of rents to the uttermost farthing before they could claim the benefits to be derived from that bill applause it was possible that the larger class of tenants who had money to spend in litigation would be able to obtain a reduction in their rents under the provisions of the bill but he very much feared that they would not obtain a suitable reduction and that the result might be on the whole disappointing but he was convinced as regarded the smaller class of tenants as it was utterly impossible for them to pay that the bill would not afford them the slightest protection nay more it would prove their destruction and it was evident that the government in introducing it had a gigantic scheme of emigration in their mind with regard to these small tenants hisses they saw that evidenced in the statement with which mr gladstone moved the first reading of the bill and they saw it in the two royal commissions which had inquired into the question of land tenure and recently reported to the house of commons they saw that the government desired to rid ireland of these small holders and they actually proposed in their bill to advance money out of the imperial exchequer for the purpose of migrating those men with their wives and families to some of the british colonies hisses and cries of shame this was a blinking of the real question the land in ireland was very remarkably situated after the famine the people were cleared off all the rich lands which were turned into vast grazing tracts and they were driven over to america or england or on to the bogs and hillsides in the west of the country on these bogs and barren places the population was undoubtedly congested it was too crowded together and the people according to all evidence were unable to live on their small and poor holdings but in every irish county where there was a congested population on these bogs and barren places there also existed an abundance of improvable land quite sufficient to relieve this congestion without resort to emigration to america applause but they did not even require to have this migration back from connaught because according to the evidence of professor baldwin a government official in ireland before both the royal commissions and professor baldwin had had an opportunity of looking thoroughly into the question there existed in mayo and in all the counties where the population was congested plenty of unoccupied and improvable land for the purpose of settling say one out of every two of the crowded holders upon now what did he say in his evidence before the duke of richmond commission he was asked have you made any calculation as to the number of families who would have to migrate in this manner in order to remedy this congestion he replied i should say that there are small farms that are quite too small and i think if migration to the extent of per cent were permitted it would meet the difficulty and that would be in round numbers or families he went on to say further on my colleague and i are thoroughly agreed upon this that there is about four million acres of improvable land in these various western counties which was once touched by spade labour which was used by peasants before the famine time principally and after the famine time the land went into pasture and it is now rapidly deteriorating this land is really going backwards and it is doing so on account of the want of a better system of farming i would describe this land not as waste land but as semi waste land and it is a class of land to which i think it would be desirable to migrate the people it would be more suitable for the purpose than waste land then again in another part professor baldwin was asked as to the amount of money which he thought would be necessary for the purpose of migrating these families and he said he thought it could be done for about two and a half millions sterling that if these lands were bought from the landlord and they could be bought for a very low price about an acre each tenant might be given his own plot of acres or so and might be allowed to build his own little house which need not be of a very expensive or grand description but which would be perfectly suited for his wants and requirements he might be allowed to drain this land where it required draining and to improve it in other ways where it required improving during the first two years and he might be paid by the state during these two years for his work in the shape of piece work so much a perch for drains and so much a perch for the walls and so much a perch for the digging and at the end of two years he might be allowed to settle down on his own farm now that was professor baldwin plan the evidence he had just read was given before the duke of richmond commission later on after more careful examination professor baldwin admitted that it might probably be desirable to migrate instead of families and he mr parnell agreed with him and consequently they should be obliged to extend their estimate from 2½ millions of money to about millions of money well this was professor baldwin plan for the purpose of dealing with the great difficulty of settling the land question in ireland namely the gradual deterioration in the first place of a great deal of improvable land and secondly the difficulty that the very small holders found in living on their little plots of land of course if they had of such small holders all or each willing to sell his interest to his neighbour would be sufficient to remove dealing with them in this fashion but there was no doubt that those small tenants would eagerly jump at any proposal of this kind that they would work by day and by night in reclaiming their little plots until they had made them sufficient to enable them to live upon cheers all the evidence they had pointed in that direction there was no being in the world who liked better to work for himself than did the irishman cheers and perhaps there was no being in the world who had greater unwillingness to work for another man as a slave where the result of his labour went to another man cheers but the government in their bill had rejected this plan of professor baldwin they had adopted the principle of emigration and in that way they had earned for themselves the determined hostility of the irish people and their representatives at all events as regarded that part of their measure we cannot mr parnell continued allow these small holders to be banished from ireland we want them all cheers they talk of emigration being the only remedy for irish ills we have had enough of emigration in the past and it does not seem to have done us any good cheers i don't think irish emigration has done the english working classes much good cheers i am inclined to think that it has pulled down your wages very considerably and that it is keeping them down if i had my way with regard to irish land and i speak as a practical man a practical farmer who has studied this question and who has been guided very much by the advice of men like professor baldwin who have also studied it practically if i had my way with regard to the irish land i should work it in such a way as to bring back and find employment for every irish man woman and child who has left ireland and come to england loud cheers in addition to our own population whom they want to migrate as being too numerous the population per square mile of ireland is less than that of any other european country and it is a great deal less than countries like france and belgium where they have developed the system of small ownerships to the highest extent since the famine 2¾ millions of people have emigrated and of this per cent were people between the ages of and seventy five per cent of these people were the flower of our race cheers government desire to shirk this question they won't take the trouble to solve the irish land question it would take a little trouble to carry out this scheme of migration and so they desire to hire some canadian emigration agency to do the work which they ought to do cheers i was talking to you a while ago of the increase in the irish rentals during the last years or so in the estate which is now owned by sir richard wallace in ulster was something like a year i speak from memory in the year it was the increases in rent have been very marked in late years i could quote to you hundreds of instances given in evidence before these two royal commissions where the rents or the tenants have been raised on their improvements since the passing of the act of three and four times over cries of shame they had been raised in they had been raised again in again in in and in these gradual and successive rent raisings came to an end with the formation of the irish national land league cheers let mr gladstone if he wishes to have the support of the irish people for his bill show that he really intends to protect these small holders in their little property he can do it very easily if he pleases hear hear if he fails it will be the last chance that he or any english statesman will ever have loud cheers again and again renewed the conscience of the civilised world will no longer permit those successive famines and those successive depopulations the irish race at home and abroad is too united and too determined to permit any longer trifling with the question we do not want the chicanery of the courts for the purpose of protecting the interests of our tenant farmers their right is founded upon justice and it should not require a law suit for the purpose of ascertaining and fixing it cheers we can point to the way in which this feudal land tenure has been determined and ended in every other country and we can surely ask the liberal england that preaches liberality to all other nations laughter and cheers that annexes islands in the mediterranean because they are misgoverned that engages in a crusade for the autonomy of bulgaria and for the perseveration of the nationality of greece we ask that liberal england shall at last turn her eyes upon suffering ireland and extend to ireland those principles which she has been preaching for the edification of other nations cheers that the right may be given to labour in ireland and to benefit by the result of that labour for after all this irish land question is a labour question and if you do this we promise you on our side that we will make your food a great deal cheaper and that for every pound of beef and mutton and butter we now send you we will send two loud cheers we will keep our people at home so that they may no longer reap the wages of your industrious working classes and perchance the national struggle and animosity which have so long lasted between the two nations may also find some mode of settlement and england and ireland may come to learn that there is some course which may be adopted by both to the mutual and equal advantage of both by which the strife of centuries may be terminated and we may no longer be enemies wherever we meet you cheers if this can be done the english liberal party will have something to boast of up to the present they have simply used this irish question for their own political purposes cheers they have made great professions when out of office but when they have come into power they have been worse in their measures of coercion than the tories cheers now ladies and gentlemen i do not wish to detain you longer i will only add that i feel exceedingly grateful for the opportunity you have given me of addressing you upon this question i trust that at all events some of my words may have thrown some light upon this most difficult subject and that perhaps some of the scotch men amongst my audience will bear away from this meeting the conviction that the irish national land league is not the league of assassins and midnight marauders they have been led to believe cheers\n",

      "mr parnell said it would do the hearts of the struggling tenantry in ireland good to see that magnificent meeting of scotchmen assembled to express sympathy with them he had found of late on the part of englishmen a most intense anxiety to be informed in regard to the land question an anxiety which had not hitherto been manifested one of the reasons of his visit to glasgow was to explain the position taken up by the irish land league and the difference between them and the government it was admitted on all hands that the land act of had proved a failure in protecting the right of the tenant that mr gladstone came forward with the new land bill the land league believed that as regards a very large proportion of the tenants mr gladstone attempt would be a failure there were no examples in other countries of the working of a system of joint proprietorship in land and it was the opinion of the league that it would be better and quicker for mr gladstone to go to the root of the matter and adopt the principle of compulsory expropriation in the land bill they were confronted at the outset with the fact that the courts to whom was to be intrusted the working of the act would not deal out equal justice composed as they were to be of the landlord class the tenants were offered the mockery of a one sided court and after going through an expensive course of litigation they would be compelled to pay their arrears of rack rent before they could claim the benefit to be derived from the bill the larger class of tenants who had money to spend on litigation might be able to obtain a reduction in their rents under the provisions of the bill but for the smaller tenants it would simply be ruin it was evident that the government in introducing the bill had some gigantic scheme of emigration in view in regard to the small tenants cries of shame this in his opinion was a blinking of the question and he thought the remedy lay more in an immigration back to ireland there was plenty of improvable land in connaught and elsewhere and he agreed with professor baldwin in thinking that new families should be migrated for this purpose which could be done at a cost of about five millions of money emigration did not seem to have done any good to ireland so far and the exodus of the irish had not done any good to the english working classes for it had pulled down their wages and kept them down if he had his way and speaking as a practical farmer he would bring back to ireland every irish man woman and child who had gone to england and find employment for every one of them cheers if mr gladstone wished to have the support of the irish people for his bill let him show that he really intended to protect the small landholders if he failed it would be the last chance he or any english statesman would ever have cheers the conscience of the civilized world would no longer permit those successive famines and successive depopulations the irish race at home and abroad was too strong to permit any longer trifling they asked that the liberal government should extend to ireland the principle they were so ready to extend to nations abroad if the irish question were settled it would have wisely beneficial effects for one thing it would make the food of britain a great deal cheaper and increase the rate of wages in concluding mr parnell hoped his remarks would have the effect of convincing the people of scotland that the irish land league was not a body of midnight assassins\n",

      "mr chairman and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to attend this meeting of the farmers in the north of ireland this is only the second meeting which i have had the opportunity of attending in the north of ireland a voice you are welcome mr parnell and when i see the strides which the land movement has made since the first meeting at belleek in the county fermanagh which i attended some few months ago i cannot help wondering at the progress of this movement i do not know of any part of ireland where the principle of the irish land league ought to be more heartily embraced than in the north of ireland cheers you have a great deal to gain by this movement in these parts you are not situated as the people are in the three other provinces where much of the richest land has been taken from the people and where the inhabitants are allowed now to exist only on the very poorest portions of the country but you have the land of the north in your possession and the struggle which the land league has set on foot is to enable you to retain possession of that land on fair terms cheers now the government has brought in a bill to enable you in ulster and the tenant farmers generally throughout ireland to retain possession of your holdings on fair terms the great question we have to decide is does this bill really fulfil the professed objects with which it has been brought in no does it carry out the ends at which it aims a voice no it is only a hoax mr parnell after the exhaustive criticism of the bill which has been given you by my hon friend mr barry it will not be necessary for me to go into it in detail but i would say that the bill provides the fixing of a court for the purpose of ascertaining what a fair rent shall be and upon the action of that court will depend the success or non success of the bill now in estimating the probability of the successful action of the county court in reducing your rents you must consider what this action has been in the past in carrying out the provisions of the land act of has the action of these county court judges or chairmen as they used to be called been favourable to the tenants or to the landlords a voice to the landlords mr parnell i say that in nine cases out of ten the action of the county court judges has been favourable to the landlords and to them is largely due the failure of the land act of in supplying the modicum of justice that it was intended to indecipherable hear hear i don't think i can do better in describing the principle of the principle of the present indecipherable than to read to you a passage from the speech of michael davitt cheers in this county delivered shortly before his arrest he said speaking is called the three f's of which this government land bill is a faint and only a faint imitation he said now i hold that such a measure have been accepted a few years ago but it is now an inadequate proposal buried beneath the strides of irish democracy the appeared now to them the intelligent of down as they did to the rest of the in ireland as dead sea fruits tempt the eye but turn to ashes the lips cheers two of the three f fixity of tenure and the right of free you could accept but i deny that any could be appointed in ireland english house of commons crammed with english and irish landlords that could ever what a fair rent should be the result of this land bill shows the correctness of michael davitt predictions for the government in their bill propose to appoint as the tribunal for the ascertainment of this fair rent this landlord county court and that is the real difficulty of any proposal to maintain the system of landlordism joined with the rights of the tenants the difficulty of finding a tribunal to ascertain what a fair rent shall be i don't believe it is possible to find such a tribunal in ireland a voice it will be done mr parnell the national land league twelve months ago called upon the government to suspend ejectments for two years if they do that now and if they afford suitable facilities for enabling the tenant farmers to become the owners of their holdings i believe that the irish land question would be settled without any court for fixing what a fair rent should be cheers this attempt at fixing a fair rent although it opens up an enticing prospect to the tenant farmer will undoubtedly result to you you will find yourselves sold by the lawyers and handed back to the landlords by the county court a voice to h with the lawyers mr parnell if a really fair rent could be fixed under the provisions of this bill i am entitled to think that landlordism would disappear from ireland in a few years cheers because landlords once deprived of the right of plundering the people would be only too glad to surrender their interests and sell out for the best price they could get cheers but the whole question hinges upon this is any tribunal that the government is likely to adopt is it likely that any such tribunal will give the tenant farmers fair play in fixing a fair rent i don't believe that they will look at those plains and hillsides cultivated hillsides that lie stretched before us i would ask you what was the condition of those fields years ago how much were those lands capable of producing in rent before the tenant farmers came on them and made them worth what they are now a voice nothing at all mr parnell from what i have seen of the condition of the north of ireland i am convinced that if a fair rent was truly fixed it would leave very little indeed for the landlord as his just right cheers but this bill does not really intend that a fair rent shall be fixed for whenever it appears to give a concession on the one hand it takes very good care to take it away on the other hand it is so fenced round with exceptions restrictions provisos sub clauses sub sections and all the machinery of the lawyers that it is utterly impossible for any honest man to see what his right is under it stick then to the lines which have been laid down by michael davitt cheers i don't say that you ought to take upon yourselves the responsibility of rejecting this measure perhaps it would be as well to give mr gladstone and his government a trial and to see whether they are really in earnest in reducing the rackrents of the tenant farmers of ireland i am not prepared to say that if we find we can introduce modifications in it which will prevent this bill from injuring the organisation of the irish tenantry that we may not allow it to be seen what can be done under it if we adopt such a course as that and if the bill fails we can claim the indefeasible right and title to rally the irish people again cheers we can say to the government we have given you your chance and you have done nothing let us try now cheers and we can call upon the people once more to rely upon themselves as they have been doing during those last two bitter years i see every hope and encouragement for the future of our cause a descendant as i am of an officer who crossed the boyne in william army i welcome on this tenant right platform an orange chairman cheers if the land league movement had never done anything else than banish as please god it will banish religious and sectarian dissensions from ulster cheers it would have achieved a great purpose for in the union of creeds in our country in the junctions of the orange north with the catholic south cheers we shall have obtained the surest guarantee for the ultimate gaining of our rights but it has done more it has taught our people self reliance the government land bill is the proof of the fruits of this policy it has taught you the power of combination and organisation of a peaceable attitude of a policy of patience and forbearance of suffering if need be and i congratulate you the people of this great county upon the stand that you are making to day for the principles which the irish national land league has introduced into ireland

      "mr parnell sir i am sorry that i cannot join with the hon gentleman the junior member for the county of sligo mr d o'conor in taking any part in the division upon present stage of the bill and i will endeavour to explain to the house my reasons for my abstention it has been truly said that the debate upon this measure up to the present has been very much a debate upon its details and not upon its principle in fact it appears to me that the gentlemen who have been instrumental in moving the present amendment do not so much find fault with the principle of the bill as they show a desire to fritter away the details in committee so as to render it still more worthless to the irish tenant than in its present form i shall step out of the line which the debate has taken and say why i cannot approve of the bill and try to show my reasons why i think that principle is a defective one it is supposed by many people in ireland that this bill introduces some new principle now i venture to think that this bill introduces no new principle that it proposes to restore nothing to tile irish tenant besides that which the act of proposed to restore for t look liven the bill not as a measure that gives anything but as a measure of restitution now sir the principle of the bill i think is identical with the act of inasmuch as it proposes to establish a partnership in the land between landlord and tenant it is true that for a very long time even the authors of the laud act sic of refused to admit that any property was conferred upon the tenant by that act or that any partnership was proposed to be established so late as last session during the debates on the compensation for disturbance bill the right hon gentleman the chief secretary for ireland was with the greatest possible difficulty induced to admit that the laud act sic of did confer some kind of interest these were his words he would not say property upon the irish tenant but we now have the government coming forward and admitting that the act of did confer a property upon the irish tenant in the shape of tenant right in the north of ireland and in the shape of compensation for disturbance and improvements provided in the scale under that act now the only difference to my mind between the first main portion of this bill and the act of is that this bill seeks to carry out the principle of the act of in a different way from that provided by that act the act of as i have said did really intend to confer a property upon the irish tenant it really proposed to do so but it failed to protect that property it proposed to protect it by lining the landlord for evicting his tenants to the amount of value of property that was so conferred but it was found during the practice and the experience of the years we have had with that act that this system of fining the landlords failed to protect the tenant in that property now i venture to assert though i hope otherwise that the system of establishing a court to fix fair rent will also fail in protecting even the small property acknowledged to belong to the tenant by the act of we have had a great many calculations as to the amount of property handed over to the irish tenant we were told by high authorities that or were to be handed over by that act but we have a very easy means of estimating the amount of money property of value actually transferred by a return which was quoted by the hon member for galway mr t p o'connor the other evening from that return it appears that the compensations which have been given by the county courts in operation under that act during the four or five years time over which the return extended to the tenants in claims both for compensation for disturbance and improvements only amounted to each we thus find that instead of or handed over to tenants by this act a sum which is only an exceedingly small fraction of that amount was actually transferred and this only after expensive litigation before the county courts and sometimes before the supreme courts now in estimating the benefits which this act was to confer upon the irish tenants we must bear in mind that the property which this bill proposes to acknowledge to the tenant is only that which the act of proposed to acknowledge nothing more the only difference is that it proposes to protect it in a different way and this is the great boon which is being held up to the irish people as the reward for all their miseries during the last two years and for all the sacrifices they have made it simply means that an additional value to the amount of is to be handed over to these unfortunate tenants and this is only to be had at the cost of a lawsuit the tenant is not afforded the simple means of even knowing what his right is except by tedious and expensive litigation every step in this litigation may be contested by the rich powerful and educated landlord opposed to him for the time we have then on the one side the poor irish tenant without education without means and until very recently without the power of organization and combination pitted against a class of men who have constantly shown themselves to be the most able defenders of their rights that have existed in almost any country but we have also the authority of the authors of the bill as to the extent of this benefit to the irish tenants we have in addition the declaration of the principal ministers of the crown we have first of all the declaration of the primo sic minister in introducing the bill that the landlords as a rule have stood their trial well and he said he did not propose to interfere with them as a body and that this bill would not interfere with the rents of the landlords as a body mr gladstone except in the case of the payment of excessive rent just so in other words that he did not believe that the rents of the majority of irish landlords would be in any way reduced we have also the statement of the right hon gentleman the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant to the same effect he stated that he believed that a very small minority of irish landlords would be affected in any way by the measure we have also the statement of the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the other night when he said that the bill would not reduce the rents of more than one tenth out of the whole body of irish landlords and certainly if i am entitled to assume and anybody can predict what would be the result of the work of this complicated measure i am entitled to assume that the three right hon gentlemen who are responsible for this measure know more about its probable working than any other member i now ask the hon member for the county of cork mr shaw who is doing so much to lubricate the larynx of the irish people in order to induce them to swallow this bill amended or unamended as best they can i ask him whether he considers anything but a very large and general reduction of rent in ireland will be or ought to be satisfactory to the irish tenants the house will be good enough to recollect what the situation is there have been three years of unexampled agricultural depression an almost total failure of crops when foreign competition has come into play in a most unusual and unheard of fashion we have compelled the irish landlords to reduce their rents during the last two years the english landlords have reduced their rents of their own accord because they were wise in their generation but the irish landlords allowed the question of the reduction of rent to be made a casus belli between themselves and their tenants and have produced an agitation of which i believe none of us have yet seen the end well the right hon gentleman comes forward with his voice and says that as regards the bulk of the irish landlords their rents will not be in any way reduced i ask the hon member for the county of cork how he can conscientiously recommend a measure of this kind to the irish people as a satisfactory settlement of this great question while he hears these statements from three right hon gentlemen of such authority we have been accused of being desirous of keeping up the agitation for my part i think the accusation would fit very much better upon her majesty government i know of no better way for keeping alive the agitation than by supplying half remedies for admitted grievances we desire this question to be settled now once for all and it is because we have every reason to believe that this measure will fail in affording the satisfactory and final settlement that we refuse to allow ourselves to be compromised and allow the claims of the irish tenants to be compromised by the flat and full acceptance of the bill which the prime minister so much desires let it not be supposed that because we live in ireland we desire to keep our country in a state of agitation can it be supposed that we who have some cause for desiring the interests of our country to prosper and chat it should return to quietness should gain more by the continuance of irish grievances grievances to be redressed by liberal ministries grievances out of which they may gain party victories on election hustings without which it is much to be feared that liberal ministries would sometimes find their occupation entirely gone i know of no period within a great many years when the irish question has not been adopted by the liberal ministry when this question has not been carefully fostered and cherished and a sufficient instalment of justice given fur sic the purpose of keeping it alive and i as an irishman protest against the present government losing this opportunity an opportunity which they may never have again of closing this question and certainly it will not be my fault so far as anything i can say or do if they lose it now sir the attempt to establish a partnership between the landlord and tenant between idleness and industry is to be renewed by the government after they have failed in their attempt of to establish it and the miserable restitution of upon the average is to be offered to each irish tenant as his share in the soil of his native land this miserable dole is to be again foisted off upon him by a liberal government as his reward aild sic as his share in the exertions which he has made and which his predecessors have made for many generations in improvement and reclaiming the soil of ireland recollect that the tenants have done everything and that the landlord has hardly done anything we were told the other day of the magnificent sum of sterling which the irish landlords had spent upon improvements since but it was out of the tenant pocket it ought to be remembered that all that money has been borrowed from the board of works and that both principal and interest have been repaid by the tenants in the shape of added rent but that very accurately represents the so called exertions of the landlords and it came out of the pockets of the tenants it has been exceedingly easy for landlords to borrow money they can do so much more easily than landlords in england now the annual income from land in ireland was sic or and the irish landlords only pretended to have spent they have had the land of their country absolutely under their control no foreign despot ever wielded more power over the good of the people and over the resources of the country than the irish landlords and they have left us in an appalling and miserable state ireland is the worst cultivated and worst formed and the most miserable country on the face of the earth evidence of this is to be seen on every hand yet because we have asked that the land which has been the absolute property of this privileged class for so many centuries and which they so shamefully neglected should be transferred to the only people that have ever done anything to improve it we are to be charged with being revolutionists and with a desire to confiscate we do not desire to confiscate anything the land league doctrine is that ally attempt to reconcile the respective interests of the landlord and tenant is impossible it is time after the prime minister has made an ineffectual attempt to deal with the question and when he is entering upon another attempt which we fear will also prove ineffectual it is time that the doctrine we preach should be thoroughly examined and that it should be entertained with a little more tenderness and regard fur sic the just claims of the irish people how has the land league proposed that the existing system in ireland should be put an end to we have never asked for the expropriation of the landlords oh oh and the hon member for the county of galway who is the chief propagator of that delusion is taking upon himself a grave responsibility when he holds out finch an agreeable prospect to the irish landlords the members of the land league do not think the property of the landlords has yet touched bottom and are of opinion that they should not be caught out until more is known of the change which american importations are likely to produce but the league has undoubtedly recommended compulsory expropriation though not for all landlords we have recommended that power should be given to a commission to expropriate compulsorily those landlords who may be acting as centres of disturbance to use the expression of the first lord of the treasury that is all that the league has recommended up to the present time in the shape of compulsory expropriation we have asked that the price to be paid to those landlords who have broken the trust reposed in them by the state should be fixed at years purchase at the poor law valuation and we believe that the mere threat of expropriating them at such a price would do more to reduce rack rents than all the legal paraphernalia of the right hon gentleman and his draftsmen we have also asked parliament to restore to the tenant his old common law right which was taken away as the right hon gentleman has told us by the act of before which date ejectment was a difficult matter the league last year had recommended that ejectment should be suspended for two years and it appears to me that the essential way in which to effect their suspension would be by repealing the enactments passed by landlord parliaments in favour of landlords in the years and another restitution which ireland may fairly claim from england has been already alluded to by the first lord of the treasury who has told the house that the worth of property sold in the encumbered estates court has been sold without any regard to the interest of the tenants but did it not occur to the right hon gentleman that if this great wrong had been done it would be fair to undo it and that there would be no hardship upon a landlord who had purchased in the encumbered estates court if he were asked to give up his purchase upon receiving what he had paid for it if the land were to revert to the state at the price paid for it in the encumbered estates court the tenants would have their property in the soil protected and they could remain as state tenants under the government or could become landowners by the process indicated the other night by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster is too large a sum of money for this country to spend upon this irish question the money i feel sure can be got by a loan at per cent in the open market several irish members three per cent if parliament can but summon up courage to undo the mischief that has been done a great deal of good may be effected without any necessity for such complicated legal machinery as is now proposed among the landlords who have purchased the large amount of property to which i have just alluded will probably be found a very large proportion of the worst and most rack renting i do not mean to say that rack renting is entirely confined to the new landlords for i know many absentee landlords and many old landlords whose estates are just as highly rented as those of the new landlords but there is a very large proportion of rack renting landlords among the latter and they are the curse of their country having said thus much upon the fundamental principles of the measure and upon some points which i venture to think may assist the solution of the question before us i will pass on to a very brief consideration of some of the more striking details of the measure and show how impossible it is for the irish tenant to hope that this bill will really give him even the small amount of property which the first lord of the treasury proposes to restore to him how i ask is this little property of to be secured to the tenant the tenant cannot be considered as the owner of that property until he shall have successfully wrested it from the landlord every point in his case is liable to be contested in a court of law every right which he claims may be subjected to modification and the onus of proof is thrown upon him from the first he will have to pay for skilled witnesses to give evidence as to the improvements on his holding he will have to engage counsel and solicitors and if finally successful he will get it should be borne in mind that the majority of tenants are very poor men and very small holders out of tenants in ireland were valued under the yearly value of and of these are valued under these figures show how useless it will be for many tenants to hope that they will gain anything from the measure under consideration the costs of the suits will in nine cases out of eat up all the profits which the tenant can expect to gain the old proverb of the shell for thee the oyster is the lawyer fee will have to be modified if the bill were to become law for a tenant will have the shells while his landlord and the lawyer will divide the oyster between them i am however happy to say that the right hon gentleman has given up the idea of the county court as the tribunal of first instance under the bill it is true that the right hon gentleman has rather shabbily covered his retreat by throwing the blame upon the draftsmen i desire however some statement in reference to this question of the court for we are still ignorant of what the composition of the tribunal will be from the statement of the prime minister with regard to the draftsman of the bill it appears that he was prepared to allow tenants the option of going past the county court and applying directly to the commission i presume then that he would have to substitute a great number of sub commissioners this announcement must have whetted the appetite of the multitude of office seekers who are hanging around this bill and who are looking forward to its results with far more hope than the unfortunate tenants i presume he would appoint a large number of sub commissioners to fix what the fair rents should be and for the purpose of deciding all the other points which are left to the court to decide now that is one of the chief defects of the bill incident to the principle as well as to its detail it is practically impossible in an agricultural country like ireland where there is no other resource than agriculture to find a tribunal which will not be prejudiced either in favour of one side or the other for the purpose of deciding those questions all the educated classes from whom you would most likely draw your sub commissioners will be either landlords themselves or their relations or in some way under their influence and in favour of the maintenance of the landlord system in its full integrity i pass on now to the question of arrears of rent and i would say that it was worthy of more than the passing notice which the prime minister gave it there is an overwhelming accumulation of evidence in the reports of both royal commissions as to the indebtedness of the tenants both with regard to arrears rent to their landlords and debts to the shopkeepers you offer nothing in this bill that you did not offer the tenant in the small bill called the compensation for disturbance bill last year you do not in fact offer him so much because you only give him the right of his interest and you gave him the prospect at all events of something more under that bill in the shape of compensation for disturbance you do not give him the opportunity of remaining in his holding and of enjoying the reduced rent which you hope the court may in some cases fix you simply give him the right of selling his interest in order to discharge the arrears of rack rent which have accumulated during the past three bad seasons to the landlords considering as i have said that these small tenants in arrear constitute the majority of the irish tenants i think we are entitled to make a strong stand in behalf of the interests of those unfortunate people the government evidently see that their bill affords no protection to the small tenants for they have made a very strong point of the emigration clauses as the real remedy for their case the prime minister and his colleagues have said that they do not hope to remove the congestion in the west of ireland by any other means than by emigrating the people in families it is admitted on all hands that the congestion which has existed in many parts of the west of ireland must be got rid of somehow or other the tenants are crowded upon poor and small holdings where it would be difficult for them to exist in decent comfort if they had no rent to pay at all i would ask the government to take these small tenants under their protection to place them under the protection of the commission and not to doom them to banishment it is impossible for these poor people to be happy in america i have seen many of them in america i have seen them on the land i have seen them in the cities and they are not happy and they are not contented passing their lives in the west of ireland and many of them having arrived at au advanced age they are not fitted to undertake the troubles and the struggles of a new world such as america is young people when they go out there thrive well and can assimilate themselves to the new phase of existence which they have to commence but to carry out these poor old men and women amid to set them down upon the prairies of minnesota or iowa is indeed a very poor mockery of english justice to ireland the example of what was done by falter nugent of liverpool and by bishop ireland of st paul was quoted during some of the discussions upon this bill as sic showing the advantages of emigration father nugent emigrated some selected families from the west of ireland sent them over and placed them under the care of bishop ireland father nugent is a remarkable judge of character and i will only say of bishop ireland that if he could not make emigration succeed no other man is likely to do so but with the exception of two or three families all those families have proved failures as emigrants and the colony which bishop ireland established last year had to be broken up and the people scattered in different directions i would ask the government to look into this matter emigration is simply a short cut for them it is simply an evasion of the responsibility which rests on their shoulders they desire to shift the duties which belong to them as the responsible government of the country upon some emigration agency and at the expense of the british taxpayer we require the labour of everybody in ireland for the purpose of developing the resources of our country we have plenty of land i have been accused of wanting to migrate them from the plains of mayo to the fertile fields of meath i believe once in the united states i was guilty of an oratorical flight of that nature but it was only an oratorical flight there is no practical necessity for bringing the people from mayo to meath there is plenty of improvable land in mayo for everybody there the gardeners chronicle says there are acres of land laid down in pasture in ireland which are not fit for pasture and which is every year deteriorating and becoming less capable of producing food i should like to give the commissioners power by way of experiment to buy land in the neighbourhood of these congested districts under the lands clauses consolidation acts and to transplant the best of those tenants if they desired it and i am sure they would upon those lands and give them a chance of cultivating some of this improvable land and making it produce what it is capable of producing the adoption of this course with regard to some tenants would remove the crowded condition of things in mayo donegal and one or two other western counties and we should produce a great deal more food for the english market i believe if you get or of the people on to these grazing tracts which are not fitted for grass and ought not to be left one instant longer in grass i am not speaking of the rich grazing lands which it would be a mistake to break up but land capable of improvement and in want of labour i believe we could give these poor people some chance of making them productive i ventured the other night to make a suggestion in that direction to the government i suggested the commission should have the power of buying land for the purpose of building decent labourers houses and allotting half an acre or so to labourers wherever it was found they were not already provided for however i was at once pounced upon by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and a lecture in political economy was read to me which i shall not soon forget we were told that that was the sure way to bring about a return to the condition of the old 40s freeholder that if you gave the irish labourer land he would try to live upon it and would refuse to work for the farmers in his district the right hon gentleman i think answered his own speech in another speech he subsequently delivered on the land bill far more effectually than i could have answered it the right hon gentleman had shown that the small cottier tenants in the west of ireland tenants holding not more than from half an acre to five or six acres are migratory labourers in the habit of migrating every year to england or wherever they can get employment they took their labour to the best market and worked very hard in their employment the right hon gentleman had eulogized with all his well known eloquence the industry and energy of these poor people people who come to england and scotland every year and live on 6d a day working very often or hours a day for the purpose of paying the rack rent exacted from them for their little holdings at home by the landlords i would ask the right hon gentleman then if the migratory labourers of the west of ireland holding their five or six acres of land or more than the half acre which has been spoken of are not prevented from working and working very hard to better their position why should he suppose that labourers in other parts of ireland with much less land given them would be prevented from working as the right hon gentleman had suggested in his first speech on this question i feel convinced that if the labourers were rendered independent on the one hand of the landlord and on the other of the farmer if he were independent to the extent only of his small house and his little garden plot the quality of his labour would be much improved and he would be contented with his lot a stimulus would be given to his industry in the shape of the hope of in time becoming possessed of greater property in that way a fresh incentive to industry would be held out to the agricultural labourer of ireland i do not think the question of the agricultural labourer could be settled by meddling with the farmers or by insisting upon the latter building houses or improving the labourers little plots i would put the labourer under the protection of the commission just in the same way as i propose that the smaller tenants should be put under it and if the commission were formed of men who would not shrink from trouble of gentlemen such as i now see on the opposite side of the house some englishmen and some irishmen i feel convinced that the result would be an enormous improvement in the condition of the labourers throughout ireland and a material diminution in the amount of disaffection that at present unfortunately exists among the lower classes of ireland you cannot expect that the people will be contented as long as they are starving at any rate before you apply the remedy of emigration try the other plan namely the development of the resources of the country and i will undertake to say you will not be disappointed in the result the right hon gentleman the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster has asked why are there no industries why is there no enterprize sic in ireland it is not very difficult to find the reason the irishman has been trained to the knowledge that the result of his labour will not accrue to him he has learned that that also has been the experience of his fathers before him and he has come to the conclusion that the less capital he lays by and invests in the land or anything else the better for him and the less is he at the mercy of other people we cannot have industry in a country without a spirit of enterprize sic enterprize sic comes from hope and the irish people have no hope go amongst them and see how listless and despondent they are go to america and see what irishmen are there they have made the railroads they have built cities and irishmen are to be found there distinguished in every walk of life they are to be found as employers of labour as manufacturers and as professional men we know that fulton the inventor of the steamboat was the son of an irishman we know that roche the great shipbuilder and mackey flood and o'brien the most successful miners that exist are all true born irishmen here is an example of irish enterprize sic when i was in cincinnati a short time ago mr holland an irishman took me over his shop and presented me with dollars and a gold pencil case in aid of the land league mr holland emigrated some nine or ten years ago from the city of cork as a poor boy who found that he could not get on in his own country i found him employing hands in the manufacture of gold and silver pencil cases and sending his goods to manchester paris and other places successfully competing with other manufacturers i saw that mr holland had just made a discovery which promised to make a revolution in electric lighting he has discovered how to fuse the metal iridium which has hitherto been considered to be infusible and has so supplied the want of an electric burner now the reason the irish do not succeed in ireland is because a nation governed by another nation never does succeed under such circumstances communities lose that feeling of independence which to them is just as necessary as to individuals in order to promote exertion the curse of your rule of foreign rule in ireland overshadows everything the conduct of her majesty government during the past few months has been leading many moderate men to believe that until your chief secretaries and under secretaries your privy councillors and your central boards your stipendiary magistrates and military police your landlords and bailiffs are cleared out bag and baggage there can be no hope of any permanent improvement of the country i think sir i have said enough to snow why i ought not to compromise myself or those whom i represent by accepting a measure which i fear cannot be either a final or a satisfactory solution of this question i regret very much that the government appear determined to miss the great chance which is open to them i believe that if they had adopted a different course had they permitted remedial legislation to precede coercion they would have found a very much stronger feeling in this country behind them and that they would have been enabled to have carried through this house and also through the other house a much stronger and more perfect bill i hope the result will prove that i am wrong in my forecast as to the effect of the bill no one hopes more sincerely than i do that the measure will turn out better for the irish tenants than i fear it can as i have said i and my friends have no desire to keep things in a perpetual state of confusion we desire to see this land question and every other irish question settled we desire to see this division amongst the classes which i fear some englishmen desire to perpetuate for their own purposes done away with we do not want the irish landlords and the irish tenants continually to live in opposing camps as individuals the landlords are well fitted to take their place as the leaders of the irish nation they have been placed up to the present time by legislation in a false position and they would have been more than human if they could have filled it without shame and disgrace i would entreat the government to re consider the question and to endeavour in committee to make the measure more healthy for the poor people and less hurtful and to bring about such improvement in it that we the irish members may vote for it without feeling that we are compromising the position we have hitherto occupied and sustained\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with enthusiastic cheers supported the resolutions he said they were assembled at an unexampled crisis of the history of ireland and he ventured to think of the history of great britain to demand that the armed forces of the government should not be used to enforce unjust evictions in ireland cheers the government asked how were they to know what were just and what were unjust evictions and they said that many of the irish tenants while perfectly well able to pay their rents refused to pay them the government know perfectly well that they could obtain that information from the constabulary authorities if they were in ignorance but he considered that they were fully aware of which were the just and which the unjust evictions cheers they knew as well that the vast majority of the three thousand tenants who have been sentenced to eviction at the last quarter sessions in ireland are tenants unable to pay the rent demanded of them hear mr forster hisses and groans and cries of boycott him at the close of the last session said that he would carefully watch the action of the landlords and the character of the evictions during the winter which was then coming and he promised that if he found that the landlords were to any extent exercising their right of eviction and compelling the government to assist in the infliction of injustice that while asking parliament for exceptional powers against the people he would accompany that request with some kind of a bill to stop such evictions cheers he went over to ireland and he fell under the influence of the permanent officials of dublin castle hisses and when parliament re assembled in the month of january he asked for coercion but he did not ask for power to protect the tenant the consequences were as he reasonably knew they must be that the landlords encouraged by coercion are bringing on a conflict between the people and the government in ireland cheers irishmen now called upon the english people to step in and to tell the government that they would not have the troops paid for with their money employed in the support of injustice in ireland hear hear the other day military and police were sent to a place called doon near new pallas in the county limerick for the purpose of assisting an absentee landlord named colonel hare of devonport in england to evict his tenants the english press or at all events the metropolitan press represented to the people of this country that this man hare had always lived on amicable terms with his tenants until the formation of the land league and they said it was owing to the land league that he had fallen out with his tenants and was compelled to evict them and that man hare was represented as a just landlord he mr parnell held in his hand a letter he had just received from farther o'donnell the catholic curate of doon and what was the account it contained of colonel hare relations with his tenants this landlord who according to the english press was such a very excellent one father o'donnell said colonel hare during the last twenty five years has evicted from his property consisting of thirteen or fourteen hundred acres something near eighty families of four hundred and fifty individuals cries of shame the bailiff on the property named hayes when carrying out some of those evictions had one poor man named mcinerney who was in fever dragged out on the roadside and he cause mcinerney wife to be tied to a car and carried in this manner to doon a distance of two miles shame and hooting this poor woman became crazy and it was her habit to curse hayes on her knees before the people assembled to hear mass on sundays oh oh he wished to point out that this colonel hare was the man for whose support in evicting his tenants and in securing rack rents on his estate nearly fifty per cent over the government valuation according to father o'donnell the english people were being taxed in order to send him armed assistance groans mr forster renewed hisses and the government said they did not know who were the unjust landlords it was a mockery to say that the government could not ascertain the history and the doings of a landlord like colonel hare the government had leagued themselves with the irish landlords and they were dragging the liberal party to destruction at their heels in support of an odious and infamous territorial system cheers the irish members had asked that evictions should be stopped and the responsibility which would rest on the government if they did not take some such measure would be a serious one he was convinced that it was for the interests of the irish landlords that the unjust ones amongst them should not be permitted any longer to inflict injustice cheers they were told that only a minority of irish landlords were unjust he did not believe that but it was the statement of the government mr bright had said that only one tenth of the irish landlords were unjust and that the government land bill would put a stop to their power to commit injustice but these unjust irish landlords were taking time by the forelock and were clearing their estates before the land bill could drag its slow length along cheers in the meantime the people were being brought into conflict with the government which was being discredited simply because its power was being used to support injustice let the government make their laws just before they enforced them and they would find that no people would more readily obey them than the people of ireland but they could not be expected to stand by silently while their wives and children were being cast out of their homes and their roof trees torn from over their heads hear hear the irish people had been very patient they had been too patient cheers but they were now becoming aroused to a sense of their position to the power that combination and passive resistance gave them it was impossible to enforce an unjust law against the whole of the community and he called on the government while there was still time before this question being beyond the chance of settlement by any government not to reject the offer made to them to settle it while the opportunity presented itself with due regard to the fair rights of both landlord and tenant prolonged cheers\n",

      "mr parnell who was received with great cheering and waving of hats and handkerchiefs said after referring to the statistics of the emigration and remarking that most of the people leaving ireland every year were those of the middle classes who could afford to emigrate the resolution which i have deals with the question of evictions and i have been talking so much about evictions during the last twelve months that it is a subject that i should be very glad to have done with for ever cheers it is a subject of enormous importance to the vast number of poor men women and children who are hourly expcting sic eviction and you know that eviction in ireland means a sentence of starvation hear hear we are told that the larger proportion of those evicted are able to pay their rents if they choose to pay them last year the government brought in a bill called the compensation for disturbance bill on the plea that there were evictions during the first six months of the year and that another evictions might take place in the next six months as you are aware mr gladstone told the house of commons that those evictions would mean a sentence very nearly akin to a sentence of starvation what has become of these fifteen hundred persons whom mr gladstone brought in a bill to save from this sentence as you know that bill was thrown out by the house of lords and mr forster rather than lay aside his office and salary or confess himself a failure went over to ireland for the purpose of assisting landlords in carrying out these evictions hisses the land league was also formed or rather extensively organised through the country at the same time for the purpose of protecting those poor people against these sentences of starvation hear hear we were so far successful that we prevented the landlords by the force of public opinion and not by terrorism and intimidation as mr forster has falsely represented from evicting out of families whose eviction mr gladstone had anticipated cheers during the last six months of they turned out of their homes about families mr forster however was disappointed at this result in other words he was jealous of the land league because they had succeeded in doing what he and mr gladstone undertook to do and were unable to do cheers he accordingly vowed vengeance against the land league because they had saved those or from sentence of starvation cheers parliament was called together early in january for the purpose of passing a coercion bill which he said would enable him to assert the law of the land and put an end to the terrorism of the land league well it has enabled him to assert the law of the land but it has not enabled him to put an end to the land league cheers a voice the land league will put an end to him cheers and laughter mr parnell what happened since he so far humbugged parliament as to obtain this bill from them on the supposition that it was directed against dissoluble ruffians and scoundrels by a parliamentary return i find that during the first quarter of the year families have been evicted the evictions have in fact increased or per cent over the first quarter of last year before the government and the landlords obtained coercions are we not entitled to suppose that of these families there are many whom mr gladstone attempted to save last year by the compensation for disturbance bill from a sentence of starvation and yet mr forster tells the house of commons and the english public with unblushing audacity that the great majority of those persons are able to pay their rents but that they were unwilling to do so hisses the powers which the government have placed in the hands of the landlords have been used most remorselessly and would be used more unscrupulously but for the extended and fearless organisation of the irish national land league cheers we shall be told that a great measure of justice and concession to the irish people is now occupying the attention of parliament if it were so we should most willingly admit it all irishmen desire to see the land question settled cheers we desire to see it settled once and for all and it is because the bill of the government lacks this element of finality it is because it leaves the land question an open sore that we have refused to make ourselves responsible for this measure and to allow our position and that of the irish people to be compromised by it although we have offered no obstruction or opposition to it cheers why is this measure unsatisfactory in the first place it has not settled the question for it is liable to be reopened every fifteen years in the second place it does nothing for the class of tenants who are unable to pay their rents for whose benefit the compensation for disturbance bill was brought in last year the land bill does less for the class who have suffered so much than the measure which was thrown out by the house of lords that measure dealt with the question of arrears of rent the present bill does not the bill is also a very complicated one no single right can be obtained by the tenant without an expensive legal proceeding and each point can be disputed by the landlord now a measure which does not provide a simple means for the irish people to obtain justice is a mockery a delusion and a snare cheers in the third place and this is the great difference between the land league and the government the question is not settled finally once and for all it is liable to be reopened every fifteen years when the tenant statutory term is finished it cannot be accepted as a settlement that the question as to the amount of rent to be paid by the tenant to the landlord shall be perpetually kept on recollect the history of the land question in ireland the landlords were placed in ireland centuries ago and have lived at enmity with the people ever since and they look to england for the maintenance of those unjust powers they have remained there at enmity with the people from that time to this and the cause of that war is that the landlords have claimed excessive rents and the tenants have fought against them but the landlords are still left to claim their excessive rents now at the end of fifteen years we shall have the whole question raised again we think that the least to be done is that the rents of the tenants should be definitely fixed once for all and not be liable to come up as a source of dispute again in our country but the government understands that so long as they can maintain a landlord class in antagonism with the rest of the people so long will they be able to poison the minds of the english masses with false stories of agrarian outrages now as to the establish tear in page makes several words indecipherable league a short while ago a rumour was spread about that the irish land league was to be forcibly suppressed meaning that the secretaries treasurers and officers of the thousand and odd land league branches throughout ireland would be seized and put into prison if they ventured to persevere with open organisation only two courses would then be open either that the land league organisation should be turned into a secret organisation cheers or else that all attempts at organisation should be given up all of us who were engaged in the movement felt that we could not recommend the irish people to betake themselves of any secret organisation our officials all over ireland were willing to go into prison and to fight the battle out openly and within the lines of the constitution but we could not recommend the irish people to betake themselves to secret organisation as regards this land movement the ladies then offered that in the event of all the branches of the men organisation being suppressed they would carry on the organisation as an open one until mr forster had summoned up courage to put them in prison also in this way we should probably have been enabled to have prolonged the fight for several months after the organisation had been suppressed up to the present moment although every indirect attempt has been made by arresting the most experienced members no direct attempt has been made to suppress it as an organisation cheers and therefore the full measure of usefulness of the ladies land league has not yet come into operation up to the present they have amply confined themselves to looking after evicted families and taking care of prisoners and i for my part shall be very much pleased if the government spared them the necessity of assuming any wider and more extensive functions than those that have been necessary up to the present moment mr redmond told you that the cause of ireland was very hopeful that is so i do not think anybody can look back and recall a time when the cause of ireland appeared to be so near the goal of success as at the present moment the sympathies of the thirteen millions of the irish race in america are now practically enlisted on behalf of their mother country cheers that is of great importance to the success of a movement such as ours in fact i have reason to believe that that is the chief difficulty which the government feel in dealing with it the irish in america will be perfectly satisfied with whatever programme the inhabitants of ireland may settle upon the policy of the irish land league was the policy of abolishing irish landlordism not necessarily this or next year but whatever we do should be done for the purpose of effecting that object as speedily as possible we should not attempt any compromise in the way of continuing the present system in america they would have been satisfied with a programme to abolish absentee landlords but the land league decided that their goal must be the abolition of irish landlordism and nothing that has happened since that platform was fixed upon has lessened our belief in the practicability and the near practicability of achieving that result we believe it is possible to abolish irish landlordism we believe it is possible to abolish irish landlordism we believe we can get the irish tenants to refuse to pay unjust rents and to refuse to take farms from which other tenants have been evicted we ask your help in this great struggle it is exceedingly difficult to establish a healthy public opinion in england on any irish question it is one of the penalties which the english people have to pay through their undertaking to govern another nation cheers the money of the working men of england is being used at the present moment to inflict frightful cruelties upon the very poorest class in ireland i acquit the people of this country of any intentional desire to do wrong as regards the government of ireland but no nation ever had sufficient knowledge to govern another nation cheers i think it would be very much better for the english people to consider how they can settle the whole of this question the land bill cannot be a permanent or a lasting settlement of it it will be only the cause of further disputes and bad blood between the irish landlords and irish tenants and your government whether liberal or conservative will be again used for the purpose of upholding the landlords in their unjust rights i say your government because i do not think it matters very much whether a conservative or liberal ministry is in power for the purposes of self defence i should prefer a tory rather than a liberal government hear hear experience has shown us that the liberals when out of office help us to prevent the conservatives from obtaining coercive powers and experience has shown also that when the liberals come into office they united with the conservatives to coerce ireland therefore as far as coercion is concerned it is absolute protection to ireland to have a conservative government in power mr parnell then entered into a lengthy contrast of the policies of both governments with respect to ireland denouncing in strong terms the unexampled severity and remorselessness of the conduct pursued by the present ministry he did not at all view with apprehension the accession of the conservatives to power and in view of a general election which might occur at any moment he would advise his fellow countrymen who had made such unexampled exertions to return the present liberal government to power to remember father sheehy loud cheers michael davitt great cheering and john dillon renewed cheers and to execute justice upon the authors of the coercion acts of the land league would not change one single inch from their platform they felt confident they could carry it in its entirety and they asked the irish people at home and abroad to have confidence in them and to trust in them that if they had been able to bring the question to its present position they should be able to carry it to a successful and glorious ending cheers\n",

      "i have come to speak to you about a practical matter in a plain way i have come to ask you to put your county in line with the rest of ireland at this election for a representative i am glad to say that by my coming i have succeeded i hope in saving the land league of tyrone from a great disgrace hear hear and cheers a disgrace that would have made michael davitt ashamed that he was the author and founder of the land league of tyrone applause the disgrace of the support by the land league of a whig and ministerial candidate i shall put this issue before you in a plain way and with plain words the rev harold rylett has come forward to represent your county as an irish nationalist cheers he has come forward to oppose the government candidate thomas dickson and he has come forward to oppose the representative of the old dead government colonel knox groans whether is colonel knox the representative of the dead government or thomas dickson the representative of the living coercive government the most dangerous there is an old saying that a living donkey is more powerful than a dead lion and so the present living government and its representative thomas dickson is more dangerous to the liberties of the people of tyrone and of the people of ireland than the old dead government and its representative colonel knox applause now i shall prove this to you you know that when mr gladstone came into power at the commencement of the session which has just passed by he brought forward coercion acts for ireland of unexampled stringency and he carried them through the house ah says mr dickson but i will vote for the release in sic the prisoners i am opposed to coercion much good mr dickson voting for the release of the prisoners will be now that they are in prison he should have done his best when they were out of prison to keep them out applause and what was the action of mr dickson son whom we may reasonably suppose acted under the direct inspiration of his father who now seeks your votes what was the action of mr dickson son in reference to this question of coercion mr dickson practically effaced himself in the house of commons on the question of coercion on the bill which was falsely named the protection of person and property ireland bill mr dickson voted eight times for coercion and eight times against it groans so that for all the good he was he might just as well not have been there then again on the arms bill a bill by which many of the tenants farmers of tyrone have been deprived of their right to keep a gun in their houses for the purpose of shooting birds which eat their crops on this bill mr dickson did not vote at all so that on this measure also you will see that it would have been as good if mr dickson had never existed well then again coming to the later part of the session when after many of your countrymen had been in prison for six long months i moved a resolution declaring that the action of the government in arresting these men had been contrary to the pledges which the government gave when they were obtaining these coercive powers mr dickson and the whole of the section or clique who call themselves the ulster liberal members went off home and deserted the cause of the prisoners with one exception namely dr kinnear hear hear and cheers before my friend says hear hear for dr kinnear i should be obliged to him if he would allow me to tell him what dr kinnear did on that occasion laughter dr kinnear on that motion of mine the liberal member for a northern county the county donegal i believe deserted the prisoners went over to the government and voted with the government in favour of the continued imprisonment of our friends groans coming to my next and final motion for the session a resolution which i have moved declaring that that noble hearted patriot davitt the founder of the irish national land league and the saviour of the lives and property of thousands of his fellow countrymen declaring that davitt ought to be liberated i found that even dr kinnear on that occasion had the grace to absent himself and go home and we had not a single one of the ulster liberal members supporting me on that motion in favour of the release of michael davitt groans so much for the contention of mr dickson and the ulster liberal members that they have opposed coercion i say they have not opposed coercion a voice right sir cheers mr parnell they have winked at coercion and it was their traitorous desertion of their pledges which primarily enabled the government to pass these coercion acts through the house of commons now let me go to another matter by the parliamentary returns which were lately issued i find that the evictions in the north of ireland that is to say within the province of ulster have been nearly three times as numerous as in any other province now what is the reason of this we formed the irish national land league eighteen months ago to save the tenant farmers from eviction and to obtain for them a suitable and fair reduction in their rack rents that movement prospered exceedingly in connaught in munster and finally in ulster and we succeeded notwithstanding coercion notwithstanding the crowbar brigade of the present government notwithstanding the buckshot and the bayonets of forster and gladstone groans we succeeded in practically putting an end to eviction in the other three provinces and we obtained for the tenant farmers of those provinces very large abatements in their rents amounting in the aggregate to fully five millions of pounds sterling applause we came to the north of ireland i went to beleek sic in the fermanagh and i founded a branch of the irish national land league there michael davitt penetrated still further into the north but immediately the government saw that michael davitt was going to found the land league in the north of ireland to save the tenant farmers from eviction and to get their rents reduced they arrested michael davitt and no voice was raised by the ulster liberal members to protest against the arrest we invited the co operation of thomas dickson in forming this land league and thomas dickson and his whig following refused to co operate and did everything they could to obstruct us and the penalty that you the tenant farmers of ulster are paying to day for the maintenance of this whig ulster clique is that for every eviction that takes place in each of the other three province sic you have had three evictions in the province of ulster and you have obtained no abatements of any king of the rack rents which are pressing upon you if the ulster whigs had cordially co operated with us in the formation of the land league instead of obstructing us we could have obtained for you an abatement in your rents and we could have saved those hundreds of families throughout ulster who have been pitilessly thrust upon the road by the government of whom thomas dickson is a supporter now i am told by some that it is impossible if mr dickson stands and if mr rylett also stands either mr rylett or mr dickson can be returned well we have made this very fair offer to mr dickson we have said to him since the result of your candidature is to return a conservative it will be better for you to retire and so avoid splitting the popular ranks and dividing the liberals of this county up to the present mr dickson had refused to retire but time is pressing and it remains for you the tenant farmers of the county tyrone to show unmistakably that you are determined to secure the return of mr rylett and so induce mr dickson to retire in time applause we have made another offer to mr dickson we have said to him if you will join the national irish parliamentary party and take your place in the house of commons facing and in opposition to a coercive government with the rest of the irish members well then we shall be very glad to retire in your favour hear hear but failing this it is our duty to stamp out whiggery in the north of ireland applause whiggery is to day your living enemy just as in the old times toryism was your living enemy toryism is now dead it died with lord beaconsfield applause it can never be revived again never and what we have to confront to day in practical politics is the coercive and dragooning whiggery of the present government applause we go to the poll we give an opportunity to every consistent nationalist and liberal in this county to give an honest and consistent vote we say to you we are not afraid of the tories they cannot hurt us now but we are afraid of the whigs and this is a great opportunity for showing ulster whiggery that there is no place left for it in any constituency in the north of ireland applause union is strength the motto of the present irish parliamentary party is independent opposition to every government which refuses the national rights of ireland while on the one hand we shall join the government in the passage of any remedial measures that they may bring forward for the benefit of either the people of ireland or the people of england on the other hand we are bound to show by our independent attitude in the house of commons that there exists a party in ireland which represents on the floor of the house the undying aspirations of the irish people for the right to make their own laws in ireland applause now of what use is the persistence of this ulster whig clique in forcing themselves upon the people of ulster they number altogether only some half dozen every man of them is looking for a government situation they are not independent they will take any office that may be offered to them and they will simply use your suffrages for the purpose of elevating themselves into place and power a voice they will give us buckshot and bayonets mr parnell the principle of lucas is the principle of the irish party of to day that no member of the irish party can take any place or office from any english government cheers we will wait until it is in the power of the irish people to give us place and office cheers we will wait until england has returned the stolen rights of ireland to her people until england has restored to the irish people the right of rewarding her own members hear hear and though we may have to wait till the head of the youngest amongst us grows grey we shall remain in independent opposition to every english government refusing place and office harassing that government on the floor of the house of commons and in every constitutional way until they find out that it is more expensive and more troublesome to keep ireland than to let her go loud applause we offer you at the polls an opportunity of proving how many of the people of ulster are in favour of independence on the part of her members we ask you to show that you recognise the exertions by day and by night that we have been making for you for eight long months applause that you appreciate the sufferings and the sacrifice of davitt dillon and father sheehy cheers a voice and yours mr parnell whom a sacrilegious and tyrannical government have double locked within their jails sacrifices which have advanced the cause of ireland more in two years than it had been advanced in the previous eighty which have elapsed since the union we ask you to signify your appreciation of the exertions of men who have been leading the van in this fight and to show by your verdict in returning harold rylett to represent you for this county that you are willing to send us back to our arduous duty with that practical encouragement and sympathy which it is in your power to give at the present moment loud cheers\n",

      "mr parnell every man that has a home fellow countrymen i am very glad to have an opportunity of addressing this influential meeting of the farmers and labourers of this neighbourhood i have come to ask you to return harold rylett at the head of the poll next week and i have every confidence in recommending him to your support because since he has been in public life in ireland he has proved himself a worthy soldier he has not shrunk from the post of danger and he has undertaken whatever duty we have asked him to perform with courage energy and ability applause what has been the duty that harold rylett has been performing in the north of ireland during the last eight months he in common with many other members of the land league has been helping evicted tenants he has been trying to stay the hand of the evictor and he has been bringing succour to their families when they have been cast out upon the road he has been endeavouring to oppose the progress of eviction in the north of ireland and he has not shrunk as i have said from standing by his post stoutly two or three months ago the government whom thomas dickson is supporting signed a warrant for the arrest of harold rylett groans why because harold rylett was helping evicted families four or five or six months ago michael davitt came into the north of ireland cheers and he preached the gospel of the land for the people he told you that this land had been made for you and not for the landlords when the government whose supporter thomas dickson is heard this they said we must arrest michael davitt we must not permit the people of the north of ireland to hear the truth and they sent michael davitt back to portland prison groans so in the same way with my friend john dillon cheers and with patrick joseph sheridan cheers immediately john dillon came into the north of ireland to tell the truth to the people he too was arrested there were some evictions going on the tenants were very poor they were utterly unable to pay the rent for their little holding which was undoubtedly two or three times a rack rent two or three of these families were turned out without the slightest remorse mr sheridan was sent by the land league to bring these people into the nearest town to give them some food and the next day he was arrested by the government who supporter this sham liberal thomas dickson is these are some amongst the many reasons why we ask you to help the land league to oppose the coercive and imprisoning government in the north of ireland i saw here a very short time ago a very handsome sergeant of police i will engage the sergeant had some buckshot in his pouch laughter it is not any fault of his that he is obliged to carry buckshot i am sure the police would much rather not be engaged in such bad work but we know that last year under the present government the police were compelled by the orders of the government to fire upon the people and to kill the people in dungannon in this very neighbourhood groans and we say that men who come and ask the people of tyrone for their suffrages and at the same time vote for the use of buckshot as dickson did in the house of commons this session are not worthy of your suffrages no let me go to the land question to explain to you the difference between the principles of the land league and the principle of thomas dickson and the government with regard to this land question do you see those fiends unclear up there i don't think i could have a better practical example of the difference between our principles and the principles of the government on this land question just look at those fields on the side of the hill there covered with corn and crops how much do you suppose the land was worth originally before it was reclaimed from the mountain side it has probably been reclaimed within the memory of some who are standing here was it the landlords that reclaimed the land cries of no or was it the tenants cries of the tenants i think it would be a long time before you would find a landlord to go up the mountain side for the sake of reclaiming those fields and of cropping the heathery hillside hear hear well what is the rent of the land to day a voice some of it an acre and some of it mr parnell i was going to say that i suppose the landlords were charging 10s an acre that land was originally before it was reclaimed worth about 6d or 1s an acre and we say that wherever the tenant has made the land what it is he is entitled to the value of the land cheers and this landlord is entitled certainly to nothing more than the original value of it before it was reclaimed hear hear the government land bill will fix the rent of the land for fifteen years i am told the rent is an acre whether it be or 25s the government land bill will fix the rent of the land perhaps at a few shillings an acre less than it is now but that will be a great consolation to the tenant farmer that instead of having to pay 25s he may have to pay 22s 6d for it and the landlord gets all the sterlings all the benefits from the tenant industry which has converted the land from heath into smiling corn crops is there any reason or justice in permitting the landlord to have 25s an acre for the land which the tenant has made what it is the land bill that we wish to see brought in is a land bill that will give the landlord whatever he has put into the land and will give the tenant whatever he has put into it cheers and we feel confident that if such a land bill as that were brought in and carried that instead of the landlords getting seventeen million pounds sterling a year of rent from ireland they would not be entitled to more than one or two millions at the very outside applause how much money have the tenant farmers paid for the land of ireland since the union the rental of ireland is seventeen millions to day we will take one third of that as the probable average rental of ireland since the union we will say that the average rental of ireland since the union has been five million of pounds sterling a year five millions multiplied by eighty gives four hundred millions of pounds sterling as the amount of money that the tenant farmers of ireland have paid to the irish landlords a large number of them absentees during these eighty years groans and if you allow things to go on for another eighty years how much will you pay we will say that this land bill at the very outside will reduce the rental of ireland two millions some people think it will not reduce it at all but we will say it will fix the rental of ireland at million a year if you allow things to go on as they are the tenant farmers of ireland and their descendants will have paid in the next years twelve hundred millions for the right to live on their own land and for the right of cultivating land that they have made like the side of yonder bill what it is and which would not have the slightest value were it not for their exertions they will have paid a sum equal to twelve hundred million of pounds sterling during the next eight years for the right to live in their own country hear hear they will have paid a sum equal to twice the national debt well now the irish national land league thinks that it is time not absolutely to put a stop to all this because we cannot put a stop to it all in a minute but to commence putting a stop to it applause and we believe that we shall be able to do this if we can succeed in combining the irish people into one solid phalanx applause if we can succeed in organising you and getting you to maintain your organisation we believe that we shall be able so to act upon the public opinion of the world of england that we shall secure for the irish tenant farmer that he shall have his land at such a price as will enable him to feed and clothe his family respectably and pay his labourers good wages and to build comfortable cottages for them to pay his debts to the shopkeepers and to the bankers in case he borrows money from them to enable the trade of the country to be revived to give proper support to the languishing manufacturing industries of ireland and in fine to do that which only a self governing people are able to do when they own the soil of their own native land applause a government land bill that aims at leaving the landlords all the plunder that they have succeeded in exacting from the farmers up to the present moment that does not compel them to disgorge at least one half of their ill gotten goods such a bill is a fraud a cheat and a mockery such a bill is merely a shifting of the of the load from one shoulder to the other and although it is right and proper for us to take the land act which has been passed during the last session of parliament and to extract whatever grains of wheat there may be amongst the chaff yet on the other hand it is our bounden duty to take care that the people of this country shall not be deceived by the gifts from england they have not done us far more harm than good you recollect the hopeful promises that were held out when the land act of was passed you the tenant farmers of the north of ireland thought you had got something and you went to work upon your farms and you improved your holdings made two blades of grass grow where one had only grown before and what was the consequence in three or four years the landlords seeing the improved condition of your holdings came round and said oh this land is mine and you must pay more rent and the rents went up in every direction and the people went out and to day you have three evictions in this province for every one in the other provinces groans now thomas dickson the whig government candidate says that he has always been a friend to the tenant farmers and that he is deserving of their support on that account thomas dickson may have been a friendly man to the tenant farmers he may have helped the tenant farmers where he could and may have joined this northern tenant right party for the sake of obtaining some amelioration of your condition but if the land question had been left for its settlement to thomas dickson and all the other ulster whigs you would have had to wait for another eighty years before you would have seen it take the position it has taken in eighteen months owing to the exertions and sufferings of michael davitt and the other leaders of the land league cheers the trouble with regard to the position of the ulster tenant right members is that while they are working for the tenant farmer they are also working for themselves they are not independent of the government and the motto of our party is independence of every english government i do not care whether it it sic whig or tory which refuses to concede the just rights of the irish people applause your late representative was a tenant righter but he went into parliament in order to obtain a government situation and the advantage of the farmers was secondary with him to his own advantage he has got a situation worthy a year i believe he spent upon the last contest it was a very good expenditure thomas dickson who now seeks to get into his place is also another place hunter he applied for the commissionership mr litton got and he would have taken it if the government would have given it to him he will undoubtedly if he obtains this seat obtain also after a few years some other situation from the government again we find another of your northern members mr givan is to get a situation as a reward for his support of coercion and his subserviency to the present government and so it goes on all along the line the main reason why the tenant farmers case has advanced so slowly is because it has been supported by men who are not independent of the government men who are seeking places for themselves and who are not sincere in their professions consequently it happens whenever any great agitation arises in ireland these whig government supporters and place hunters try to wrap it up in a wet blanket and so it was with the land league movement in the north of ireland the land league movement spread all through the other provinces like wild fire and we succeeded in obtaining abatements for the farmers of munster leinster and connaught during the last two years amounting to fully five millions of pounds sterling we succeeded also practically speaking in stopping evictions when we came to the north we were obstructed by thomas dickson and the other north of ireland whigs who tried to wrap us up in a wet blanket and consequently we have not had the success in the north of ireland that we have had in the other provinces the result of that is that there have been three evictions in the north of ireland for every eviction in the other provinces we call upon you to sweep away these obstructionists at the last election it was a contest between whig and tory because the tory government was in office you did quite right in turning the tory government out of power but having got rid of the tories we have got to bring this whig government to a sense of its position the late government is dead and buried and can never come to life again so you need not be in the least alarmed about that the people we have got to fear now are the people who supply my friend the sub constable yonder with the buckshot that he has got in his pouch laughter they are the living representatives of a power that is opposed to the interests of ireland we seek for ireland the right to govern herself and we can only do this by stopping the corruption and place hunting that is going on in the north of ireland we have succeeded in chasing the whigs out of the other three provinces we now come to the north and ask you to help us in chasing whiggery out of ulster also cheers now gentlemen i think i have put a very practical case before you i have shown you in the first instance that we want you to vote for harold rylett as a protest against coercion against the imprisonment of men like john dillon michael davitt and father sheehy hear hear in the second place i have shown you that it is to your interest to vote for a party that has gained considerable advantages for you in the past in the shape of this land act and that undoubtedly will go on and continue to your considerable advantages in the future and thereby i have shown you that it is your duty to vote for harold rylett because harold rylett represents the undying aspirations of the irish people for self government applause we never can hope for really just laws until we obtain for irishmen the right of making those laws on irish soil applause we are driving home the lesson amongst english politicians every day and the cause of self government just like the cause of the tenant farmers has made enormous strides during the last two years i fully believe that the time is fast approaching when orange and green being united protestant and catholic having laid aside their old animosities advancing together with a belief in the future of ireland and with a desire to benefit and help each other burying all old sectarian notions which have been planted in this country simply for the sake of maintaining english rule and landlord robbery putting aside all the old evil tradition recollecting that we are only irishmen deserving to live at peace with one another and to live at peace also with the nations of the world and even with englishmen and england there is no reason we should not live at peace with england if england would give us out just rights having formed such union as that which i have sketched out we shall obtain for ireland the last great right of all the right of making laws for ireland on irish land loud cheers gentlemen i ask you to give three cheers for harold rylett and down with whiggery in the north of ireland renewed cheering\n",

      "gentlemen the telegrams which have just been read to you will make evident the opinions and feelings of our exiled countrymen beyond the atlantic and i think the magnificent gathering which i see around me is a very fair indication that the spirit animating the people of ireland does not fall short if indeed it does fall short of the spirit which animates our countrymen in america it is worth feelings of pride that i look around me and although we miss many faces many well remembered faces who were present with us at our last convention although our ranks have practically speaking been decimated by the action of the government although we miss from amongst us faces of men like brennan cheers and kettle cheers yet we also see that for every one who has been taken from us ten ay a hundred have eagerly pressed forward to fill his place cheers and this convention is a sign to the government of this country and to the civilised world that when the irish nation are branded as a nation of dissolute ruffians and of village tyrants groans and hisses we are also prepared to show in the light of day publicly what stamp of men our people are composed of and who our country chooses as her representatives here and if we have to congratulate ourselves on the position which this movement has obtained during the few short years of its existence we also have to thank ourselves the determination of our people the organisation which they have so practically carried out for the results we have obtained up to the present moment and that for the first time in our history no attempt has been made to thank any english minister any english statesman for the position in which we find ourselves to day resolutions gentlemen will be brought before you dealing with the national question also with the land question and the cognate questions of the protection of labour and the development of the industrial resources of ireland it has been thought best that the resolutions which are thirteen in number should be moved and seconded in globo italics it will then be permitted for each county to select two or three speakers to speak in reference to these resolutions and if they think proper to propose any amendments or additions to them the question of self government stands first on the list and it is a most important one and one which this convention could not for a single moment have lost sight of i believe that we never could settle the question of irish self government so long as the question of how much rent the tenant should pay to the landlord remains in dispute hear hear so the landlord remains in dispute hear hear so long as this land question is not finally settled so long as it is left open it will prove the continuous sources of discontent and of strife between classes in this country and i have not the least doubt that the government of england in proposing a land act which must leave the question open which settles nothing which leaves it even if we were to accept the land act to the very fullest extent which leaves this land question to be periodically open and re opened every fifteen years i believe the government in proposing such a measure had as their object that ireland that classes in ireland should be kept divided hear hear and that we should be thus prevented from utilising our united strength for the purpose of obtaining our lost rights of legislating for ourselves cheers in my opinion then the national question cannot be settled as long as any irish tenantry pay rents to irish or english landlords michael davitt truly saw that the first step to be taken towards the recovery of our legislative independence our right as the resolution expresses it to national self government should be the abolition of landlordism and the irish tenant farmers invited at the very threshold of this land act to assist the people of ireland in recovering these rights and not to allow themselves to be drawn aside by one single inch from the great task of regaining their right to make laws for ireland upon irish soil the land act settles nothing it leaves everything in an unsettled condition to be a continual source of contention between the landlords on the one side and the tenants on the other applause but we have certain principles principles which we have tested and proved the value of by the experience of the last two years which will be an invaluable guide for us in regard to our future conduct whatever the tenants do under this act let them do it unitedly cheers as a body and as one man renewed cheers avoid isolated action cheers let no tenant on any estate be satisfied until all are satisfied cheers the land act was undoubtedly intended to break up organisation to produce individual even sectional contentment while the grievances of the great mass of the tenant farmers and of the people of ireland were still left unredressed hear hear it is for us to be on our guard against these hidden designs of the government designs which have been frequently pointed out to you and which are patent in every line and in every section of the land act of one of our resolutions warns the tenants to make applications to the court as sparingly as possible hear hear to wait until the result of the test cases which may be taken by the executive of the league shall have been ascertained and to make their applications only in consultation with local branches and in consultation by those branches with the executive of the land league hear hear we should insist and i know that this convention will as the result of its deliberations insist that our union will not be broken up cheers that on the contrary it shall be increased and consolidated and that it shall grow from day to day cheers you would be the verist fools if you allowed yourselves to be scattered now just as you are entering on a prospect of success cheers our principles also demand that rent shall be abolished cheers recollect that the act which invites you to enter into statutory engagements lasting for fifteen years may see you stranded long before those fifteen years are up and that as far as you accept the invitation to enter into those statutory engagements to contract longer than you can possibly help so far you violate the principles of the league and go contrary to the principles of your founder michael davitt loud and continued cheers avoid then statutory terms or any engagements to pay rent for any period longer than one year hear hear by the act rent is not to be charged on the improvements of the tenant but by another act and the interpretation to which the lawyers through the reading of that other act i refer to the act of place upon those clauses cheers the improvements in reference to which the tenant is not to pay rent only date back i think for a period of about thirty or forty years and consequently as regards the great majority of the improvements made upon land in ireland the clause becomes to a certain extent illusory but i am informed by my legal friends that the limitation of this improvement clause or section takes place in this way by the act of the presumption that improvements were made by the tenant only extended to a limited period i think a period of something like thirty or forty years behind or further back than that period it was necessary for the tenant to prove his improvements in order to obtain the benefit from them hear hear now of course this necessity for proving improvements which were made by the tenant forefathers rendered it impossible for the tenant to claim credit for them hear hear because from the nature of the case from the fact that he has kept no accounts no books and no records of his improvements it is impossible for him to prove that which is past the memory of man hear hear and hence it happens that the onus of proof in respect of all improvements further back than this period of thirty or forty years is thrown upon the tenant hear hear and as this condition follows the act of the result is that the tenant in order to obtain exemption from rent in respect of improvements made further back than this period of years will have to prove those improvements hear now it is perfectly impossible for him to do so and one of the improvements that we shall have to contend for in the shape of legislative reform will be that the presumption in respect of past improvements improvements farther back than this period of thirty years shall be changed and that as the landlord cannot prove that he has made the improvements all the improvements of land from time immemorial shall be credited to the tenant who as we all know has made them hear and applause while on this question i would wish to read for you an extract from a speech delivered by mr bright during the passage of the recent act he says if all that the tenants had done were swept away off the soil over nine tenths of the land of ireland would be as bare of houses and gardens and fences and cultivation as if it was in pre historic times hear it would be as bare as an american prairies where the indian now roams and whether the foot of the while man has never trod hear hear and then he went on to say i believe i am within the mark in saying that nine tenths of all that is to be seen upon the farming land in ireland of houses farms fences and whatever you call cultivation and bringing land from the wilderness nine tenths of it has been put there by the labours of the tenantry of ireland and not at the expense of the landlord applause this land act which mr bright and his government have just passed hands over about one tenth of the improvements to the tenant and it leaves the remaining nine tenths to the landlords hear hear it will be our duty to struggle until the legislature of great britain has sanctioned the restoration of this nine tenths of the valuable improvements of which mr john bright spoke in his speech hear hear the bill as it it sic was originally introduced in the house of commons contained a definition of fair rent but that question was such very difficult one that the government were obliged to drop it like a hot potato laughter and the act as it now stands does not attempt to define what a fair rent means now i would venture to do that which the act does not attempt my definition of a fair rent would be that the original value of the land before it was improved by the tenant or his fathers be the rent of the landlord and not one penny more hear hear and applause this definition of fair rent would enable the farmer to feed and clothe himself to feed and clothe his children and to educate them hear hear and lastly it would enable him to pay his debts which i am sorry to say in the great majority of cases he does not do now and after all that had been done it would enable him to give a fair rent to his landlord which instead of amounting as the present rental of ireland does to something like seventeen millions would on my definition of fair rent amount to something like two or three millions hear hear when therefore we have secured for the irish tenant the value of the improvements which he and his predecessors in title have made in the land of ireland and give to the landlords the original value of that land before it was improved we shall not have much trouble in dealing with the landlords hear hear a resolution several resolutions with reference to the condition of the labourers will also be brought before you i regret exceedingly that the act has done so very little for them in fact the whole labourers question is so very much entangled that it is very difficult indeed to see what satisfactory attempt can be made under the present law to improve their condition or materially better their prospects i may say that the attention of the executive has been particularly directed to this question that we have during the last few days spent many anxious hours over its consideration and that we are very fully sensible that the result of our labours as shown in the resolutions which will be placed before you in regard to the labourers is very much to be desired the principle which i sought to have established in the act is that the labourer should be independent so far as house and garden plot are concerned of either landlord or tenant hear hear this in my opinion is the true principle there is no reason why the labourer should be put under the tenant as his slave hear hear as a sort of adscriptus glebæ italics as is proposed by the present act the only advantages which the present act confers in the shape of direct advantages i mean i shall refer to the indirect advantages later on which in my opinion are very much more valuable to the labourer than the direct advantages but the only direct advantages which the house of commons has conferred on him is that a small piece of land may be given to him by the farmer and that he is to hold this as a sort of condition of his labour and that he is to be removable at any time at the pleasure of the farmer who employs him this is not a satisfying tenure hear hear and what i and others of the irish members desired to carry out in the act and what we have failed in effecting up to the present was that land should be purchased in accordance with the requirements of the labouring population in different parts of ireland and that the labourers should be given an opportunity of settling down upon these lands and that a comfortable house should be built for them upon these lands and that they should own these houses as owners and not as tenants to anybody this would have taken the labourers out of the towns and placed them near their work and in a healthier atmosphere hear hear and in every way it would have been a more satisfactory solution of the question than the terms that have been made in the act and in the way of giving the farmer the right of renting small plots of land and small houses to his labourers but we have failed to effect that and we must look forward to the introduction of the county government bill in the next session or some early session of parliament for the purpose of enabling county boards to be established under the provisions of the bill with power to buy land in different parts of ireland for the benefit of the labouring population hear hear the indirect benefit which may result from the land act to the labourer may however be very large under the act a most important reform has been effected the tenant farmers are now for the first time permitted to borrow money from the government for the purpose of improving their farms now this privilege has hitherto been confined to the landlords and it has not been used it has been possible for the irish landlord to borrow money for almost any purpose and i am told that only a sum of three millions of money has been borrowed for the improvement of the land in ireland during the last thirty years to the tenant farmers of ireland this privilege has been extended and i trust that they will show by taking advantage of it during the coming winter by borrowing money in every direction for the purpose of improving their holdings and giving employment at remunerative wages to the labouring population that they are worthy of holding the land of ireland cheers the land of this country is in the occupation of the tenant farmers by the 31st section of the land act farmers can now borrow money at ½ per cent interest this is a very valuable privilege and i trust that you will use it and that we may not have during the coming winter the spectacle of starving labourers hear hear going about the country in hands seeking for work which they cannot get and becoming a charge on the rates in the shape of outdoor or indoor relief hear hear it will be the fault of the tenant farmers of ireland if any man who is willing to work is left without work during the coming winter cheers a voice down with the poorhouses the chairman bear in mind that if you do not assimilate the labourers cause to that of the tenant farmers there are classes in this country who will be on the watch to do so the landlords are simulating an interest in the welfare of the labourers which they do not feel hear hear and they have extended many temptations to them to forsake the cause of the farmers the labourers of ireland to their credit be it spoke have manfully and in face of cruel starvation in the face of cruel sufferings last winter withstood these temptations they have stood by you and it will be for you to return the benefit they have been to you and to stand by the irish labourer i deprecate all separate organisation on the part of the irish labourer hear hear i would ask the labourers to join the local branches of the land league hear hear and i pledge myself to them here to day and of the local branches and their arrangements with respect to labour and the employment of labour throughout the country if the farmers don't give the labourers fair play that after we have tried joint organisation between the farmers and the labourers and we find that that joint organisation is a failure i pledge myself to take my stand at the head of a labourers movement applause and cries of bravo do not let us be divided hear hear i am convinced that no necessity exists for division on this labour question and that the farmers will give fair play to the labourers applause it is a matter of self interest that they should do so no badly paid or starving man ever could work well or give a fair day work and it will be to the advantage of the farmers to pay their labourers well and house them comfortably and make them contented happy and prosperous applause vast tracts as regards the future of semi waste land exist in all part sic of the provinces of leinster munster and connaught these are lands from which the tenantry were evicted after the famine of these lands stand badly in need of cultivation and i should hope in the future that we may obtain legislation which would enable us to get our labouring population on to these lands applause i was very much struck with the difference presented by the north of ireland in this respect everywhere through the north of ireland you see the country studded with small farms there are no great grazing tracts such as you have in leinster connaught and munster all the land of ulster is thickly settled and the people cultivate the land themselves there is an enormous amount of tillage as a consequence and a great deal of employment for the labouring population but in the other parts of ireland we see vast tracts of grazing land which are gradually deteriorating which show the need of the labour of the people and one of the commercial reforms that is most pressing with respect to ireland at the present moment is that these tracts of land may be made available for the purpose of producing food for the people of ireland applause let us then encourage the labourers and the farmers to stand together and to behave fairly to each other and i am convinced that the result will be that we shall have no attempt at sowing division or disunion in our ranks hear hear the labourers of ireland as i have already said deserve well of the tenant farmers and i think the farmers ought to stretch every point to meet them that they possibly can the industrial movement will also claim a share of your attention many attempts have been made in time past to establish home manufactures in ireland movements have been started with a great flourish of trumpets but they have always broken down because they have not been taken up by the democracy i hope this movement in favour of home production will be taken up by the people of ireland and the organisation of the national land league applause only such an organisation can make it successful you cannot expect to be able to encourage irish manufactures without paying a little more for them than you would pay for english manufactures you must if you are to make this movement a success you must agree amongst yourselves voluntarily to protect irish industry if we had our own parliament with full powers we should undoubtedly be invited to protect irish manufactures by prohibitive or import duties just as the united states of america and every european country also where industries were crushed in the bud at the end of the last century and the beginning of this by english legislation and english exactions have protected their industry their struggling and infant industries against the settled industries of great britain we should be invited if we had the powers of self government to do the same thing and any movement that we set on foot to be successful must proceed on this principle we cannot by the law of the land declare that irish manufactures shall be protected but we can protect them by our unwritten law loud cheers by the public and organised opinion of the great majority of the people of this country in accordance with which opinions all laws governing ireland ought to be made and if we resolve if we bind ourselves together into an organisation to protect irish industries depend upon it that irish industries will flourish and thrive in ireland cheers but in no other way can you succeed there are indirect methods of protection which may be resorted to such as buying our goods when we cannot obtain them at present in ireland in markets such as the american markets which are protected by special legislation for the purpose that would be a species of indirect protection because it would encourage the formation of manufactures in ireland for the purpose of producing similar articles the great thing in my opinion is to resolve that we shall use no articles of english manufacture whatever cheers buy in any other market that you please if you cannot buy in an irish market and there are undoubtedly many things which are not produced well in ireland or which are not produced at all in ireland these things we ought to buy anywhere but in england renewed cheering and such a course if carried out in an organised and determined way would act as a species of indirect protection for the purposes of encouraging irish industries now gentlemen i do not intend to detain you at any greater length i am convinced that the deliberations of this convention will be conducted with that dignity and that order which is characteristic of irish assemblies when they are elected by the people hear hear let us leave to other gatherings nominated by an oligarchy or self nominated scenes of confusion which marked such gatherings upon even a very recent occasion laughter and let us show by our conduct and action to day that we understand the magnitude of the issues which are committed to us let us cast aside all feelings of self interest and let us act only with the desire to benefit our country to regain for her a place amongst the nations of the world loud cheers even at the cost of present sufferings and sacrifice for ourselves to bequeath to those who come after us a future of prosperity happiness and independence loud cheers the chairman then submitted in their order the first three resolutions in favour of self government in denunciation of the coercion act and declaring that no settlement of the land question can be satisfactory effective or practicable which does not abolish landlordism root and branch and make the tiller also the owner of the soil these resolutions having been carried mr parnell submitted to the convention the fourth resolution that in order to ascertain precisely and speedily the true effect of the land act upon the rental of ireland whilst at the same time preserving the unity and maintaining the strength of the irish national land league the executive be authorised to select at their discretion test cases upon estates in various parts of ireland and cause those cases to be brought before the court\n",

classes in this country and i have not the least doubt that the government of england in proposing a land act which must leave the question open which settles nothing which leaves it even if we were to accept the land act to the very fullest extent which leaves this land question to be periodically open and re opened every fifteen years i believe the government in proposing such a measure had as their object that ireland that classes in ireland should be kept divided hear hear and that we should be thus prevented from utilising our united strength for the purpose of obtaining our lost rights of legislating for ourselves cheers in my opinion then this national question cannot be settled so long as any irish tenantry pay rents to irish or english landlords michael davitt truly saw that the first step to be taken towards the recovery of our legislative independence our right as the resolution expresses it to national self government should be the abolition of landlordism and the irish tenant farmers invited at the very threshold of this land act to assist the people of ireland in recovering these rights and not to allow themselves to be drawn aside by one single inch from the great task of regaining their right to make laws for ireland upon irish soil the land act settles nothing it leaves everything in an unsettled condition to be a continual source of contention between the landlords on the one side and the tenants on the other applause but we have certain principles principles which we have tested and proved the value of by the experience of the last two years which will be an invaluable guide for us in regard to our future conduct whatever the tenants do under this act let them do it unitedly cheers as a body and as one man renewed cheers avoid isolated action let no tenant on any estate be satisfied until all are satisfied cheers the land act was undoubtedly intended to break up organisation to produce individual even sectional contentment while the grievances of the great mass of the tenant farmers and of the people of ireland were still left unredressed hear hear it is for us to be on our guard against these hidden designs of the government designs which have been frequently pointed out to you and which are patent in every line and in every section of the land act of one of our resolutions warns the tenants to make applications to the court as sparingly as possible hear hear to wait until the result of the test cases which may be taken by the executive of the league shall have been ascertained and to make their applications only in consultation with local branches and in consultation by those branches with the executive of the land league hear hear we should insist and i know that this convention will as the result of its deliberations insist that our union will not be broken up cheers that on the contrary it shall be increased and consolidated and that it shall grow from day to day cheers you would be the verist fools if you allowed yourselves to be scattered now just as you are entering on a prospect of success cheers our principles also demand that rent shall be abolished cheers recollect that the act which invites you to enter into statutory engagements lasting for fifteen years may see you stranded long before those fifteen years are up and that as far as you accept the invitation to enter into these statutory engagements to contract longer than you can possibly help so far you violate the principles of the league and go contrary to the principles of your founder michael davitt loud and continued cheers avoid then rent for any period longer than one year hear hear an illusory clause by the act rent is not to be charged upon the improvements of the tenant but by another act and the interpretation to which the lawyers through the reading of that other act i refer to the act of place upon those clauses now known by the name of healy clauses cheers the improvements in reference to which the tenant is not to pay rent only date back i think for a period of about thirty or forty years and consequently as regards the great majority of the improvements made upon land in ireland the clause becomes to a certain extent illusory but i am informed by my legal friends that the limitation of this improvement clause or section takes place in this way by the act of the presumption that improvements were made by the tenant only extended to a limited period i think a period of something like thirty or forty years behind or further back than that period it was necessary for the tenant to prove his improvements in order to obtain the benefit from them hear hear now of course this necessity for proving improvements which were made by the tenants forefathers rendered it impossible for the tenant to claim credit for them hear hear because from the nature of the case from the fact that he has kept no accounts no books and no records of his improvements it is impossible for him to prove that which is past the memory of man hear hear the onus on the tenant and hence it happens that the onus of proof in respect of all improvements further back than this period of thirty or forty years is thrown upon the tenant hear hear and as this condition follows the act of the result is that the tenant in order to obtain exemption from rent in respect of improvements made further back than this period of years will have to prove those improvements hear now it is perfectly impossible for him to do so and one of the improvements that we shall have to contend for in the shape of legislative reform will be that the presumption in respect of past improvements improvements farther back than this period of thirty years shall be changed and that as the landlord cannot prove that he has made the improvements all the improvement of land from time immemorial shall be credited to the tenant who as we all know has made them hear and applause john bright witnesseth while on this question i would wish to read for you an extract from a speech delivered by mr bright during the passage of the recent act he says if all the tenants had done were swept away off the soil and if all that the landlords had done was left upon it over nine tenths of the land of ireland would be as bare of a house and garden and fences and cultivation as if it was in pre historic times hear it would be as bare as an american prairie where the indian now roams and where the foot of the white man has never trod hear hear and then he went on to say i believe i am within the mark in saying that nine tenths of all that is to be seen upon the farming land in ireland houses farms fences and whatever you call cultivation and bringing land from the wilderness nine tenths of it has been put there by the labours of the tenantry of ireland and not at the expense of the landlord applause this land act which mr bright and his government has just passed hands over about one tenth of the improvements to the tenant and it leaves the remaining nine tenths to the landlords hear hear it will be our duty to struggle until the legislature of great sic britain has sanctioned the restoration of this nine tenths of the valuable improvements of which mr john bright spoke in this speech hear hear mr parnell definition of a fair rent the bill as it was originally introduced in the house of commons contained a definition of fair rent but that question was such a very difficult one that the government were obliged to drop it like a hot potato laughter and the act as it now stands does not attempt to define what a fair rent means now i would venture to do that which the act does not attempt my definition of a fair rent would be that the original definition of a fair rent would be that the original value of the land before it was improved by the tenant or his fathers be the rent of the landlord and not one penny more hear hear and applause this definition of fair rent would enable the farmer to feed and clothe himself to feed and clothe his children and to educate him hear hear and lastly it would enable him to pay his debts which i am sorry to say in the great majority of cases he does not do now and after all that had been done it would enable him to give a fair rent to his landlord which instead of amounting as the present rental of ireland does to something like seventeen millions would on my definition of fair rent amount to something like two or three millions hear hear when therefore we have secured for the irish tenant the value of the improvements which he and his predecessors in title have made in the land of ireland and give to the landlords the original value of that land before it was improved we shall not have much trouble in dealing with the landlords hear hear a resolution several resolutions with reference to the condition of labourers will be brought before you i regret exceedingly that the act has done so very little for them in fact the whole labourers question is so very much entangled that it is very difficult indeed to see what satisfactory attempt can be made under the present law to improve their condition or materially better their prospects i may say that the attention of the executive has been particularly directed to this question that we have during the last few days spent many anxious hours over its consideration and that we are very fully sensible that the result of our labours as shown in the resolutions which will be placed before you in regard to the labourers is very much to be desired the principle which i sought to have established in the act is that the labourer should be independent so far as house and garden plot are concerned of either landlord or tenant hear hear this in my opinion is the true principle there is no reason why the labourer should be put under the tenant as his slave hear hear as a sort of ad scriptas glebe italics as is proposed by the present act the only advantages which the present act confers in the shape of direct advantages i mean is that a small piece of land may be given to him by the farmer and that he is to hold this as a sort of condition of his labour and that he is to be removable at any time at the pleasure of the farmer who employs him this is not a satisfying tenure hear hear and what i and others of the irish members desired to carry out in the act and that we have failed in effecting up to the present was that land should be purchased in accordance with the requirements of the labouring population in different parts of ireland and that the labourers should be given an opportunity of settling down upon their lands and that a comfortable house should be built for them upon these lands and that they should own these houses as owners and not as tenants to anybody this would have taken the labourers out of the towns where they are now living many of them in a most wretched state it would have taken them out of the towns and placed them near their work and in a healthier atmosphere hear hear and in every way it would have been a more satisfactory solution of the question than the terms that have been made in the act and in the way of giving the farmer the right of renting small plots of land and small houses to his labourers but we have failed to effect that and we must look forward to the introduction of the county government bill in the next session or some early session of parliament for the purpose of enabling the county boards to be established under the provisions of the bill with power to buy land in different parts of ireland for the benefit of the labouring population hear hear land for the landless the indirect benefit which may result from the land act to the labourers may however be very large under the act a most important reform has been effected the tenant farmers are now for the first time permitted to borrow money from the government for the purpose of improving their farms now this privilege has hitherto been confined to the landlords and it has not been used it has been possible for the irish landlord to borrow money for almost any purpose and i am told that only a sum of three millions of money has been borrowed for the improvement of the land in ireland during the last thirty years to the tenant farmers of ireland this privilege has been now extended and i trust that they will show by taking advantage of it during the coming winter by borrowing money in every direction for the purpose of improving their holdings and giving employment at remunerative wages to the labouring population that they are worthy of holding the land or sic ireland cheers the land of this country is in the occupation of the tenant farmers by the 31st section of the land act farmers can now borrow money at ½ per cent interest this is a very valuable privilege and i trust that you will use it and that we may not have during the coming winter the spectacle of starving labourers hear hear going about the country in bands seeking for work which they cannot get and becoming a charge on the rates in the shape of outdoor and indoor relief hear hear it will be the fault of the tenant farmers of ireland if any man who is willing to work is left without work during the coming winter cheers a voice down with the poorhouses the chairman bear in mind that if you do not assimilate the labourers case to that of the tenant farmers there are classes in this country who will be on the watch to do so the landlords are simulating an interest in the welfare of the labourers which they do not feel hear hear and they have extended many temptations to them to forsake the cause of the farmers the labourers of ireland to their credit be it spoken have manfully and in the face of cruel starvation in the face of cruel sufferings last winter withstood those temptations they have stood by you and it will be for you to return the benefit they have been to you and to stand by the irish labourer i deprecate all separate organisation on the part of the irish labourer hear hear mr parnell pledge i would ask the labourers to join the local branches of the land league hear hear and i pledge myself to them here to day and of the local branches and their arrangements with respect to labour and the employment of labour throughout the country if the farmers don't give the labourers fair play that after we have tried joint organisation between the farmers and the labourer and we find that that joint organisation is a failure i pledge myself to take my stand at the head of a labourers movement applause and cries of bravo do not let us be divided hear hear i am convinced that no necessity exists for division on this labour question and that the farmers will give fair play to the labourers applause it is a matter of self interest that they should do so no badly paid or starving man ever could work well or give a fair day work and it will be to the advantage of the farmers to pay their labourers well and house them comfortably and make them contented happy and prosperous applause vast tracts as regards the future of semi waste land exist in all parts of the provinces of leinster munster and connaught these are lands from which the tenantry were evicted after the famine of these lands stand badly in need of cultivation and i should hope in the future that we may obtain legislation which would enable us to get our labouring population on to these lands applause a striking difference i was very much struck with the difference presented by the north of ireland in this respect everywhere through the north of ireland you see the country studded with small farms there are no great grazing tracts such as you have in leinster connaught and munster all the lands of ulster is thickly settled and the people cultivate the lands themselves there is an enormous amount of tillage as a consequence and a great deal of employment for the labouring population but in other parts of ireland we see vast tracts of grazing land which are gradually deteriorating which show the need of the labour of the people and one of the commercial reforms that is most pressing with respect to ireland at the present moment is that these tracts of land may be made available for the purpose of producing food for the people of ireland applause let us then encourage the labourers and the farmers to stand together and to behave fairly to each other and i am convinced that the result will be that we shall have no attempt at sowing division or disunion in our ranks hear hear the labourers of ireland as i have already said deserve well of the tenant farmers and i think the farmers ought to stretch every point to meet them that they possible can irish manufactures the industrial movement will also claim a share of your attention many attempts have been made in times past to establish home manufactures in ireland movements have been started with a great flourish of trumpets but they have always broken down because they have not been taken up by the democracy i hope this movement in favour of home production will be taken up by the people of ireland and the organisation of the national land league applause only such an organisation can make it successful you must not expect to be able to encourage irish manufactures without paying a little more for them than you would pay for english manufactures you must if you are to make this movement a success you must agree amongst yourselves voluntarily to protect irish industry if we had our own parliament with full powers we should undoubtedly be invited to protect irish manufactures by prohibitive or import duties just as the united states of america and in every european country also where industries were crushed in the bud at the end of the last century and the beginning of this by english legislation and english exactions have protected their industry their struggling and infant industries against the settled industries of great britain we should be invited if we had the powers of self government to do the same thing and any movement that we set on foot to be successful must proceed on this principle we cannot by the law of the land declare that irish manufactures shall be protected but we can protect them by our unwritten law loud cheers by the public and organised opinion of the great majority of the people of this country in accordance with which opinions all laws governing ireland ought to be made and if we resolve if we bind ourselves together into an organisation to protect irish industries depend upon it that irish industries will flourish and thrive in ireland cheers but in no other way can you succeed there are indirect methods of protection which may be resorted to such as buying our goods when we cannot obtain them at present in ireland and markets such as the american markets which are protected by special legislation for the purpose that would be a species of indirect protection because it would encourage the formation of manufactures in ireland for the purpose of producing similar articles the great thing in my opinion is to resolve that we shall use no articles of english manufacture whatever cheers buy in any other market that please if you cannot buy in an irish market and there are undoubtedly many things which are not produced well in ireland or which are not produced well in ireland or which are not produced at all in ireland these things we ought to buy anywhere but in england cheers anywhere but in england renewed cheering and such a course if carried out in an organised and determined way would act as a species of indirect protection a most valuable species of indirect protection for the purpose of encouraging irish industries now gentlemen i do not intend to detain you at any greater length i am convinced that the deliberations of this convention will be conducted with that dignity and that order which is characteristic of irish assemblies when they are elected by the people hear hear let us leave to other gatherings nominated by an oligarchy or self dominated scenes of confusion which marked such gatherings upon even a very recent occasion laughter and let us show by our conduct and action to day that we understand the magnitude of the issues which are committed to us let us cast aside all feelings of self interest and let us act only with the desire to benefit our country to regain for her a place amongst the nations of the world loud cheers even at the cost of present sufferings and sacrifice for ourselves to bequeath to those who come after us a future of prosperity happiness and independence loud applause\n",

      "rev chairman and gentlemen it gives me very great pleasure to have the opportunity of meeting such a very influential meeting of tenant farmer delegates from the queen county delegates who might be said to represent amongst them all the practical brain and intelligence of the county mr chairman i do not know that there is very much for me to add to the excellent and sensible addresses to which we have listened from preceding speakers but i may say that the resolutions which have been prepared for your consideration appear to me to be most sensible and practical and very well worthy sic the reputation which the organisation of the land league has obtained for its practical character and sensible working in this county hear hear and i would like each one of you delegates when you go home to take with you a full understanding and perception of what these resolutions really mean and what they bind you to do in order that you may in your capacity as representative men and leaders in your different localities explain to your neighbours the result of the resolutions at which you will have arrived to day it will be your duty to represent to all your neighbours and friends the sense of this delegate meeting in order that the whole queen county may come forward as one man and may take united action at this very important juncture and crisis in the history of the irish national land league hear hear and first of all it may not be out of place for me to remind you what our movement is for our movement is for the benefit of the farmers the labourers the artisans and the traders hear hear of all classes residing in ireland who live by the work of their arm or of their brain cheers it has been our principle a principle which we hope and we are determined not to stop from our work until we have successfully carried it out in every quarter of ireland it has been our principle that the resources of this country should be for the benefit of those who work in this country hear hear whether they work by their brains or by their arms it signifies not whether by physical or mental labour the labourer was worthy of his hire and the land act as far as we may after investigation and careful testing find that we can use it is a lever for obtaining these ends it will be possible for us perhaps after we have fully tested it so to use it to a certain extent now we desire to test this act but we don't desire the tenant farmers of ireland to use it until it has been tested this is of great importance and therefore a resolution has been submitted to you to day pledging you not to go into court for the purpose of fixing a rent until you have consulted with and obtained the sanction of the local branch of the league to which you belong hear hear in this way you can preserve your union and avoid demoralising the ranks of the country it will be the duty of the local branches to select test cases in the words of the resolution of an average character where rents are neither very high nor very low our purpose in doing that is that we may encourage the court in the first instance to establish a low rather than a high standard of rent this court will be anxious at the outset to create a favourable impression amongst the tenant farmers it will be desirous of obtaining your confidence in order to win you away from the ranks of the irish national land league and from the paths of agitation cries of never and if this court could have submitted to it at the commencement of every rack rented case where they would be able to give a considerable apparent reduction without in reality reducing the rent as it ought to be reduced or to a fair standard it would be able to ride off with flowing colours and having reduced the rent as has been described to you by mr lalor having reduced the rent per cent or per cent it would call upon the tenant farmers of ireland to admire it and say see what fine fellows we are and how much we are reducing your rents but the result both as regards the rack rented tenants and as regards those tenants who until the recent bad times and american competition would have been considered to hold their land at a not unfair rent the result in both cases would be disastrous because you would have a high standard of rent established as the result of the test cases instead of a low standard whereas if cases are put into court of an average character the court will be compelled to reduce these rents to what would be a fair rent or else the court will fail in gaining the confidence of the tenant farmers of ireland hear hear now this is what we want all you tenant farmers to assist us in we don't want you to rush in each mean only mindful of his little huxtering sic bargain and trying to make terms individually with the landlord or the court we want you to stand together and await the result of the test cases we shall take and then we shall be able to give you further advice as regards your later action we propose to select test cases where the improvements of the tenants have not been very recently made and in the second instance we propose to select test cases where the improvements have been recently made and where the tenant will be able to prove these improvements we apprehend that the number of farmers of ireland in this latter class where the tenants will be able to prove their improvements is but limited but we consider that in these cases the reduction of rent if the act is fairly administered will be very large under mr healy clause because under that clause it is provided that no rent shall be allowed or made payable in any proceedings under this act in respect of improvements by the tenant or his predecessors in title and for which the tenant or his predecessors in title shall not have been paid or otherwise compensated by the landlord or his predecessors in title you will observe however that that section throws the onus of proving his improvement upon the tenant and that therefore he will not be able to gain credit in getting his rent reduced except in cases where the improvements have been recently made and where he is able to prove them in cases where the improvements have been recently made and where he is able to prove them in cases where the improvements have been made a long time ago there will be no evidence that the tenant has made those improvements although it is a matter of public notoriety that he or his father before him have made them where the improvements have been made by the predecessors in title of the tenant there will be no legal evidence that those improvements have been so made consequently as the law now stands the presumption will be that they are made by the landlord and the landlord will get the benefit of them that is a very important flaw in the act and it is a matter that we will have to obtain a legislative reform for in the future it practically will restrict the benefits of the act to but a very small class of tenants namely that class who are able to prove that they have made their improvements the class that are not able to prove that they have made their improvements will derive but little practical benefit from the measure therefore you see that at the first going off the tenantry of ireland as regards the operation of this act and the benefits to be obtain from it get divided into two classes the one class a very small one that we hope will be able to get if the act is fairly administered large abatements in their rents the other a much larger class who will not be able to obtain these reductions which the times require we propose to put in as test cases firstly cases representative of the second class we propose thoroughly to test the operations of the rent fixing clauses of the act in this way but in order that we may be able to do that it is of importance that we should have perfect discipline and union among the ranks of the tenant farmers themselves and that they should await the result of the action we propose to take in the way that i have endeavoured to describe to you meanwhile we think that tenants had better not go into the court or apply to the court for the purpose of fixing a rent for two reasons firstly statutory terms of fifteen years are very dangerous terms for you to enter into at present we are now at the commencement of a new system of american competition in corn and meat and none of us know whether before the fifteen years are up irish land will be able to pay any rent at all or not hear hear if then you go into court and ask the court to fix a fair rent and that fixing is necessarily accompanied by the condition of a fifteen years statutory term and if after five or six years of that statutory term have elapsed you find yourselves unable to pay that rent so fixed by the court what position will you be in in obtaining the moral sympathy of the world if the landlords are able to point to your own actions as the cause of the saddling upon your shoulders of these unbearable and impossible rents you will not be able to obtain the sympathy under these circumstances which would be yours if you abide by the principles of the land league and enter into no agreement to pay rent for any longer term than you can possibly help again we desire to see if that act will do anything for the tenants who have been evicted and whose period of redemption of six months has not yet expired we intend to serve notices in all these cases on the first day on which the court sits asking the court to stay these proceedings in ejectment until we see by the result of our test cases whether it will be worth while to apply in the case of those evicted tenants for the fixing of a fair rent that will prevent their period of redemption from expiring after we have served thsee sic notices hear hear we next come to the question of the labourers and i regret exceedingly as i have said elsewhere that the act does so very little for them but i would remind the tenant farmers who are present here that it will be their own fault if for the future they are unable to pay their labourers fair wages and it will be also their own fault if they are unable to give them plenty of employment on their farms you are now permitted by this act to borrow money from the board of works for purpose of improving your holdings and i should trust every tenant who has improvable land on his holding to take advantage of this section of the act in order to give employment during the coming winter at reasonable and fair wages to the labourers of this locality in this way perhaps we can do more indirectly by stimulating the labour market than in any other way i look to the working of this section by the farmers as the one from which we may hope to get more immediate benefit in the shape of giving employment and better wages to the labourer than almost anything else suggested on their behalf i would ask the farmers suggested on their behalf i would ask the farmers to take up the duty that is thrown upon them of taking care of the labourers during the coming winter whatever happens with regard to their past improvements which have been already made their future improvements never can be touched by the landlord and any improvement they may make upon the farms for the future will be for their own benefit and the benefit of their children and their children children applause a delegate are leaseholders exempt from that mr parnell leaseholders are not exempt from that portion of the act leaseholders at the expiration of their leases will be in the position of present tenants a voice but the borrowing powers mr parnell leaseholders are permitted to borrow under the act and i should imagine would be in a better position to borrow than almost any other class of tenants unless their rents are too high and i am afraid in a great many cases that that is the fact our advice and strong request to you is pending the tests we shall apply to maintain and stand by your organisation we trust to adopt a practical method for the purpose of preventing the landlords from selling your interest in your holding in future i introduced a clause into the land act for that purpose but it was thrown out by the house of lords and we shall now be obliged to fall back upon our own resources and ingenuity which i trust will be sufficient for the purpose and the landlord will be obliged to fall back upon his old remedy of ejectment and ejectment entails a six months equity of redemption which will give you time to look about you and you need not be so much afraid of ejectment as of having your interest sold which left you no period of redemption and in the meanwhile until we see the result of these test cases and take further action or change our present policy which i don't think is likely i don't see the slightest possibility of this act bringing about such reductions in the rents of the tenantry as will enable the land league to change its policy but unless this is done we recommend to you to proceed in the terms of one of these resolutions that you should appoint assessors for the purpose of estimating a fair rent on the farms in your different localities and that you shall offer this fair rent to the landlord and refuse to pay any more applause by doing this you will do more to bring about a satisfactory arrangement and reduction of your rents out of court than you could by any other line of action and i am very pleased to say that you in the queen county have adopted such a practical method of action that i believe that when i next come amongst you i shall find that the queen county has had its rents more largely reduced than perhaps any other county in ireland applause i have the greatest reverence for father o'shea and have always had but at the same time i don't approve of the advice which he has given you on the present occasion laughter he told us it was a good thing for a bundle of sticks to remain tied together if each stick wanted to be strong but i am very much afraid by the advice he has given you he was inadvertently doing his best to untie the bundle of sticks father o'shea rather begged the whole question when he assumed that if a tenant went into court the court would reduce his rent what will happen if the court raises it that is a contingency which must not be left out of sight and it is also exceedingly probable that a very large number of landlords will bring their tenants into court and the landlords will be much more anxious to use this land act for their benefit than the tenants will be if the result of the test cases that we propose to take are unsatisfactory and it is therefore of the highest importance that these test cases should be properly selected and that they should be put into court in such a way as to insure a low standard of rent as the rent which the court will adopt throughout ireland as the result of their decision in the first cases submitted it will not be necessary for the rackrented tenants to go into court to obtain a reduction of rent to the court standard when the rent has been made evident to everybody by the result of these test cases if the rackrented tenant is able to say as a result of his application to the court that he is able to obtain a reduction of his rent to a certain figure he will have no difficulty in obtaining a reduction of his rent from the landlord outside the court and that is one of our objects to get the tenants rent reduced without entailing upon himself the obligation of the statutory term and i must also take issue somewhat with my friend father feehan who warned us of the danger of taking these test cases les we should be compelled if favourable decisions are given to advise all tenants to go into court if favourable decisions are given so far from its being necessary for us to advise all the tenants to go into court quite the reverse in my opinion would happen because every tenant would be able to obtain from his landlord a reduction of his rent in such a case to the standard established by these test cases without any necessity of going into court at all then i say if the result is not favourable to the tenant he will have not object in going into court because he could have nothing to hope for or gain by an application to the court so that in any case whether the result of the test cases is favourable or not so far from its leading to an indiscriminate rush of tenants into court it will operate in precisely the reverse way in one case it will lead to a settlement out of court it will operate in precisely the reverse way in one case it will lead to a settlement out of court and in the other case it will also lead to a settlement out of court by the irresistable sic strength and organisation of the irish national land league applause\n",

      "the chairman said one of the resolutions which would be proposed for their adoption and approval was one adopted at the national convention held on the 17th ult he thought it would be well for him to give them an outline of what the resolutions adopted at the national convention provided first of all it was provided that the executive should be empowered to select test cases in different localities throughout ireland for the purpose of testing the operation of the new land act secondly it was recommended that no tenant farmer member of the league should go into the court for the purpose of having a rent fixed pending the decision upon these test cases when the executive would be in a better position to make further recommendations to the country generally thirdly it was provided that every farmer should give half an acre of land for every twenty five acres of land in his possession to the labourers in his employment and that he should give this land prepared for a crop at the same rate which he himself paid for the land hear hear these were the three principal resolutions adopted at the convention with the exception of that referring to home manufacture hear which he did not propose to go into just at this moment now the executive in pursuance of the first of those resolutions desired that each branch of the land league in the county waterford should select one test case and forward particulars with regard to that case to dublin in order that it might be brought before the court for the purpose of fixing the rent the executive desired test cases should be selected from neither a very high nor a very low rent something about the poor law valuation or perhaps or per cent over it would he thought be a fair test case to select in most districts in the county waterford the executive considered that when they had obtained a decision from the court in regard to these cases they would in the first place have secured that the court would have fixed the rent at as a sic low a standard as they could possibly induce the court to so fix the rent and secondly they would have shown each farmer in that branch by making a test case in his own immediate vicinity what the court would do in his case what level the court would fix rent at in his case if he himself applied to the court the farmer would therefore be in a position to judge for himself as to whether the level of the rent which would be fixed by the court in his case would be satisfactory to him or not if the level of the rent so fixed was likely to be satisfactory to him he would be able in combination with other tenants to go to his landlord and say we will pay you this rent and not any more and he would be able to obtain from the landlord his farm at that rent without going into court at all if on the other hand he was dissatisfied with the prospect before him as regarded an application to the court he would stand by the organisation of the land league and endeavour to get his rent reduced as he was doing at the present time applause so that in any case whether the decision of the court was satisfactory to them or not in the test cases submitted it would be possible for them to work without making an application to the court without binding themselves down to the statutory term of fifteen years and without leaving the organisation of the irish national land league it was of great importance that the resources of farmers should not be wasted in law costs and the executive considered the plan they had adopted was the one best calculated to enable the tenant farmers to obtain suitable abatements of their rents without going to the expense of making an application to the court to do it for them in the meanwhile they hoped that the farmers who were not selected as test cases would continue to act as they had done up to the present hear hear it was perfectly dishonest of the irish tenant farmers to go on paying high rents to the landlords and so leave themselves unable to fulfil their ordinary obligations to society at large pending the decision of these test cases he should therefore recommend the farmers to maintain a very firm and resolute attitude and if the landlord refused to take a fair rent they should stand by their combination and refuse to pay him any rent at all until he came to his senses laughter and applause the question of what a fair rent was was one of degree the land league from the commencement had refused to recommend the tenant farmer to pay no rent at all they were aware of course that some gentlemen of great influence and experience had recommended that they should raise the standard of no rent he had always been opposed to that because it would take the clergy from them and would lead to a division in their ranks but going on the principle of a fair and just rent to the landlord which he would define as the original value of the land before it was improved by the tenant or his predecessors for the landlord all the value added by the exertions of the tenant should go to the tenant applause the land of ireland derived at least nine tenths of its present value from the exertions of the tenants and their forefathers and if they carried their principle of a fair rent it would come to this for every their farm was worth the landlord should get 2s as the fair rent applause the failure in practical effect of the act was that the presumption of improvements was in favour of the landlord and against the tenant and if they could reverse that they would pull down the rental of ireland from sixteen or seventeen millions to two or three millions a year the landlords were not entitled morally to the value which the tenants put into the land and the league could claim the support of every right thinking man in the movement they had set on foot abolition of irish landlordism applause their programme was a right one and a reasonable one and a possible one he felt it was unnecessary for him to press upon them the necessity of dealing justly with the labourers the labourers had stood patiently with them in this movement and had stood better than some farmers themselves hear hear and as they were a long suffering class it was right the farmers should say what they would do in their behalf hear next to the drain of money from this country by the irish landlords come the drain of money for the purpose in buying articles of foreign manufacture the irish landlords got about seventeen millions out of the country the english government got about eight millions out of the country in the shape of taxes and then for goods that were made in england they paid twenty millions a year oh so that practically speaking out of fifteen millions acres of cultivated land in ireland they were paying forty five millions sterling nearly all of which went out of the country it would be of enormous importance if they could get this twenty millions or a considerable portion of it kept at home and what they wanted every member of the land league priest or layman to do was to pledge himself that he would wear nothing but what was made in ireland applause he was afraid that up to the present they could not ask the lady land leaguers to join them in this movement but the time would come when they could as regarded the men they ought to pledge in the most unreserved manner he was told there was a twill made at blarney which would make very good cloth for the clergy they proposed then to have as one of the rules of the land league that every member of the league should use only articles of irish manufacture where it was possible for him to get them mr parnell concluded in conclusion let me impress upon you the necessity of holding yourselves together i believe that this act can be in some respects used in such a way as to strengthen rather than weaken your organisation but you must go strictly on disciplined lines you must stand together no tenant must run in and make his little huckstering bargain with the landlord by himself applause your organisation in the county waterford is not nearly so close as it ought to be but i trust to take some practical steps within the course of a few days that will supply any deficiencies existing i will ask you to go home and remember that great sacrifices have been made for you during the past winter michael davitt applause was not a tenant farmer and he had nothing to gain but everything to lose by the movement and although you might be tempted to gain some little advantage for yourselves yet you must remember that it is your duty to stand by the whole country the whole people we wish to develop the resources of ireland in such a way that all classes in ireland who work may be benefitter sic by it we desire to do away with the selfishness which landlord and english rule has unfortunately planted in some sections of the community and that we may all go on together unitedly determined that nothing shall stop us until we have i won't say what loud laughter and applause at all events there can be no bounds to the march of ireland progress we can set no termination to the progress of a nation ireland is entitled to her full rights as a nation if she can get them and at all events we are determined to get as much as we can applause the chairman you may say they did not give in the chairman they might just as well have given in first as last that is what we have been telling you all along that is what we have been telling you all along i would much rather these tenants had gone and taken the abatement offered them than that they should have made a half fight and given in in the end hear hear you are asking the executive after lord waterford has got his full rack rent a thing against all the principles of the league applause actually to pay a lot of costs out of money contributed by the hard working irish and american people many of whom work ten times as hard as many irish farmers i have seen those people going to their work two hours before daybreak and working until after dark and then bringing perhaps a week wages to the league to be sent over here to help you rich farmers to make a sham fight applause the application is a perfectly disgraceful one and one which i cannot sanction applause we have had a good legal opinion that all the sales since the passing of the land act are illegal and if the marquis of waterford tenants had held out the sales would have been perfectly invalid and they would have had a good action against the sheriff for damages hear hear the chairman said they had already sent out forms requesting particulars as to any losses that had been forced upon members of the branches and the executive were taking steps to prevent lapse of time running against any evicted tenant or any compulsory shareholder the chairman you must settle that yourselves you cannot expect me to take everything on my shoulders\n",
